# Builds MekHQ for CI (and CD via artifacts)
#
# Jobs:
#
#    - ci_cd: Build MekHQ for CI/CD on Ubuntu with Java 1.8
#        - This job will use MM and MML source directly
#          for the build.
#
#    - other_os_ci: Build MekHQ on Windows and MacOS.
#        - This job runs after `ci_cd` completes successfully.
