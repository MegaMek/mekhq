(Unofficial) Advanced Medical:
Advanced Medical (AM) is intended to replace the standard Battletech method of dealing with injuries and add a level of realism for
campaign play. Using AM, each pilot hit is assigned to a specific body location (head, left arm, right arm, chest, abdomen,
left leg or right leg) and each hit has a chance to be a critical hit that causes double damage & additionally the chance for
critical hits increases based on the number of hits the soldier has suffered. The amount of hits a location suffers determines
the level of the injury. Injuries can range from cuts/bruises that require almost no medical attention and do not affect combat
performance, to broken bones that temporarily affect combat performance to lost limbs that permanently affect combat skill.

Using AM most pilots with 1 hit will be back in the field the next day with  no repercussions, while a  pilot with 5 hits will
vary from the very lucky that end up with no/almost no time out (assuming few or no critical hits and all of the hits landing
on different locations) to losing a limb or suffering other long term or permanent injury.
