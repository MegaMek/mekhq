This file provides MekHQ with the information it needs to select a given RAT based on a set of criteria.

The file consists of multiple <rat> nodes, each of which is associated with a particular source and era. If a given source has tables for more than one year (e.g. Xotl has 3028, 3039, 3050, and 3052), each year goes into a separate node.

The <rat> tag takes two required attributes: name and era.
Each <rat> node contains one or more <faction> nodes.

The <faction> tag requires the code attribute, which must be set to one of the codes from the factions.xml file, or one of the generic values "General", "Periphery", or "Clan".
Each <faction> node has one or more unit nodes.

Unit nodes can take any of the following tags: <mech>, <vehicle>, <aerospace>, <dropship>, <infantry>, <battlearmor>, <protomech>.
The <mech>, <vehicle>, and <aerospace> tags may take a "weight" attribute with one of the following values: "light", "medium", "heavy", [mech and vehicle only:] "assault". If the weight attribute is left out, the same tables will be used for all weight classes of that unit type. If a weight attribute is used, there should be an entry for all weight classes appropriate for the type of unit. In cases where a chart covers multiple weight classes (e.g. light/medium and heavy/assault) there should be an entry for both weight classes with the same contents.

The content of the unit type node is one or more RAT names, separated by a pipe (|) and arranged from the lowest quality to the highest (in most cases F, D, C, B, A). Note that this is the name that appears on the first line of the file after any comments, not the file name. If there are fewer than five, these will be mapped onto A-F, rounding down (e.g. C|B|A will understood as C=D+F, B=B+C, A=A). The mapping can be made explicit by repeating names: C|B|B|B|A would equate A with A and C with F, but B for all others. If there are six listed, the last is interpreted as A*. If there are fewer than six tables the mapping must be made explicitly, such as in War of '39 Kurita and FRR tables: C|C|B|B|A|A*.

After the <rat> nodes there are a series of <altTable> nodes which give additional factions that should be checked if the RAT source does not have a table for the main faction.
