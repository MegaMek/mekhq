ALTRUISTIC.label=Altruistic
ALTRUISTIC.description.0=Others come first - always. {0} willingly steps into danger to\
  \ protect {6} unit, gives up resources without hesitation, and never asks for anything in return.\
  \ Strength, in {6} eyes, is meant to shield, not to exploit.
ALTRUISTIC.description.1=No sacrifice is too great if it means saving others. {0} pushes\
  \ {4}self past exhaustion, taking the hardest missions and making the toughest calls, even when\
  \ no one asks {4} to. Eventually, {2} may give too much - leaving nothing of {4}self behind.
ALTRUISTIC.description.2=A firm believer in the greater good, {0} acts with a generosity\
  \ that others mistake for naivety. {5} willingness to help, even when it puts {4} at a\
  \ disadvantage, earns {4} both deep respect and ruthless exploitation from those less honorable.
ALTRUISTIC.description.3={0} doesn''t hesitate to put {4}self on the line for others. Whether\
  \ shielding an ally from harm, sharing {6} last supply cache, or standing up for those who can''t\
  \ fight for themselves, {2} {7, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} true strength is measured by how much\
  \ you can give.
ALTRUISTIC.description.4=To {0}, leadership isn''t about power - it''s about responsibility. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes} the weight of others'' burdens without complaint, ensuring that no\
  \ one suffers alone, even when it means carrying more than {2} should.
ALTRUISTIC.description.5={0}''s selflessness is both {6} greatest strength and {6} biggest\
  \ vulnerability. {1} {7, choice, 0#give|1#gives} without hesitation, {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ without expecting reward, and {7, choice, 0#sacrifice|1#sacrifices} without regret - sometimes\
  \ forgetting that even {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} limits.
ALTRUISTIC.ronin=I''m not looking for glory, and I''m not here for a payday. I''m here because I believe\
  \ strength isn''t about how much you can take - it''s about how much you can give.\
  <p>You know as well as I do that this line of work can grind people down. It makes you hard, selfish\
  \ - and that''s when things start to break. You need someone who''s willing to carry more than their\
  \ share of the weight, to take the hits so others don''t have to. That''s what I bring. I''m not afraid\
  \ to bleed for the unit. I''ve done it before, and I''ll do it again.</p>\
  <p>So, {0} - you want someone who''s in it for themselves? Or someone who''s in it for you?</p>
ALTRUISTIC.interviewerNote.0=Would rather bleed than watch someone else suffer.
ALTRUISTIC.interviewerNote.1=Carries the weight no one asked them to - and might break under it.
ALTRUISTIC.interviewerNote.2=Too good for this business. Won''t last unless someone watches their back.
ALTRUISTIC.interviewerNote.3=Walks into fire without hesitation - calls it leadership.
ALTRUISTIC.interviewerNote.4=Gives everything. Might not leave enough to survive on.
ALTRUISTIC.interviewerNote.5=Backbone of the team - and the one most likely to be left behind.

APATHETIC.description.1=After seeing too much death and betrayal, {0} has stopped caring.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} form attachments, {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} believe in causes,\
  \ and {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} waste energy on emotions. In {6} mind, caring only leads to\
  \ pain.
APATHETIC.description.2=The universe is broken, and {0} knows it. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ get involved in arguments, {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} waste time on idealism, and certainly\
  \ {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} stick {6} neck out for anyone. As far as {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ concerned, nothing really matters in the long run.
APATHETIC.description.3={0} moves through life like a ghost, detached from the surrounding chaos.\
  \ Orders are followed, tasks are completed, but there''s no fire behind {6} actions - just a quiet\
  \ acceptance that nothing really changes.
APATHETIC.description.4=Once, {0} might have cared. Now, {2} just {7, choice, 0#drift|1#drifts}.\
  \ Wars rage, alliances shift, people come and go, and none of it moves {4}. {1} {7, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ what''s necessary to get by, but passion and purpose are long-forgotten luxuries.
APATHETIC.description.5={0}''s indifference isn''t an act - it''s survival. {1}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ seen too much, lost too much, and learned that the only way to endure is to stop feeling\
  \ altogether. The universe burns, but {2} stopped worrying about the flames a long time ago.
APATHETIC.ronin=If you''re looking for someone passionate about the cause - someone who''ll rally the\
  \ troops and fight for some grand ideal - you''re talking to the wrong person. I''m not here to save\
  \ the galaxy, or even to save you. I''m here because I know how to survive.\
  <p>That''s why I''m useful. I don''t get attached, I don''t hesitate, and I don''t let emotion cloud my\
  \ judgment. I follow orders, I get the job done, and I don''t waste time worrying about the fallout.\
  \ You need someone who''ll keep their head when things get messy - someone who isn''t going to crack\
  \ under pressure or let sentiment get in the way.</p>
APATHETIC.interviewerNote.0=Clock punches in, clock punches out - soul never showed up.
APATHETIC.interviewerNote.1=Seen too much, feels nothing. Not dead - just numb.
APATHETIC.interviewerNote.2=Doesn't fight. Doesn't flinch. Doesn't care.
APATHETIC.interviewerNote.3=Operates on autopilot. Body moves. Mind''s already gone.
APATHETIC.interviewerNote.4=Burned out long before we met them. Just ash in uniform.
APATHETIC.interviewerNote.5=Hollow eyes. Doesn't hate you - just can''t be bothered to.

  \ exactly what you get.
AUTHENTIC.description.1=No sugarcoating, no empty promises - {0} tells it like it is,\
  \ whether people want to hear it or not. {1} {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to play politics or\
  \ pretend to be something {2} {7, choice, 0#aren''t|1#isn''t}, even if it makes {4} enemies.
AUTHENTIC.description.2=People trust {0} because {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} real. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} fake emotions, {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} manipulate, and\
  \ {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} care about putting on an act. {5} honesty may be blunt at\
  \ times, but it makes {4} both respected and reliable.
AUTHENTIC.description.3={0} never hides behind false pretenses or empty words. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#stand|1#stands} by {6} beliefs, never bending to fit expectations, and\
  \ {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} no apologies for who {2} {7, choice, 0#are|1#is} - whether people\
  \ like it or not.
AUTHENTIC.description.4=In a universe full of deception, {0} is refreshingly straightforward. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#say|1#says} what {2} {7, choice, 0#mean|1#means}, {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} what {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#promise|1#promises}, and {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to play games just to gain\
  \ favor. {5} word is one of the few things that can be trusted.
AUTHENTIC.description.5={0} doesn''t waste time on pretenses. {1} {7, choice, 0#live|1#lives} by {6}\
  \ own code, unshaken by outside pressure, and {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to compromise who\
  \ {2} {7, choice, 0#are|1#is} just to fit someone else''s version of how {2} should be.
AUTHENTIC.ronin=I''m not going to waste your time with some rehearsed pitch or polished speech. That''s\
  \ not how I operate. What you see is exactly what you get. I don''t do masks, I don''t play politics,\
  \ and I sure as hell don''t put on an act to impress anyone - not even you.\
  <p>You want someone who''ll tell you what you want to hear? Keep looking. If you bring me on,\
  \ you''re getting the truth, whether it''s comfortable or not. If the plan''s bad, I''ll tell you.\
  \ If we''re walking into a death trap, you''ll know about it before we step into it. I don''t sugarcoat,\
  \ and I don''t spin facts to protect feelings.</p>\
  <p>Your call, {0}.</p>
AUTHENTIC.interviewerNote.0=What you see is what you get - no polish, no bullshit.
AUTHENTIC.interviewerNote.1=Tells the truth even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts.
AUTHENTIC.interviewerNote.2=Doesn't fake it. Won't break it. Trustworthy to a fault.
AUTHENTIC.interviewerNote.3=No masks. No spin. Just one stubborn, honest bastard.
AUTHENTIC.interviewerNote.4=Straight shooter. Won''t bend, won''t budge, won''t lie.
AUTHENTIC.interviewerNote.5=The only genuine article in a warehouse full of forgeries.
BLUNT.label=Blunt
BLUNT.description.0={0} says exactly what''s on {6} mind, with no concern for sugarcoating\
  \ or social niceties. If the truth is harsh, so be it - {2} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} no point in\
  \ dressing it up.
BLUNT.description.1=There''s no room for pleasantries in {0}''s world. {1} {7, choice, 0#deliver|1#delivers}\
  \ the hard truths, whether people can handle them or not, cutting through delusion with words as\
  \ sharp as a blade. If someone''s weak, incompetent, or making a mistake, {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes}\
  \ sure they know it.
BLUNT.description.2=While others waste time with diplomacy, {0} gets straight to the\
  \ point. {1} {7, choice, 0#value|1#values} efficiency over politeness and doesn''t believe in dancing\
  \ around the truth. Some find {6} approach refreshing - others just find it frustrating.
BLUNT.description.3={0} doesn''t deal in half-truths or carefully worded pleasantries. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#call|1#calls} things exactly as {2} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} them, no matter how\
  \ uncomfortable it makes people - because, to {4}, honesty is more valuable than diplomacy.
BLUNT.description.4=Subtlety has never been {0}''s strong suit. {1} {7, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks}\
  \ in hard facts and brutal honesty, never sugarcoating {6} words or wasting time on delicate\
  \ phrasing. If someone doesn''t like it, that''s their problem.
BLUNT.description.5={0} sees no reason to dance around the truth. Whether it''s giving orders,\
  \ delivering bad news, or calling someone out on their mistakes, {2} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ soften the blow - because in {6} mind, reality doesn''t come with padding.
BLUNT.ronin=Let''s skip the formalities - they''re a waste of time. You don''t want someone who''s going\
  \ to dance around the truth, and I''m not interested in playing games. You want results? You''ll get\
  \ them. You want someone who''ll tell you what you want to hear instead of what you need to hear?\
  \ Keep looking.\
  <p>If you want soft words and careful diplomacy, hire someone else. But if you want someone who''ll\
  \ tell you exactly how it is - and make sure you live to see another day - you know where to find\
  \ me.</p>
BLUNT.interviewerNote.0=Doesn''t mince words - just carves straight to the bone.
BLUNT.interviewerNote.1=Cuts through bullshit like a vibroblade.
BLUNT.interviewerNote.2=Talks like time is short and patience shorter.
BLUNT.interviewerNote.3=Says the thing everyone else avoids - loud, clear, and on purpose.
BLUNT.interviewerNote.4=Subtle as artillery. Doesn't care who flinches.
BLUNT.interviewerNote.5=Truth hits hard. So do they. Doesn't apologize for either.
CALLOUS.label=Callous
CALLOUS.description.0={0} doesn''t get attached. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} suffering, loss, and\
  \ hardship, but none of it seems to affect {4}. Whether it''s a defense mechanism or just who {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#are|1#is}, {2} {7, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} {6} emotions locked away and\
  \ {7, choice, 0#move|1#moves} forward without hesitation.
CALLOUS.description.1=Compassion is a weakness {0} can''t afford. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ hesitate to make hard decisions, sacrifice allies, or eliminate threats with cold efficiency. In\
  \ {6} mind, survival means shutting out anything that might make {4} hesitate.
CALLOUS.description.2={0} believes in results, not feelings. {1} {7, choice, 0#dismisse|1#dismisses}\
  \ emotions as distractions and {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to waste time comforting others. To\
  \ {4}, facts, logic, and action matter - sympathy does not.
CALLOUS.description.3={0} moves through life with a hardened heart. Death, betrayal, and suffering\
  \ don''t faze {4} - they''re just the natural order of things. {1} {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} what needs\
  \ to be done and doesn''t waste time mourning the cost.
CALLOUS.description.4={0} doesn''t believe in second chances or sentimental attachments. If someone\
  \ can''t keep up, they''re left behind. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} emotions as liabilities, and\
  \ nothing - not guilt, grief, or regret - will slow {4} down.
CALLOUS.description.5={0} has seen too much, lost too much, to care anymore. The only thing that\
  \ matters is getting the job done, and if that means making brutal decisions, so be it. In {6}\
  \ world, kindness is just another word for weakness.
CALLOUS.ronin=Compassion? Mercy? Those are luxuries you can''t afford when you''re trying to survive\
  \ out here.\
  \ <p>I''ve seen people hesitate because they cared too much - they didn''t last long. When the time\
  \ comes to pull the trigger, I won''t freeze. If cutting someone loose means the rest of us make\
  \ it out alive, I''ll do it. No questions, no hesitation.</p>\
  <p>I don''t need approval. I need a contract.</p>
CALLOUS.interviewerNote.0=Cold eyes. War''s just numbers and meat to this one.
CALLOUS.interviewerNote.1=Cuts ties as easily as throats - doesn''t blink.
CALLOUS.interviewerNote.2=No room for grief. Moves on before the body hits the ground.
CALLOUS.interviewerNote.3=Doesn't flinch, doesn't linger - just keeps walking.
CALLOUS.interviewerNote.4=Past the point of caring. Job gets done. That''s all.
CALLOUS.interviewerNote.5=Bleeds others, not themself. Doesn''t lose sleep.
COMPASSIONATE.label=Compassionate
COMPASSIONATE.description.0={0} genuinely cares about the people around {4}. {1} {7, choice, 0#look|1#looks}\
  \ out for {6} unit, {7, choice, 0#help|1#helps} those in need, and {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} what\
  \ {2} can to make life a little less cruel - even in a universe that doesn''t reward kindness.
COMPASSIONATE.description.1=Caring is a curse {0} can''t shake. {1} {7, choice, 0#feel|1#feels} the\
  \ weight of every loss, every sacrifice, and every person {2} couldn''t save. No matter how much it\
  \ hurts, {2} {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to stop trying - because if {2} {7, choice, 0#do|1#does},\
  \ {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} no better than the monsters {2} {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}.
COMPASSIONATE.description.2={0}''s compassion isn''t just a trait - it''s {6} strength. {5}\
  \ ability to see the good in people, to uplift those around {4}, and to fight not just for\
  \ {4}self, but for others, makes {4} a leader that people want to follow.
COMPASSIONATE.description.3={0} doesn''t just fight for survival - {2} {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ for people. {1} never {7, choice, 0#turn|1#turns} {6} back on those in need, always willing to\
  \ lend a hand, a shoulder, or a second chance, even when the universe gives {4} every reason not\
  \ to.
COMPASSIONATE.description.4=No matter how ruthless the battlefield becomes, {0} refuses to let it\
  \ harden {4}. {1} {7, choice, 0#protect|1#protects}, {2} {7, choice, 0#comfort|1#comforts}, and {2}\
  \ never {7, choice, 0#forget|1#forgets} that behind every fight, there are lives that still matter.
COMPASSIONATE.description.5={0} carries the burdens of others without hesitation. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#listen|1#listens}, {2} {7, choice, 0#understand|1#understands}, and {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#lead|1#leads} with heart - because to {4}, strength isn''t about power, but about\
  \ standing tall when others can''t.
COMPASSIONATE.ronin=Look, I know the kind of people who survive in this business. Hardened. Ruthless.\
  \ Cold. That''s not me. And I''m not going to pretend it is.\
  <p>I care. That''s my problem - and my strength. I''ve been in the scrum with people who would\
  \ sell out their own team for a better contract. Seen warriors walk away from injured comrades\
  \ because they weren''t worth the trouble. That''s not how I operate. If someone''s down, I''m getting\
  \ them back on their feet. If there''s a way to protect the people under my care, I''ll find it -\
  \ even if it puts me at risk.</p>\
  <p>Let me tag along, and you''ll get a fighter who doesn''t give up on people - and that''s exactly\
  \ the kind of strength that wins wars.</p>
COMPASSIONATE.interviewerNote.0=Soft heart. Watches backs, not just flanks.
COMPASSIONATE.interviewerNote.1=Hurts with every loss. Still shows up. Still cares.
COMPASSIONATE.interviewerNote.2=Morale anchor. People don''t just follow - they believe.
COMPASSIONATE.interviewerNote.3=Doesn''t break under fire - protects under fire.
COMPASSIONATE.interviewerNote.4=Refuses to harden. Calls that strength.
COMPASSIONATE.interviewerNote.5=Leads from the front, heart wide open. Risky - but damn effective.
CONDESCENDING.label=Condescending
CONDESCENDING.description.0={0} talks to people like they''re always a step behind {4} -\
  \ because in {6} mind, they usually are. {1} {7, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} {2} {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ best, rarely listens to advice, and has little patience for those who can''t keep up.
CONDESCENDING.description.1={0} doesn''t just look down on others - {2} barely\
  \ {7, choice, 0#acknowledge|1#acknowledges} them. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} most people as\
  \ incompetent, useless, or beneath {4}, and {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} no effort to hide {6}\
  \ disdain. If someone disagrees with {4}, {2} {7, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} they''re simply too\
  \ stupid to understand.
CONDESCENDING.description.2={0} always has a smug remark loaded, making it painfully clear\
  \ {2} {7, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} the smartest person in the room. Whether\
  \ through subtle jabs or outright mockery, {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} a way of making others feel\
  \ small without ever raising {6} voice.
CONDESCENDING.description.3={0} doesn''t argue - {2} {7, choice, 0#explain|1#explains}, as if talking\
  \ to a child who just can''t grasp the obvious. Every interaction feels like a lesson, delivered\
  \ with an exasperated sigh and the unshakable certainty that {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} always right.
CONDESCENDING.description.4={0}''s tone alone is enough to set people on edge. Whether it''s the\
  \ slow, deliberate way {2} {7, choice, 0#correct|1#corrects} others or the way {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#smirk|1#smirks} when they struggle, {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} it painfully\
  \ clear that {2} {7, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} leagues ahead of everyone else.
CONDESCENDING.description.5=Even when {0} offers help, it comes wrapped in barely concealed\
  \ disdain. {5} advice drips with superiority, {6} compliments feel backhanded, and every\
  \ conversation leaves people wondering if they''ve just been insulted.
CONDESCENDING.ronin=Let''s not waste time pretending we''re equals - because we''re not. I know exactly\
  \ what I bring to the table, and I''m not here to downplay it to make others feel comfortable.\
  <p>I''ve been in more operations than most warriors will see in their lifetime. I''ve studied tactics\
  \ that others can''t even begin to comprehend. When I give advice, it''s not a suggestion - it''s the\
  \ right answer. If someone wants to argue with me, that''s fine - they''re welcome to figure out how\
  \ wrong they are when the bullets start flying.</p>\
  <p>So let''s skip the pleasantries, {0}. If you want to win, you need someone who sees the\
  \ bigger picture - someone who''s already two steps ahead of the game. So stop wasting\
  \ my time and make this happen.</p>
CONDESCENDING.interviewerNote.0=Talks down like it''s the only direction they know.
CONDESCENDING.interviewerNote.1=Doesn''t debate - dismisses. Everyone else? Background noise.
CONDESCENDING.interviewerNote.2=Smirks before they speak. You know the tone.
CONDESCENDING.interviewerNote.3=Every correction feels like a lecture. Grates on nerves fast.
CONDESCENDING.interviewerNote.4=Even praise feels like punishment. Might make enemies just by talking.
CONDESCENDING.interviewerNote.5=Leads with ego. Expects everyone to thank them for the privilege.
CONSIDERATE.label=Considerate

  \ warrior. {1} {7, choice, 0#watch|1#watches} out for those who can''t protect themselves, even when\

CONSIDERATE.description.2={0} isn''t loud about {6} kindness, but it''s there. A quiet word\

  <p>This isn''t about being soft - it''s about being smart. A strong unit isn''t just made up of\
