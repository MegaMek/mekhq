ALTRUISTIC.label=Altruistic
ALTRUISTIC.description.0=Others come first - always. {0} willingly steps into danger to\
  \ protect {6} team, gives up resources without hesitation, and never asks for anything in return.\
  \ Strength, in {6} eyes, is meant to shield, not to exploit.
ALTRUISTIC.description.1=No sacrifice is too great if it means saving others. {0} pushes\
  \ {4}self past exhaustion, taking the hardest missions and making the toughest calls, even when\

ALTRUISTIC.description.2=A firm believer in the greater good, {0} acts with a generosity\

  \ exactly what you get.
AUTHENTIC.description.1=No sugarcoating, no empty promises - {0} tells it like it is,\

  \ {2} isn''t, even if it makes {4} enemies.
AUTHENTIC.description.2=People trust {0} because {2}''s real. {1} doesn''t fake emotions,\

BLUNT.description.2=While others waste time with diplomacy, {0} gets straight to the\

  \ Some find {6} approach refreshing - others just find it frustrating.

CALLOUS.label=Callous
CALLOUS.description.0={0} doesn''t get attached. {1} sees suffering, loss, and hardship, but\
  \ none of it seems to affect {4}. Whether it''s a defense mechanism or just who {2} is, {2} keeps\
  \ {6} emotions locked away and moves forward without hesitation.
CALLOUS.description.1=Compassion is a weakness {0} can''t afford. {1} doesn''t hesitate to\

  \ survival means shutting out anything that might make {4} hesitate.
CALLOUS.description.2={0} believes in results, not feelings. {1} dismisses emotions as\

COMPASSIONATE.description.0={0} genuinely cares about the people around {4}. {1} looks out\
  \ for {6} team, helps those in need, and does what {2} can to make life a little less cruel - even\

COMPASSIONATE.description.2={0}''s compassion isn''t just a trait - it''s {6} strength. {5}\

CONDESCENDING.label=Condescending
CONDESCENDING.description.0={0} talks to people like they''re always a step behind {4} -\

CONDESCENDING.description.1={0} doesn''t just look down on others - {2} barely acknowledges\
  \ them. {1} sees most people as incompetent, useless, or beneath {4}, and {2} makes no effort to\

  \ understand.
CONDESCENDING.description.2={0} always has a smug remark loaded, making it painfully clear\

  \ mockery, {2} has a way of making others feel small without ever raising {6} voice.

CONSIDERATE.label=Considerate

  \ help without being asked, {2} makes sure people feel valued and respected.
CONSIDERATE.description.1=In a ruthless world, {0} refuses to become another heartless\

  \ weight of every choice lingers in {6} mind, but {2}''d rather carry it than let others suffer.
CONSIDERATE.description.2={0} isn''t loud about {6} kindness, but it''s there. A quiet word\
  \ of encouragement, a favor done without asking for thanks, or a small sacrifice to make\

  \ or not.

DISINGENUOUS.label=Disingenuous
DISINGENUOUS.description.0={0} knows exactly what to say to get people on {6} side, but\
  \ {6} words rarely match {6} true intentions. {1} smiles, flatters, and makes promises, but\
  \ beneath it all, {2}''s only looking out for {4}self.
DISINGENUOUS.description.1=Every word {0} speaks is calculated. {1} twists the truth, plays\
  \ people against each other, and pretends to care just enough to gain trust before using it to\
  \ {6} advantage. If someone thinks {2}''s being sincere, they''re already {6} next victim.
DISINGENUOUS.description.2={0} never gives a straight answer. {1} dodges questions, avoids\
  \ commitments, and keeps people guessing about where {2} really stands. It''s not outright lying -\
  \ it''s just never letting anyone get close enough to see the truth.

DISMISSIVE.label=Dismissive
DISMISSIVE.description.0={0} doesn''t waste time on people or ideas {2} deems unimportant.\
  \ If {2} thinks someone''s opinion is useless, {2} brushes them off without a second thought and\
  \ moves forward on {6} own terms.
DISMISSIVE.description.1={0} has seen too much to care about petty concerns. {1} ignores\
  \ emotions, disregards complaints, and barely acknowledges those {2} considers beneath {4}. If\
  \ someone isn''t immediately useful, they might as well not exist.
DISMISSIVE.description.2={0} rarely takes others seriously, rolling {6} eyes at concerns\
  \ {2} doesn''t find valid. Whether it''s a risky plan, a personal grievance, or a suggestion {2}\

  \ speech, or a simple "You''ve got this."

ERRATIC.label=Erratic

  \ cautious and methodical; the next, {2}''s diving headfirst into chaos. {5} unpredictability keeps\
  \ enemies - and sometimes allies - on edge.
ERRATIC.description.1=There''s no telling what {0} will do next, and that''s what makes {4}\
  \ dangerous. {5} moods swing wildly, {6} plans shift without warning, and {6} reactions can be as\
  \ destructive to {6} allies as they are to {6} enemies.
ERRATIC.description.2={0} thrives on spontaneity, making split-second decisions that seem\

  \ stranger, {2} treats everyone with kindness and respect.

  \ waiting for the moment when trust becomes a liability.
FRIENDLY.description.2={0} can talk to anyone and make them feel like an old friend. {5}\

GREGARIOUS.description.1=Laughter and stories are {6} armor. {0} keeps the energy high and\

INDIFFERENT.label=Indifferent
INDIFFERENT.description.0={0} doesn''t get involved unless {2} has to. Other people''s\
  \ problems, moral dilemmas, or even the bigger picture don''t concern {4} - {2} focuses on what\
  \ directly affects {4} and ignores the rest.
INDIFFERENT.description.1=Nothing moves {0} anymore. Loss, suffering, and chaos are just\

  \ take things personally, {2} simply shrugs and moves on.

INTROVERTED.label=Introverted
INTROVERTED.description.0={0} prefers to observe rather than dominate a conversation. {1}\
  \ speaks when necessary, keeps {6} thoughts to {4}self, and tends to recharge best when {2}''s\
  \ alone rather than in a crowd.
INTROVERTED.description.1=People exhaust {4}, and trust is a luxury {2} can''t afford. {0}\
  \ keeps {6} distance, avoids unnecessary interactions, and only engages when absolutely\
  \ necessary. Solitude isn''t just a preference - it''s survival.
INTROVERTED.description.2=While {2} doesn''t seek attention, {0} notices everything. {1}\
  \ listens more than {2} speaks, analyzes before {2} acts, and values deep conversations over\

  \ share them.

IRRITABLE.label=Irritable

  \ comms. {0} is always on edge, snapping at allies and enemies alike. Whether it''s stress,\
  \ trauma, or just who {2} is, {6} temper is a fuse ready to blow.
IRRITABLE.description.2={0} is the guy who sighs loudly when someone asks a dumb\

  \ just how exceptional {2} is.
NARCISSISTIC.description.1=Everything revolves around {4} - at least, that''s how {2} sees it.\
  \ {0} uses people for {6} own gain, dismisses anyone who doesn''t serve {6} interests, and\
  \ considers loyalty a one-way street where {2}''s always at the top.
NARCISSISTIC.description.2={0} loves the spotlight and works hard to stay in it. {1}\
  \ boasts, exaggerates, and makes sure {6} victories are as public as possible. While {6} ego can\
  \ be exhausting, {6} charm and sheer confidence make it hard to completely dislike {4}.

NEGLECTFUL.label=Neglectful
NEGLECTFUL.description.0={0} doesn''t intentionally ignore responsibilities - {2} just gets\
  \ caught up in {6} own world. Whether it''s distractions, forgetfulness, or a lack of\
  \ organization, things tend to slip through the cracks more often than they should.
NEGLECTFUL.description.1={0} simply doesn''t care. Duties, relationships, and even {6} own\
  \ well-being are secondary to whatever {2} deems important at the moment. If something - or someone\
  \ - falls apart because of {6} inattention, that''s their problem, not {6}.
NEGLECTFUL.description.2=Keeping up with details isn''t a priority for {0}. {1} does the\

  \ entertaining.

  \ about {6} greatness than actually proving it. {1} overcomplicates simple ideas, inserts {4}self\

  \ when it''s not.

UNTRUSTWORTHY.label=Untrustworthy
UNTRUSTWORTHY.description.0={0} has a reputation for bending the truth, cutting corners,\

  \ are willing to take.
UNTRUSTWORTHY.description.1=Loyalty is just another tool to be used and discarded. {0}\
