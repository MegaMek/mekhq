ALTRUISTIC.label=Altruistic
ALTRUISTIC.description.0=Others come first - always. {0} willingly steps into danger to\
  \ protect {6} unit, gives up resources without hesitation, and never asks for anything in return.\
  \ Strength, in {6} eyes, is meant to shield, not to exploit.
ALTRUISTIC.description.1=No sacrifice is too great if it means saving others. {0} pushes\
  \ {4}self past exhaustion, taking the hardest missions and making the toughest calls, even when\
  \ no one asks {4} to. Eventually, {2} may give too much - leaving nothing of {4}self behind.
ALTRUISTIC.description.2=A firm believer in the greater good, {0} acts with a generosity\
  \ that others mistake for naivety. {5} willingness to help, even when it puts {4} at a\
  \ disadvantage, earns {4} both deep respect and ruthless exploitation from those less honorable.
ALTRUISTIC.description.3={0} doesn''t hesitate to put {4}self on the line for others. Whether\
  \ shielding an ally from harm, sharing {6} last supply cache, or standing up for those who can''t\
  \ fight for themselves, {2} {7, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} true strength is measured by how much\

  \ {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes} the weight of others'' burdens without complaint, ensuring that no\
  \ one suffers alone, even when it means carrying more than {2} should.
ALTRUISTIC.description.5={0}''s selflessness is both {6} greatest strength and {6} biggest\
  \ vulnerability. {1} {7, choice, 0#give|1#gives} without hesitation, {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ without expecting reward, and {7, choice, 0#sacrifice|1#sacrifices} without regret - sometimes\
  \ forgetting that even {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} limits.
ALTRUISTIC.ronin=I''m not looking for glory, and I''m not here for a payday. I''m here because I believe\
  \ strength isn''t about how much you can take - it''s about how much you can give.\
  <p>You know as well as I do that this line of work can grind people down. It makes you hard, selfish\
  \ - and that''s when things start to break. You need someone who''s willing to carry more than their\
  \ share of the weight, to take the hits so others don''t have to. That''s what I bring. I''m not afraid\
  \ to bleed for the unit. I''ve done it before, and I''ll do it again.</p>\

  <p>That''s why I''m useful. I don''t get attached, I don''t hesitate, and I don''t let emotion cloud my\
  \ judgment. I follow orders, I get the job done, and I don''t waste time worrying about the fallout.\
  \ You need someone who''ll keep their head when things get messy - someone who isn''t going to crack\

CALLOUS.label=Callous
CALLOUS.description.0={0} doesn''t get attached. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} suffering, loss, and\

  \ hesitate to make hard decisions, sacrifice allies, or eliminate threats with cold efficiency. In\

CALLOUS.description.5={0} has seen too much, lost too much, to care anymore. The only thing that\

CALLOUS.ronin=Compassion? Mercy? Those are luxuries you can''t afford when you''re trying to survive\
  \ out here.\
  \ <p>I''ve seen people hesitate because they cared too much - they didn''t last long. When the time\

CONDESCENDING.label=Condescending

CONDESCENDING.description.3={0} doesn''t argue - {2} {7, choice, 0#explain|1#explains}, as if talking\

CONSIDERATE.ronin=Most warriors are in it for the money, the thrill, or the glory - but I''ve seen\

  <p>I know the cost of every decision. When you send someone into the fire, someone else is left\

  \ others couldn''t stand. And I''ve watched too many good people get ground down by the weight of it\
  \ all. That''s why I''m different.</p>\
  <p>This isn''t about being soft - it''s about being smart. A strong unit isn''t just made up of\

ERRATIC.label=Erratic

ERRATIC.description.5=Trying to anticipate {0}''s next move is a waste of time. {1}\

EMPATHETIC.description.1={0} feels everything - the pain, the fear, the suffering of those\

EMPATHETIC.description.2={0}''s strength isn''t just in battle - it''s in people. {1}\

EMPATHETIC.description.5={0} has a rare gift: the ability to make others feel seen. Whether with a\

  \ that they are not alone in their struggles.
EMPATHETIC.ronin=I know how this works. Most warriors focus on the mission, the objectives, the kill\
  \ count. But people aren''t just assets or liabilities to me - they''re people. And I''m good at\
  \ understanding them.\
  <p>I don''t just follow orders and execute tactics. I see when morale''s slipping, when someone''s\
  \ fighting through pain, when someone''s about to break - and I step in before it happens. That''s\

  \ lasts longer.</p>\
  <p>I''m not saying I''ll win every fight. But I can make sure the people fighting alongside me are\

FRIENDLY.ronin=You know as well as I do that trust is what holds a unit together - and I''m good at\

NEGLECTFUL.label=Neglectful
NEGLECTFUL.description.0={0} doesn''t intentionally ignore responsibilities - {2} just\
  \ {7, choice, 0#get|1#gets} caught up in {6} own world. Whether it''s distractions, forgetfulness,\
  \ or a lack of organization, things tend to slip through the cracks more often than they should.
NEGLECTFUL.description.1={0} simply doesn''t care. Duties, relationships, and even {6} own\
  \ well-being are secondary to whatever {2} {7, choice, 0#deem|1#deems} important at the moment. If\
  \ something - or someone  - falls apart because of {6} inattention, that''s their problem, not {6}.
NEGLECTFUL.description.2=Keeping up with details isn''t a priority for {0}. {1} {7, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ the bare minimum to get by, leaving others to pick up the slack. Whether it''s out of laziness or\
  \ indifference, {2} rarely {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} through unless it directly benefits {4}.
NEGLECTFUL.description.3={0} has a habit of letting things slide - deadlines, promises, even basic\
  \ maintenance. {1} always {7, choice, 0#mean|1#means} to get around to it, but somehow, there''s\

NEGLECTFUL.description.4=Responsibility doesn''t sit well with {0}. Whether it''s managing a unit,\

  \ things fall apart and expects someone else to clean up the mess.
NEGLECTFUL.description.5={0} doesn''t check in, doesn''t follow up, and doesn''t worry about what\

  \ better yet, handled it themselves.
NEGLECTFUL.ronin=Look, , I might not be the most organized warrior you''ve got - I lose track of\

POMPOUS.description.3={0} doesn''t just think highly of {4}self - {2} {7, choice, 0#expect|1#expects}\

POMPOUS.ronin=Let me cut through the noise - I know exactly what I bring to the table, and so does\

PETTY.label=Petty
PETTY.description.0={0} never forgets a slight, no matter how small. Whether it''s a lost\

PETTY.description.1=Every insult, every disagreement, every minor inconvenience is a personal attack\

PETTY.description.2={0} never lets things go, but {2} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} always act on\
  \ it directly. Instead, {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} snide comments, "forgets" to relay important\
  \ information, and subtly undermines people in ways that are just deniable enough to avoid confrontation.
PETTY.description.3={0} doesn''t believe in taking the high road - not when the low road is so much\
  \ more satisfying. {1} {7, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} every slight, every insult, and every\

  \ the score.
PETTY.description.4={0}''s grudges are legendary. Whether it''s a minor disagreement or a perceived\

  \ creative ways to make sure people pay for them - often long after they''ve forgotten what they did.
PETTY.description.5={0}''s vengeance isn''t always loud, but it''s always calculated. A missing ration\
  \ pack, an inconvenient reassignment, a subtle but devastating rumor - {2} {7, choice, 0#play|1#plays}\
  \ the long game when it comes to payback, and {2} {7, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys} every second of it.
PETTY.ronin=Look, I''m not going to pretend to be the bigger person - because I''m not. If someone\
  \ crosses me, they''re going to feel it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow - but trust me, I''ve\
  \ got a long memory and a creative mind. I don''t let things slide, and I don''t forgive easily.\
  <p>But let''s be clear: that''s an asset. You want someone who''s got your back no matter what?\
  \ Someone who remembers who slighted the unit, who sabotaged a deal, who left you hanging when it\

PERSUASIVE.description.5={0} knows that persuasion isn''t just about words - it''s about presence. A\

  \ {7, choice, 0#want|1#wants}.
PERSUASIVE.ronin=You and I both know that wars aren''t just won on the battlefield - they''re won in\
  \ conversations, behind closed doors, in the spaces between words. That''s where I work best.\
  <p>Diplomatic negotiations, morale problems, even inter-unit disputes - I handle them. No shouting\

RECEPTIVE.ronin=There''s a reason the best tacticians aren''t the loudest voices in the room - they''re\
