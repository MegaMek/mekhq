ALTRUISTIC.label=Altruistic
ALTRUISTIC.description.0.regexp=Others come first - always. {0} willingly steps into danger to\
  \ protect {6} team, gives up resources without hesitation, and never asks for anything in return.\
  \ Strength, in {6} eyes, is meant to shield, not to exploit.
ALTRUISTIC.description.1.regexp=No sacrifice is too great if it means saving others. {0} pushes\
  \ {4}self past exhaustion, taking the hardest missions and making the toughest calls, even when\
  \ no one asks {4} to. Eventually, {2} may give too much - leaving nothing of {4}self behind.
ALTRUISTIC.description.2.regexp=A firm believer in the greater good, {0} acts with a generosity\
  \ that others mistake for naivety. {5} willingness to help, even when it puts {4} at a\
  \ disadvantage, earns {4} both deep respect and ruthless exploitation from those less honorable.

APATHETIC.label=Apathetic
APATHETIC.description.0.regexp=Nothing really excites {0}, and nothing really bothers {4} either.\
  \ {1} does {6} job, follows orders, and goes through the motions, but there's no passion behind it\
  \ - just routine.
APATHETIC.description.1.regexp=After seeing too much death and betrayal, {0} has stopped caring.\
  \ {1} doesn't form attachments, doesn't believe in causes, and doesn't waste energy on emotions.\
  \ In {6} mind, caring only leads to pain.
APATHETIC.description.2.regexp=The universe is broken, and {0} knows it. {1} doesn't get involved\
  \ in arguments, doesn't waste time on idealism, and certainly doesn't stick {6} neck out for\
  \ anyone. As far as {2}'s concerned, nothing really matters in the long run.

AUTHENTIC.label=Authentic
AUTHENTIC.description.0.regexp={0} doesn't pretend to be something {2}'s not. {1} speaks {6} mind,\
  \ stays true to {6} beliefs, and refuses to put on a mask just to impress others. What you see is\
  \ exactly what you get.
AUTHENTIC.description.1.regexp=No sugarcoating, no empty promises - {0} tells it like it is,\
  \ whether people want to hear it or not. {1} refuses to play politics or pretend to be something\
  \ {2} isn't, even if it makes {4} enemies.
AUTHENTIC.description.2.regexp=People trust {0} because {2}'s real. {1} doesn't fake emotions,\
  \ doesn't manipulate, and doesn't care about putting on an act. {5} honesty may be blunt at\
  \ times, but it makes {4} both respected and reliable.

BLUNT.label=Blunt
BLUNT.description.0.regexp={0} says exactly what's on {6} mind, with no concern for sugarcoating\
  \ or social niceties. If the truth is harsh, so be it - {2} sees no point in dressing it up.
BLUNT.description.1.regexp=There's no room for pleasantries in {0}'s world. {1} delivers the hard\
  \ truths, whether people can handle them or not, cutting through delusion with words as sharp as\
  \ a blade. If someone's weak, incompetent, or making a mistake, {2} makes sure they know it.
BLUNT.description.2.regexp=While others waste time with diplomacy, {0} gets straight to the\
  \ point. {1} values efficiency over politeness and doesn't believe in dancing around the truth.\
  \ Some find {6} approach refreshing - others just find it frustrating.

CALLOUS.label=Callous
CALLOUS.description.0.regexp={0} doesn't get attached. {1} sees suffering, loss, and hardship, but\
  \ none of it seems to affect {4}. Whether it's a defense mechanism or just who {2} is, {2} keeps\
  \ {6} emotions locked away and moves forward without hesitation.
CALLOUS.description.1.regexp=Compassion is a weakness {0} can't afford. {1} doesn't hesitate to\
  \ make hard decisions, sacrifice allies, or eliminate threats with cold efficiency. In {6} mind,\
  \ survival means shutting out anything that might make {4} hesitate.
CALLOUS.description.2.regexp={0} believes in results, not feelings. {1} dismisses emotions as\
  \ distractions and refuses to waste time comforting others. To {4}, facts, logic, and action\
  \ matter - sympathy does not.

COMPASSIONATE.label=Compassionate
COMPASSIONATE.description.0.regexp={0} genuinely cares about the people around {4}. {1} looks out\
  \ for {6} team, helps those in need, and does what {2} can to make life a little less cruel - even\
  \ in a universe that doesn't reward kindness.
COMPASSIONATE.description.1.regexp=Caring is a curse {0} can't shake. {1} feels the weight of\
  \ every loss, every sacrifice, and every person {2} couldn't save. No matter how much it hurts, {2}\
  \ refuses to stop trying - because if {2} does, {2}'s no better than the monsters {2} fights.
COMPASSIONATE.description.2.regexp={0}'s compassion isn't just a trait - it's {6} strength. {5}\
  \ ability to see the good in people, to uplift those around {4}, and to fight not just for\
  \ {4}self, but for others, makes {4} a leader that people want to follow.

CONDESCENDING.label=Condescending
CONDESCENDING.description.0.regexp={0} talks to people like they're always a step behind {4} -\
  \ because in {6} mind, they usually are. {1} assumes {2} knows best, rarely listens to advice, and\
  \ has little patience for those who can't keep up.
CONDESCENDING.description.1.regexp={0} doesn't just look down on others - {2} barely acknowledges\
  \ them. {1} sees most people as incompetent, useless, or beneath {4}, and {2} makes no effort to\
  \ hide {6} disdain. If someone disagrees with {4}, {2} assumes they're simply too stupid to\
  \ understand.
CONDESCENDING.description.2.regexp={0} always has a smug remark loaded, making it painfully clear\
  \ {2} thinks {2}'s the smartest person in the room. Whether through subtle jabs or outright\
  \ mockery, {2} has a way of making others feel small without ever raising {6} voice.

CONSIDERATE.label=Considerate
CONSIDERATE.description.0.regexp={0} always takes the time to think about how {6} actions affect\
  \ others. Whether it's checking in on {6} teammates, giving credit where it's due, or offering\
  \ help without being asked, {2} makes sure people feel valued and respected.
CONSIDERATE.description.1.regexp=In a ruthless world, {0} refuses to become another heartless\
  \ soldier. {1} watches out for those who can't protect themselves, even when it costs {4}. The\
  \ weight of every choice lingers in {6} mind, but {2}'d rather carry it than let others suffer.
CONSIDERATE.description.2.regexp={0} isn't loud about {6} kindness, but it's there. A quiet word\
  \ of encouragement, a favor done without asking for thanks, or a small sacrifice to make\
  \ someone's life easier - {2} pays attention to what people need and acts on it, whether they notice\
  \ or not.

DISINGENUOUS.label=Disingenuous
DISINGENUOUS.description.0.regexp={0} knows exactly what to say to get people on {6} side, but\
  \ {6} words rarely match {6} true intentions. {1} smiles, flatters, and makes promises, but\
  \ beneath it all, {2}'s only looking out for {4}self.
DISINGENUOUS.description.1.regexp=Every word {0} speaks is calculated. {1} twists the truth, plays\
  \ people against each other, and pretends to care just enough to gain trust before using it to\
  \ {6} advantage. If someone thinks {2}'s being sincere, they're already {6} next victim.
DISINGENUOUS.description.2.regexp={0} never gives a straight answer. {1} dodges questions, avoids\
  \ commitments, and keeps people guessing about where {2} really stands. It's not outright lying -\
  \ it's just never letting anyone get close enough to see the truth.

DISMISSIVE.label=Dismissive
DISMISSIVE.description.0.regexp={0} doesn't waste time on people or ideas {2} deems unimportant.\
  \ If {2} thinks someone's opinion is useless, {2} brushes them off without a second thought and\
  \ moves forward on {6} own terms.
DISMISSIVE.description.1.regexp={0} has seen too much to care about petty concerns. {1} ignores\
  \ emotions, disregards complaints, and barely acknowledges those {2} considers beneath {4}. If\
  \ someone isn't immediately useful, they might as well not exist.
DISMISSIVE.description.2.regexp={0} rarely takes others seriously, rolling {6} eyes at concerns\
  \ {2} doesn't find valid. Whether it's a risky plan, a personal grievance, or a suggestion {2}\
  \ thinks is dumb, {2} shuts it down with a snide remark and moves on.

ENCOURAGING.label=Encouraging
ENCOURAGING.description.0.regexp={0} believes in {6} team and makes sure they know it. Whether\
  \ it's a few words of confidence before a mission or lifting someone up after a failure, {2}\
  \ always pushes others to be their best.
ENCOURAGING.description.1.regexp={0} doesn't coddle - {2} drives people forward. {5} words are\
  \ sharp, {6} expectations high, but it's all to make sure those around {4} survive. If {2}'s hard\
  \ on someone, it's because {2} refuses to let them fail.
ENCOURAGING.description.2.regexp={0}'s energy is contagious. {1} has a way of making even the\
  \ worst situations seem manageable, keeping morale high with a well-timed joke, an inspiring\
  \ speech, or a simple "You've got this."

ERRATIC.label=Erratic
ERRATIC.description.0.regexp={0}'s actions rarely follow a clear pattern. One moment, {2}'s\
  \ cautious and methodical; the next, {2}'s diving headfirst into chaos. {5} unpredictability keeps\
  \ enemies - and sometimes allies - on edge.
ERRATIC.description.1.regexp=There's no telling what {0} will do next, and that's what makes {4}\
  \ dangerous. {5} moods swing wildly, {6} plans shift without warning, and {6} reactions can be as\
  \ destructive to {6} allies as they are to {6} enemies.
ERRATIC.description.2.regexp={0} thrives on spontaneity, making split-second decisions that seem\
  \ reckless - until they somehow work. {1}'s impossible to predict, always thinking three steps ahead\
  \ in ways that make no sense to anyone but {4}.

EMPATHETIC.label=Empathetic
EMPATHETIC.description.0.regexp={0} has a natural ability to sense what others are feeling. {1}\
  \ listens without judgment, offers genuine support, and always seems to know exactly what someone\
  \ needs to hear - whether they realize it or not.
EMPATHETIC.description.1.regexp={0} feels everything - the pain, the fear, the suffering of those\
  \ around {4}. It weighs on {4}, but {2} refuses to turn away, even when caring too much becomes a\
  \ liability in a universe that rewards cruelty.
EMPATHETIC.description.2.regexp={0}'s strength isn't just in battle - it's in people. {1} connects\
  \ with others effortlessly, making them feel heard, valued, and understood. Whether leading a\
  \ team or comforting a friend, {6} empathy draws others to {4}.

FRIENDLY.label=Friendly

  \ conversation effortlessly, and genuinely enjoys getting to know people. Whether ally or\
  \ stranger, {2} treats everyone with kindness and respect.
FRIENDLY.description.1.regexp={0} puts on a friendly face, but it's a survival tactic as much as\
  \ anything. {1} knows being likable keeps people from turning on {4}, but deep down, {2}'s always\
  \ waiting for the moment when trust becomes a liability.
FRIENDLY.description.2.regexp={0} can talk to anyone and make them feel like an old friend. {5}\
  \ charm, humor, and ability to find common ground make {4} the kind of person others naturally\
  \ gravitate toward, whether {2}'s leading a team or sharing a drink.

GREGARIOUS.label=Gregarious
GREGARIOUS.description.0.regexp=No room stays quiet for long when {0} is around. {1} thrives on\
  \ conversation, easily making connections and ensuring that no one feels left out. Whether in a\
  \ warzone or a bar, {2} makes {4}self at home among people.
GREGARIOUS.description.1.regexp=Laughter and stories are {6} armor. {0} keeps the energy high and\
  \ the conversation flowing, but beneath the charm, there's a deep need to drown out the silence -\
  \ the kind that brings back ghosts best left forgotten.
GREGARIOUS.description.2.regexp=Crowds fuel {4}. {0} enjoys the spotlight, telling the best\
  \ stories, leading the wildest celebrations, and making sure everyone is having a good time. If\
  \ there's action, {2}'s in the middle of it, keeping the momentum alive.

INSPIRING.label=Inspiring

  \ confidence, determination, and unwavering presence push others to go beyond their limits,\
  \ knowing that if {2}'s leading, victory feels possible.
INSPIRING.description.1.regexp=In a brutal world where hope is a rare commodity, {0} refuses to\
  \ let it die. Even when everything is crumbling, {6} words, actions, and sheer force of will\
  \ remind others that there's still something worth fighting for.
INSPIRING.description.2.regexp={0} doesn't just lead - {2} elevates those around {4}. Whether it's a\
  \ rousing speech before battle, a quiet word of encouragement, or leading by example, {2} makes\
  \ people feel like they can accomplish the impossible.

INDIFFERENT.label=Indifferent
INDIFFERENT.description.0.regexp={0} doesn't get involved unless {2} has to. Other people's\
  \ problems, moral dilemmas, or even the bigger picture don't concern {4} - {2} focuses on what\
  \ directly affects {4} and ignores the rest.
INDIFFERENT.description.1.regexp=Nothing moves {4} anymore. Loss, suffering, and chaos are just\
  \ background noise, and {2} doesn't waste energy pretending to care. Whether someone lives or\
  \ dies, wins or loses - it's all the same in the end.
INDIFFERENT.description.2.regexp={0} isn't cruel, but {2} doesn't see the point in getting\
  \ emotionally invested. {1} makes decisions based on logic, not feelings, and while others may\
  \ take things personally, {2} simply shrugs and moves on.

INTROVERTED.label=Introverted
INTROVERTED.description.0.regexp={0} prefers to observe rather than dominate a conversation. {1}\
  \ speaks when necessary, keeps {6} thoughts to {4}self, and tends to recharge best when {2}'s\
  \ alone rather than in a crowd.
INTROVERTED.description.1.regexp=People exhaust {4}, and trust is a luxury {2} can't afford. {0}\
  \ keeps {6} distance, avoids unnecessary interactions, and only engages when absolutely\
  \ necessary. Solitude isn't just a preference - it's survival.
INTROVERTED.description.2.regexp=While {2} doesn't seek attention, {0} notices everything. {1}\
  \ listens more than {2} speaks, analyzes before {2} acts, and values deep conversations over\
  \ shallow chatter. {5} quiet nature makes {6} words all the more impactful when {2} chooses to\
  \ share them.

IRRITABLE.label=Irritable
IRRITABLE.description.0.regexp={0} has little patience for incompetence, delays, or pointless\
  \ chatter. {1} gets frustrated easily, especially when things aren't going according to plan, and\
  \ doesn't bother hiding {6} annoyance.
IRRITABLE.description.1.regexp=Everything grates on {4} - people, orders, even the sound of {6} own\
  \ comms. {0} is always on edge, snapping at allies and enemies alike. Whether it's stress,\
  \ trauma, or just who {2} is, {6} temper is a fuse ready to blow.
IRRITABLE.description.2.regexp={0} is the guy who sighs loudly when someone asks a dumb\
  \ question. {1} rolls {6} eyes, mutters under {6} breath, and gets annoyed over small things - but\
  \ beneath the grumbling, {2} still gets the job done.

NARCISSISTIC.label=Narcissistic
NARCISSISTIC.description.0.regexp={0} believes {2}'s the smartest, strongest, and most important\
  \ person in the room. {1} craves attention, thrives on admiration, and makes sure everyone knows\
  \ just how exceptional {2} is.
NARCISSISTIC.description.1.regexp=Everything revolves around {4} - at least, that's how {2} sees it.\
  \ {0} uses people for {6} own gain, dismisses anyone who doesn't serve {6} interests, and\
  \ considers loyalty a one-way street where {2}'s always at the top.
NARCISSISTIC.description.2.regexp={0} loves the spotlight and works hard to stay in it. {1}\
  \ boasts, exaggerates, and makes sure {6} victories are as public as possible. While {6} ego can\
  \ be exhausting, {6} charm and sheer confidence make it hard to completely dislike {4}.

NEGLECTFUL.label=Neglectful
NEGLECTFUL.description.0.regexp={0} doesn't intentionally ignore responsibilities - {2} just gets\
  \ caught up in {6} own world. Whether it's distractions, forgetfulness, or a lack of\
  \ organization, things tend to slip through the cracks more often than they should.
NEGLECTFUL.description.1.regexp={0} simply doesn't care. Duties, relationships, and even {6} own\
  \ well-being are secondary to whatever {2} deems important at the moment. If something - or someone\
  \ - falls apart because of {6} inattention, that's their problem, not {6}.
NEGLECTFUL.description.2.regexp=Keeping up with details isn't a priority for {0}. {1} does the\
  \ bare minimum to get by, leaving others to pick up the slack. Whether it's out of laziness or\
  \ indifference, {2} rarely follows through unless it directly benefits {4}.

POMPOUS.label=Pompous
POMPOUS.description.0.regexp={0} carries {4}self with exaggerated confidence, talking up {6}\
  \ achievements and acting as if {2}'s the best pilot, strategist, and leader in the Inner Sphere.\
  \ While {6} boasting can be exhausting, there's just enough charm behind it to make it\
  \ entertaining.
POMPOUS.description.1.regexp={0} sees {4}self as superior to everyone around {4}. {1} looks down\
  \ on others, dismisses their opinions, and expects recognition for {6} so-called brilliance. If\
  \ someone questions {4}, they're met with condescension at best - or outright hostility at worst.
POMPOUS.description.2.regexp={0} loves the sound of {6} own voice, spending more time talking\
  \ about {6} greatness than actually proving it. {1} overcomplicates simple ideas, inserts {4}self\
  \ into situations just to show off, and acts as if every decision {2} makes is revolutionary - even\
  \ when it's not.

PETTY.label=Petty
PETTY.description.0.regexp={0} never forgets a slight, no matter how small. Whether it's a lost\
  \ bet, a sarcastic remark, or someone taking {6} favorite seat, {2} finds ways to get back at\
  \ people - usually with just enough humor to keep it from being outright malicious.
PETTY.description.1.regexp=Every insult, every disagreement, every minor inconvenience is a\
  \ personal attack in {0}'s mind. {1} holds grudges for years, going out of {6} way to make sure\
  \ anyone who crosses {4} regrets it, even if it costs {4} more than it's worth.
PETTY.description.2.regexp={0} never lets things go, but {2} doesn't always act on it directly.\
  \ Instead, {2} makes snide comments, "forgets" to relay important information, and subtly\
  \ undermines people in ways that are just deniable enough to avoid confrontation.

PERSUASIVE.label=Persuasive
PERSUASIVE.description.0.regexp={0} has a way with words, effortlessly swaying people to {6}\
  \ side. Whether {2}'s negotiating a deal, rallying a team, or talking {6} way out of trouble, {6}\

PERSUASIVE.description.1.regexp=Persuasion is just another tool for control. {0} knows exactly\
  \ how to twist words, play on emotions, and push people into doing what {2} wants - whether they\
  \ realize it or not. By the time they see the trap, it's already too late.
PERSUASIVE.description.2.regexp={0} doesn't pressure people - {2} makes them think they're making\
  \ their own choices. {5} calm demeanor, well-placed words, and ability to read a situation let\
  \ {4} guide conversations where {2} wants them to go, without anyone realizing they've been led.

RECEPTIVE.label=Receptive
RECEPTIVE.description.0.regexp={0} listens before {2} speaks, always considering different\
  \ perspectives before making decisions. {1} values input from others and is quick to adapt when\
  \ presented with new information.

  \ weaknesses, and orchestrates events from the shadows, ensuring that by the time anyone realizes\
  \ they've been played, {2}'s already won.
SCHEMING.description.2.regexp={0} enjoys working the angles, setting up small tricks and clever\
  \ deceptions just to see how people react. Whether it's a battlefield feint or a harmless prank,\
  \ {2} finds joy in outthinking and outmaneuvering those around {4}.

SINCERE.label=Sincere
SINCERE.description.0.regexp={0} says what {2} means and means what {2} says. {1} doesn't believe in\
  \ playing games or sugarcoating the truth - {6} words and actions come from a place of honesty,\
  \ making {4} a rare presence in a world full of deception.
SINCERE.description.1.regexp=In a universe built on lies and betrayals, {0} refuses to become\
  \ just another manipulator. {1} holds onto {6} integrity, even when it costs {4}, because {2} knows\
  \ that if {2} loses that, {2}'s lost everything.
SINCERE.description.2.regexp=People trust {0} because they know {2}'s real. {1} doesn't put on a\
  \ facade or tell people what they want to hear - {2} tells them what they need to hear. {5}\
  \ sincerity makes {4} a reliable friend and an unwavering ally.

SUPPORTIVE.label=Supportive
SUPPORTIVE.description.0.regexp={0} always has people's backs. Whether it's offering words of\
  \ encouragement, stepping in when someone's struggling, or making sure {6} team feels valued,\
  \ {2}'s the kind of person others can always count on.
SUPPORTIVE.description.1.regexp=No matter the cost, {0} refuses to let {6} allies fall. {1} pushes\
  \ {4}self to exhaustion, takes risks no one else will, and puts others before {4}self - even when\
  \ it means {2}'s the one left bleeding.
SUPPORTIVE.description.2.regexp={0} isn't loud about {6} support, but it's always there. A nod at\
  \ the right time, an unspoken gesture of help, or simply being present when it matters - {6}\

  \ pressured. {1} can steer conversations, soften harsh truths, and get {6} way without anyone\
  \ realizing they've been guided exactly where {2} wants them to go.

UNTRUSTWORTHY.label=Untrustworthy
UNTRUSTWORTHY.description.0.regexp={0} has a reputation for bending the truth, cutting corners,\
  \ and looking out for {4}self first. {1}'s likable, sure, but trusting {4}? That's a gamble few\
  \ are willing to take.
UNTRUSTWORTHY.description.1.regexp=Loyalty is just another tool to be used and discarded. {0}\
  \ lies, betrays, and manipulates without hesitation, making promises {2} never intends to keep. If\
  \ someone still trusts {4}, it's only because they haven't been burned yet.
UNTRUSTWORTHY.description.2.regexp={0} always has an excuse, a clever explanation, or a way to\
  \ shift blame. {1} might sound sincere, but when push comes to shove, {2}'ll disappear, take the\
  \ better offer, or leave others holding the bag.
