  Certain Life Paths require the character to possess a minimum rank in an associated Skill Attribute. Such as \
  Connections, or Property. The character is not required to meet those requirements until the end of character \
  creation.\
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Selection</h2>\
  You only need to change the requirements for those Traits you wish to be associated with your Life Path. All other \
  Traits can be left with the default values.
