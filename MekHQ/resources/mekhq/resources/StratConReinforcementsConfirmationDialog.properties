StratConReinforcementsConfirmationDialog.inCharacter.transport={0}, I''ve had the computer break down our likelihood \
  of success.\
  <p>We really should hire a specialist for this kind of thing...</p>
StratConReinforcementsConfirmationDialog.inCharacter.tactical={0}, I''ve run the numbers. If we reinforce now, here''s \
  our likelihood of success:
StratConReinforcementsConfirmationDialog.inCharacter.supportPoints=Support Points:
StratConReinforcementsConfirmationDialog.inCharacter.total=<br><br><b>Target Number:</b> {0}
StratConReinforcementsConfirmationDialog.outOfCharacter.transport=Having an <b>Intelligence Analyst</b>, <b>Military \
  Analyst</b>, <b>Military Theorist</b>, or <b>Tactical Analyst</b> employed by the unit will give more reliable \
  results (this is an RP effect only).\
  <p>Reinforcing costs 1 <a href='GLOSSARY:SUPPORT_POINTS'>Support Point</a> and a check using the above <b>Target \
  Number</b>. If the check is failed your reinforcements may be <b>Intercepted</b>! If an Interception attempt is \
  made, the commander of your reinforcements will need to make a <b>Tactics</b> skill check to evade the \
  interception.</p>\
  <p>You can improve the chances your attempt succeeds by changing the reinforcing unit to the Auxiliary or Maneuver \
  <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_ROLES'>Combat Roles</a>. Or by paying additional <b>Support Points</b>. Each additional \
  Support Point spent reduces the Target Number by 2.</p>\
  <p>If the situation is truly dire, you can choose to <b>Reinforce Instantly</b>. This doubles all <b>Support \
  Points</b> paid and may take you into negative Support Points.</p>\
  <p>If reinforcing using an option marked '(GM)' the reinforcement attempt is both free and automatically \
  succeeds.</p>
