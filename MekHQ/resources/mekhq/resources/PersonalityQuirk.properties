ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.label=Constantly Adjusting Clothes
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT=Every strap, every buckle, every seal - {0} checks them all,\
  \ again and again. {5} battle gear is adjusted with the same precision no matter the circumstance.\
  \ {1} {9, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it''s discipline, but in truth, it''s a ritual to calm {6} nerves.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never feels quite right in {6} gear, always tugging at a\
  \ strap or shifting {6} gloves even mid-skirmish. To {6} {8}, it''s just a quirk, but those\
  \ who''ve fought beside {4} long enough know: {0} is always waiting for disaster. Maybe it''s\
  \ because {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many comrades get vaped by a laser, or maybe it''s just\
  \ instinct. Either way, when {0} starts adjusting {6} gear a little too often, it''s time to take\
  \ cover.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT={5} gear never fits right. {5} pistol holster is always too\
  \ tight or too loose. {5} boots rub raw against {6} heels. It doesn''t matter what uniform {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#wear|1#wears} or what battlefield {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} dropped into - {0}\
  \ will never be comfortable. Some say {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} fidgety. Others think {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ just waiting for the day {2} won''t need to adjust anything ever again. Because dead men don''t need\
  \ to fix their collars.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} insists that every uniform, flight suit, and cooling vest\
  \ is properly fitted before deployment. If {2} {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} a tech in a grease-stained\
  \ jumpsuit with an undone collar, they''ll get an earful - because a ragged warrior is a careless one,\
  \ and carelessness gets people killed.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.SUPPORT=Between adjusting {6} sleeves and straightening {6} belt, {0}\
  \ runs things with unsettling speed. {1} can load a DropShip in record time while never once\
  \ standing still. Some think {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just high-strung, but the company keeps running\
  \ because of {4}.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} believes if everything is in its place - uniforms pressed,\
  \ boots polished, reports properly filed - maybe, just maybe, fate won''t notice {4}. But in a\
  \ military unit, paperwork means nothing when a JumpShip goes missing, or when the employer\

AFFECTIONATE.label=Overly Affectionate

  \ squeeze.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.COMBATANT=In the modern military, most people keep their distance - losing\
  \ friends is inevitable. Not {0}. {1} {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} every name, every fallen\

AFFECTIONATE.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s always there, hand on your shoulder, telling you that\

  \ that tight, lingering hug before deployment... well, you better hope {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ wrong.
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} runs things like a family dinner table, always checking if\
  \ you''ve eaten, gotten enough rest, and if you''re warm enough. {1} {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} out\
  \ coffee with a reassuring pat on the back and calls the greenest recruits ''kiddo'' regardless of\
  \ their age. Even the grizzled veterans can''t stay mad at {4} for long.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} means well, but {6} tendency to clap people on the back,\
  \ sling an arm over their shoulders, or hug them when they least expect it has led to more than\
  \ one awkward moment. {5} warmth is rare, but let''s be real - there''s a reason HR gave {4} another\
  \ warning after that last Christmas party.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} makes sure everyone feels wanted, needed, remembered. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#laugh|1#laughs} with the fresh-faced recruits, {9, choice, 0#give|1#gives} the\
  \ Techs a warm shoulder squeeze after a long shift, and never {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} a MekWarrior\
  \ leave without a genuine, "Be safe, okay?" But in this line of work, people disappear - sometimes\

  \ {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} grieving.

APOLOGETIC.label=Overly Apologetic
APOLOGETIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is a competent warrior, but you''d never know it from the\
  \ way {2} {9, choice, 0#apologize|1#apologizes} after every shot. Missed a target? "Sorry about that."\
  \ Nailed a headshot? "Hope that wasn''t too brutal." Even enemy pilots getting cored out by {6}\
  \ autocannon might hear a muttered "Didn''t mean for it to go that way..." over comms.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.COMBATANT=No matter where {2} {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}, {0} can''t stop\
  \ apologizing. {1}''ll say "Sorry" for calling a warning too late, for calling it too early, for\
  \ asking a question, and sometimes just for existing. {1} {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} hard, but\
  \ {6} {8} suspects {2}''d apologize to an inbound PPC if given the chance.
APOLOGETIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} says "Sorry" like a prayer. {1} {9, choice, 0#apologize|1#apologizes}\
  \ to the comrades {2} couldn''t save, to the enemies {2} had to kill, and to {4}self for believing the\
  \ fighting would ever end. Maybe {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} already dead inside, or maybe\
  \ {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just waiting for the battlefield to make it official. Either way, when\
  \ {0} starts whispering apologies mid-skirmish, it''s a bad omen.
APOLOGETIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Need ammo? "Sorry it took so long." Ration packs taste like\
  \ cardboard? "I''m really sorry about that." DropShip delayed by pirate activity? "Wish I could\
  \ fix it, truly." {0} apologizes for things that aren''t {6} fault, but {6} relentless\
  \ politeness means people rarely yell at {4} - at least, not for long.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} is good at {6} job, but {2}''ll never admit it. No matter how\
  \ well {2} {9, choice, 0#manage|1#manages} things, {2} {9, choice, 0#act|1#acts} like a single misstep\
  \ could doom the entire unit. {1}''ll triple-check orders, then apologize for bothering people about\
  \ them. If you thank {4}, {2}''ll probably just say, "Oh, it wasn''t much, really. Sorry if it was."
APOLOGETIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Military life is brutal, and when things go wrong, someone has to\
  \ take the fall. {0}, somehow, always ends up volunteering. A shipment lost to raiders? "I\
  \ should''ve arranged better security." A contract gone bad? "I should''ve checked the fine print."\
  \ Even when it''s not {6} fault, {0} takes the weight of the unit''s sins - and sooner or later,\
  \ the universe will demand payment.

BOOKWORM.label=Always Reading
BOOKWORM.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s never without a datapad, whether it''s field manuals,\
  \ After-Action Reports, or ancient texts on combined-arms strategy. {1} {9, choice, 0#absorb|1#absorbs}\
  \ tactics like a sponge, always searching for an edge. If you see {4} flipping through a history\

  \ maneuver that saved some long-dead general''s skin.
BOOKWORM.description.1.COMBATANT=Between battles, {0}''s nose is buried in a book - anything from\
  \ war poetry to pre-spaceflight philosophy. {1} {9, choice, 0#hope|1#hopes} it helps {4} make sense\
  \ of the chaos, but {6} {8} worries when {2} {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} quoting lines about fate\
  \ and inevitability right before a drop. The last thing you want to hear before a skirmish is\
  \ someone musing about existential doom.
BOOKWORM.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps a small, battered notebook tucked inside {6} vest.\
  \ It isn''t a journal, and it isn''t for poetry. It''s a list of names - every comrade {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ lost, every enemy {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} killed, every contract that ended in blood. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#read|1#reads} it every night, whispering each name like a mantra. One day, {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}, someone else will be reading {6}.
BOOKWORM.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can fix a supply chain issue in minutes, negotiate a\
  \ contract loophole, and recite the complete corporate history of the Inner Sphere - mostly because\
  \ {2} {9, choice, 0#read|1#reads} everything. Need a regulation cited or an obscure planetary fact?\
  \ {0}''s already flipping to the right page.
BOOKWORM.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s always reading, but the problem is when. Mid-conversation?\
  \ Eyes still on a book. Being addressed by the commander? "Yeah, yeah, one sec." {1}''ll draft an\
  \ action plan while reading an old science-fiction novel and still do a better job than anyone\
  \ else, but it''s an open question if {2} even {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} what planet\
  \ {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} on half the time.
BOOKWORM.description.2.SUPPORT={0} reads because {2} {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} to. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#study|1#studies} ancient Terran records, disaster reports, the economic collapses\
  \ of entire planets. {1} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} it''s to learn from the past, but deep down, {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} the truth - history doesn''t repeat, it rhymes. And in this\

CALENDAR.label=Keeps a Personal Calendar
CALENDAR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has every mission, training session, and equipment check\
  \ meticulously scheduled. {1} even {9, choice, 0#set|1#sets} reminders for "Check Ammo Reserves" and\

  \ never the one caught off-guard when an op gets moved up at the last minute.
CALENDAR.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s calendar isn''t just for logistics; it''s full of birthdays,\
  \ contract anniversaries, and even the day {2} first met each member of {6} {8}. {1} {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes}\
  \ sure to slip a small gift or a kind word to comrades on their special days. Some find it endearing,\
  \ others unsettling - because in this line of work, remembering dates also means remembering who\
  \ didn''t make it to the next one.
CALENDAR.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s calendar is obsessive. {1} {9, choice, 0#log|1#logs} every\
  \ mission, every deployment, every injury. {1} {9, choice, 0#track|1#tracks} trends - how long the\
  \ average warrior lasts in the unit; how many more battles {6} {8} can take before the odds catch\
  \ up. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen the numbers, and {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}. There''s a date\

CALENDAR.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s calendar isn''t just personal - it''s the real company\
  \ schedule. Payroll deadlines, JumpShip departures, contract negotiations - {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ got it all mapped out. If the commander wants to know when they''re leaving, they don''t ask the XO.\
  \ They ask {0}.
CALENDAR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} believes mercenary life shouldn''t be all death and logistics,\
  \ so {2} {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure to schedule "Company Movie Night," "Optional Poker\
  \ Tournament," and "Morale-Boosting Happy Hour." Even the gruffest veterans roll their eyes at first\
  \ - until they find themselves actually looking forward to "Trivia Night, Hegemony Edition."
CALENDAR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps a calendar because someone has to. It tells {4} exactly\
  \ when the company''s bank account will run dry, when their ''Meks will finally wear out, and when\

CANDLES.label=Fond of Scented Candles
CANDLES.description.0.COMBATANT=The repair bays stink of sweat and burnt wiring, the barracks\
  \ always reek of gun oil, and the battlefield is worse. {0} fights the stink of war with an\
  \ arsenal of lavender, sandalwood, and citrus candles. {5} squadmates mock {4} - until they realize\
  \ {6} bunk actually smells nice.
CANDLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, {0} lights a small candle in {6}\
  \ quarters or in the corner of a DropShip hangar. It''s always the same scent, something that\
  \ reminds {4} of home - wherever that was. {1} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} talk about it, but\
  \ those who''ve fought beside {4} know: it''s not just a habit. It''s a tether, a way to remind {4}self\
  \ there''s still a world beyond the blood and steel.
CANDLES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to share a tent, a bunk, or a barracks with someone\
  \ who loved scented candles. They''re gone now, but their habit remains. Every time {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#light|1#lights} one, the memory lingers in the air like the smoke curling from the\
  \ wick - fading, but never truly gone.
CANDLES.description.0.SUPPORT=The company barracks are cold, impersonal, and smell like old\
  \ metal - but not {0}''s office. {5} desk is lined with small candles, filling the air with warm\
  \ vanilla, crisp pine, or exotic spices from some world {2} barely {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}.\
  \ Even the grizzled veterans find themselves stopping by just to breathe for a moment.
CANDLES.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s love for scented candles has nearly gotten {4} banned\
  \ from multiple compounds. Between fire suppression alarms going off and that one time a candle\
  \ nearly ignited a munitions crate, {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been forced to compromise. Now {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} to flameless aromatherapy diffusers - but deep down, {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it''s not the same.
CANDLES.description.2.SUPPORT=The scent of blood, burning cities, and melted armor haunt\
  \ {0}''s memories. {1} learned long ago that no amount of scrubbing can erase the past. But a \
  candle - one simple, flickering light - can mask it for just a little while. And when the wax burns\
  \ down to nothing, {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} it''s time to light another.

CHEWING_GUM.label=Always Chewing Gum
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions shake the ground, autocannon fire rips through\

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.label=Over-the-Top Greetings
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it''s a battlefield check-in or a casual\

FORMAL_SPEECH.label=Overly Formal Speech
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT={0} delivers battlefield reports like {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT={0} insists on addressing even {6} closest comrades as\
  \ "Lieutenant," "Sergeant," or "esteemed colleague." No one knows if it''s a quirk, a joke, or if\
  \ {2} actually {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} they''re all attending a formal gala instead of wading\
  \ through battlefield wreckage. Either way, it makes war sound bizarrely polite.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT={0} speaks like someone out of time, using words and phrases\
  \ that no one has in years. Maybe it''s because {2} came from somewhere refined. Maybe it''s a\

FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s supply reports don''t just list numbers - they tell a\

FURNITURE.label=Constantly Rearranges Furniture

FURNITURE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is incapable of leaving a room alone. The storage crates?\
  \ Better flow if they''re stacked this way. The command center? Desks should be closer for\

  \ The crew walks in every morning never knowing what new layout {0} has cooked up.
FURNITURE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop tweaking the company''s base layout. "This would\

  \ DropShip cargo hold - {0} will optimize it, even if it means driving everyone insane.
FURNITURE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} moves furniture, gear, everything - not because it matters,\

  \ if they can still feel their fingers afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s handshake is a statement, even when it really shouldn''t\

HISTORIAN.description.0.SUPPORT=A simple request for replacement heat sinks can turn into a\

HISTORIAN.description.1.SUPPORT=Somewhere in {0}''s personal storage are old reports, battlefield\

HUMMER.label=Habitual Hummer
HUMMER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is always humming - sometimes a marching cadence, sometimes\
  \ an old bar song, sometimes a melody no one else recognizes. It''s not loud, just a quiet hum\
  \ over comms while {2} {9, choice, 0#line|1#lines} up a shot or waits for the next engagement. {5}\
  \ {8} jokes that if {2} ever {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} humming, that''s when things have really\
  \ gone bad.
HUMMER.description.1.COMBATANT=In the middle of a skirmish, with missiles flying and alarms\
  \ blaring, {0} is still humming. {1} {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it when charging, when bracing for\
  \ impact, even while dodging incoming fire. Some say it helps {4} focus. Others think\
  \ {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} just a little too comfortable in the chaos. Either way, the tune never\
  \ stops - until the shooting does.
HUMMER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} hums to fill the silence where voices used to be. The\
  \ comrades who didn''t make it back, the allies lost on distant battlefields, the old commanders\
  \ who once barked orders over the radio. If {2} {9, choice, 0#hum|1#hums} loud enough, maybe {2} won''t\
  \ have to hear their ghosts whispering back.
HUMMER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} hums as {2} {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} inventory, hums while\
  \ filling out manifests, hums while rerouting cargo through bureaucratic nightmares. The crew has\
  \ long since accepted that the low hum of an old war tune or a jaunty little ditty means {0} is\
  \ nearby - usually with a clipboard and a sarcastic comment.
HUMMER.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where {2} {9, choice, 0#are|1#is}, {0} is always humming\
  \ something. It''s never the same tune twice, and it''s always just loud enough to be noticed.\
  \ Whether {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} reviewing documents or walking through the barracks, {6}\
  \ ever-present melody has become as much a part of the company as the sound of ''Mek repairs in the\
  \ hangar.
HUMMER.description.2.SUPPORT=The company has lost a lot - good pilots, steady contracts, entire\
  \ DropShips full of people who never made it back. {0} hums because silence is worse. Silence\
  \ means another mission failure. Silence means another name wiped off the roster. Silence means\

HYGIENIC.label=Obsessed with Hygiene

HYGIENIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a very firm stance on personal cleanliness. Boots off\
  \ before entering the barracks, no eating near the control consoles, and absolutely no sneezing\
  \ without covering your mouth. If {2} had it {6} way, every MekWarrior would get decontaminated\
  \ before stepping into a cockpit. The commander refuses to humor {4} - but {0} still sprays down\
  \ every chair with disinfectant when no one''s looking.
HYGIENIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop the war. {1} can''t stop the deaths, the\

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.label=Unusual Sleep Patterns
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t follow a normal sleep cycle - {2}\

  \ anyone else enough to let {4}self drift off.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t sleep like normal people because {6} body\
  \ remembers too much. Every time {2} {9, choice, 0#close|1#closes} {6} eyes, {6} mind replays\
  \ skirmishes {2} barely survived, comrades {2} couldn''t save, the slow-motion collapse of a battle\
  \ gone wrong. {1} {9, choice, 0#stay|1#stays} awake as long as possible, dreading the moment\

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} sleeps in shifts that make no sense to anyone else -\

  \ somehow, the work is still finished on time.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats sleep like an inconvenience. There''s always\
  \ another report to file, another order to review, another detail to double-check. "I''ll sleep\
  \ when things slow down," {2} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} - but things never slow down. {5} coworkers\
  \ have started making bets on when {2}''ll finally pass out at {6} desk.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep isn''t rest - it''s vulnerability. It''s time lost,\
  \ moments {2}  can''t control, a gap in awareness where something can go wrong. {0} puts it off,\
  \ fights it, drinks stimulant-laced tea just to keep going a little longer. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#tell|1#tells} {4}self it''s about efficiency, but deep down, {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\

JOKER.label=Fond of Puns
JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} cracks puns even in the heat of battle. "Looks like that\
  \ guy''s having a meltdown," {2} {9, choice, 0#quip|1#quips} after overheating an enemy ''Mek. {5}\
  \ {8} groans at {6} constant wordplay, but they can''t deny it lightens the tension - just enough\
  \ to keep them steady when the situation turns grim.
JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether it''s a skirmish, a stealth op, or a tense briefing,\
  \ {0} finds time for a pun. "Guess you could say we really blasted through that ambush," {2}\
  \ {2} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} with a wry grin, wiping soot off {6} armor. {5} {8} has stopped\
  \ trying to stop {4} - it''s better to let {4} get it out of {6} systemFluff and keep moving.
JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s puns aren''t just for fun - they''re armor. Every terrible\
  \ joke, every groan-worthy remark is a way to push back against the constant dread of war. "We may\
  \ be fighting uphill, but at least we''ve got a peak advantage," {2} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says} with\
  \ a wink. But smile never reaches {6} eyes.
JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Whatever {0} is doing, there''s always a pun involved. {5}\
  \ colleagues roll their eyes, but even the most jaded warrior cracks a smile now and then.
JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT=The war never stops, the work never ends, but {0} finds a way\
  \ to make it just a little less awful. {1} {9, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} pun-laden sticky notes on\

  \ desk without at least one bad pun. No one likes it - but no one really wants {4} to stop, either.
JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Every pun is forced, every joke just a little too loud. {0} keeps the\
  \ wordplay coming because if {2} {9, choice, 0#stop|1#stops}, {2}''ll have to face the reality of what\
  \ {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} dealing with - the broken machines, the wounded warriors, the paperwork\
  \ documenting another casualty instead of another paycheck. "Looks like someone''s having a rough\
  \ day," {2} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, filling out another death report. The laugh that follows is\

LISTS.label=Compulsive List Maker
LISTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, {0} has a list - objectives, fallback\

LITERAL.description.0.SUPPORT="{0}, patch up that report." {1} {9, choice, 0#grab|1#grabs} a literal\

LITERAL.description.2.SUPPORT="How''s the company holding up, {0}?" someone asks. {1}\

MINIMALIST.label=Extreme Minimalism

  \ it a little tighter on the nights when the war feels particularly close.
MUG.description.0.SUPPORT={0} keeps things running like clockwork, but if anyone so much as touches\

  \ {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} signed off on impossible job lists without blinking, but the day someone\

MUG.description.1.SUPPORT=There could be an emergency, a full company deployment, a reactor on fire\
  \ - but {0} will not start work without drinking from {6} one mug. "Things function better with\

  \ {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} about {6} mug the same way {2} {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} about people\
  \ is concerning.
MUG.description.2.SUPPORT=The bunk, the uniform, the gear - it all belongs to the company. It all\

NAIL_BITER.label=Constant Nail Biter
NAIL_BITER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t flinch under fire, doesn''t panic when missiles\
  \ rain down - but {6} fingers tell a different story. {5} nails are jagged, bitten down to near\
  \ nothing, the casualty of endless waiting, briefing delays, and long hours in the scrum. It''s\
  \ not fear, {2} {9, choice, 0#insist|1#insists}. Just something to do while the next battle looms.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-skirmish, mid-strategy meeting, mid-conversation - {0}''s\
  \ fingers are always near {6} mouth, absentmindedly gnawed as {2} {9, choice, 0#think|1#thinks}.\
  \ "{0}, stop biting your damn nails," someone mutters over comms. A second of silence, then:\
  \ "Huh? Oh. Right." It lasts maybe five minutes before {2} {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts} again.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.COMBATANT={5} hands shake after missions, so {2} {9, choice, 0#bite|1#bites}\
  \ {6} nails. It gives {4} something to focus on, something small to control when everything else\

  \ proof {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still here. At least it''s {6} own damage, not someone else''s.
NAIL_BITER.description.0.SUPPORT={5} job is a battlefield of its own, and {0} feels every\
  \ engagement. Inventory shortages, delayed shipments, missing tools - each issue gets a little more\
  \ nail chewed away. "We''re short on fusion coolant again?" {2} {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters},\
  \ biting the edge of {6} thumbnail. If {2} had an intact fingernail left, it would be a miracle.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} works fast, {6} brain running just ahead of {6} hands, {6}\
  \ teeth worrying at {6} nails between quick jobs. "Hold still, almost done - just let me - "\
  \ crunch. The nervous habit doesn''t slow {4} down, but {6} workspace is often slick with antiseptic\
  \ from another self-inflicted cut.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t talk about {6} stress. {1} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ lash out, {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} break things, {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} complain.\

NICKNAMING.label=Frequent Nicknaming
NICKNAMING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} almost never calls {6} teammates by their actual names.\
  \ The rookie pilot? ''Hotshot.'' The team''s allocated tech? ''Sparky.'' The commander? ''Big Boss.''\
  \ Half the unit has stopped correcting {4}, because by the time they do, {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ already come up with another one.
NICKNAMING.description.1.COMBATANT="Alright, Trash Panda, you take point. Princess, you cover the\
  \ left flank. Trouser Snake, you-" "{0}, I swear, stop calling me that." But {0} doesn''t stop.\
  \ Ever. Once you''re assigned a nickname, it sticks. If you don''t like it? Too bad. That just makes\
  \ {4} say it more.
NICKNAMING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} hands out nicknames like candy. It''s easier than\
  \ remembering real names - because real names come with memories. With losses. With faces {2}''d\
  \ rather not picture when {2} {9, choice, 0#try|1#tries} to sleep. As long as they''re ''Deadeye'' or\
  \ ''Hellhound'' or ''Bulldozer'', {2} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} have to think about how many real\
  \ names {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already forgotten.
NICKNAMING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in titles. The lead mechanic is ''Grease,''\
  \ the MedTech is ''Patches,'' and the newest recruit is ''Grass'' until they earn something better.\
  \ It''s all part of the company''s culture now - at this point, even {2} probably {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ remember their real names.
NICKNAMING.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone who works with {0} gets a nickname, and once {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#assign|1#assigns} one, it''s yours for life. The problem? They don''t always make\
  \ sense. "Hey, ''Wires,'' pass me that wrench." "{0}, I''m not an electrician." "Don''t argue with\
  \ me, Wires." The name sticks. It always sticks.
NICKNAMING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} gives out names because it means someone sees you. Military\
  \ units burn through people fast - warriors, techs, medics, clerks. Most of them get a number on a\
  \ payroll log and little else. But if {0} calls you ''Chief'' or ''Rookie'' or ''Grimlock,'' it means\
  \ you existed. Even if only for a little while.

NIGHT_OWL.label=Night Owl

NIGHT_OWL.description.1.COMBATANT=While the {8} sleeps, {0} patrols, cleans {6} gear, and tweaks\

NIGHT_OWL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} stays up not because {2} {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to, but\

NIGHT_OWL.description.0.SUPPORT=If you need something from {0}, better check after midnight -\

NIGHT_OWL.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s tools are always in motion long after everyone else has\

  \ me and the machines," {2} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, taking a sip of something that definitely\
  \ isn''t just coffee.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.SUPPORT=The company''s debts. The worn-out equipment. The empty beds of\
  \ warriors who aren''t coming back. {0} stays awake long after the others sleep, because someone\
  \ has to see it, to witness the slow collapse. {1} won''t talk about it, won''t wake anyone up - but\
  \ every night, {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} there, staring at the ceiling, wondering how much longer\

NOTE_TAKER.label=Compulsive Note-Taking

NOTE_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Every briefing, every engagement, every conversation - {0} is\

NOTE_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s logs are legendary. Every job, every tool, every assignment\
  \ is recorded somewhere. "Paper trails save lives," {2} {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters}, flipping\

  \ ago. No one ever wins arguments with {0}.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every report, every single action {0} takes gets\

  \ {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} speak - {2} {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands} them a log entry with\
  \ timestamps, materials used, and a breakdown of everything that happened.
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps too many notes. Not just equipment statuses and\
  \ mission briefings, but the slow decay of everything around {4}. Fuel shortages. Unpaid wages.\
  \ The steady reduction of names in the payroll log. One day, someone will look back at {6}\
  \ records and see exactly when the company started dying. But for now, only {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

NOTEBOOK.label=Always Carrying a Notebook
NOTEBOOK.description.0.COMBATANT=Enemy formations, heat sink efficiency, which comrade still\

  \ sketches, and half-finished thoughts written in hurried shorthand. "If I forget, it''s my fault.\
  \ If I write it down, it''s fact."
NOTEBOOK.description.1.COMBATANT=While others rely on intuition, {0} checks {6} notes. "Last\

NOTEBOOK.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t rely on memory. Every job requested, every\

  \ {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} always explain why {2} {9, choice, 0#record|1#records} so much, but\
  \ if someone asks, {2} simply says, "Because someone has to."
NOTEBOOK.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s notebook isn''t just logs - it''s a record of decline.\
  \ Ration cuts, missing payments, the names of warriors who never came back. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#write|1#writes} it all because no one else does. Because someday, the company will\

OBJECT.label=Carries a Personal Object
OBJECT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never enters battle without {6} one personal item - a lucky\
  \ coin, a worn-out playing card, a patch from an old uniform. "You don''t mess with luck," {2}\
  \ {2} {9, choice, 0#say|1#says}, tucking it into {6} pocket before every mission. Whether it actually\
  \ helps or not, {6} {8} knows better than to question it.
OBJECT.description.1.COMBATANT=In the chaos of war, {0} keeps one thing constant. Maybe it''s\
  \ a trinket from home, maybe it''s something given to {4} by someone long gone. It doesn''t matter\
  \ what it is - what matters is that it''s {6}. When the battle''s over and the adrenaline fades, {2}\
  \ {2} {9, choice, 0#grip|1#grips} it tight, reminding {4}self that {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still\
  \ here.
OBJECT.description.2.COMBATANT=The object in {0}''s possession isn''t sentimental - it''s\
  \ survival. A reminder of who {2} used to be, of a promise {2} couldn''t keep, of a person {2} once\

OBJECT.description.0.SUPPORT=Whether it''s a well-worn multitool, an old pocket watch, or a\

  \ got it, but they know {2}''d notice immediately if it ever went missing.
OBJECT.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s job changes, {6} location changes, the people around {4}\
  \ change - but one thing never does. That personal item, the thing always tucked into a pocket,\
  \ clipped to {6} belt, or hidden inside {6} jacket. It''s not about sentimentality. It''s about\
  \ having something that stays the same.
OBJECT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t keep {6} special object because it makes {4} happy. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} it because it reminds {4} of what''s been lost. A tag from a dead\

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.COMBATANT=If an enemy gets away, {0} remembers. If a battle\

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s attention to detail isn''t about perfection -\

RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep is surrender. Sleep is vulnerability. Sleep is trusting\

SNACKS.label=Always Has a Snack
SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} fights like a professional, but {2} {9, choice, 0#eat|1#eats}\
  \ like it''s just as important. Mid-mission? Ration bar. Briefing? Dried fruit. In the scrum? Protein\

SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} eats because it''s routine. Because it''s something normal\
  \ in a world that isn''t. Because if {2} {9, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on unwrapping a snack, just\

STRETCHING.label=Constantly Stretching

STRETCHING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} stretches because it''s something to control. Muscles\

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.label=Suspicious Rituals
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, {0} finds a quiet spot, kneels,\

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t know where {2} picked up {6} habits, only\
  \ that they have to be done. Before every mission, {2} {9, choice, 0#mutter|1#mutters} phrases in a\

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t do anything unless {2} first taps the console\

SUPERVISED_HABITS.label=Highly Supervised Habits
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never enters battle without running the exact same\
  \ pre-mission checks, always in full view of at least one superior officer. If no one''s watching?\

  \ regulations anywhere, but that doesn''t stop {4}.

SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to wonder why {2} had to log {6} every action.\

SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s logs are double-checked, {6} reports personally\
  \ reviewed by command, and every one of {6} transactions requires approval. "It''s just standard\

  \ while {6} every action is quietly noted.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just log {6} hours - {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ {6} workstation is monitored, {6} comms are recorded, and {6} tasks are reported up the chain.\
  \ If someone asks why, {2} {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "It''s just how things work around here."\

SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t step out of line, not even a little. The last time\

COMBAT_POET.label=Recites Poetry

COMBAT_POET.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t recite poetry for theatrics. {1} {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ it because it''s how {2} {9, choice, 0#cope|1#copes}. The right words make chaos feel structured,\

COMBAT_POET.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just talk - {2} quotes. Team meetings? A few\

  \ Whether anyone appreciates it or not, {2} {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a verse for everything.
COMBAT_POET.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t just answer questions - {2}''ll answer them in poetry.\
  \ Sometimes it''s {6} own, sometimes it''s old, forgotten texts, and sometimes it''s just whatever\

COMBAT_POET.description.2.SUPPORT={0} speaks in poetry because it keeps the emptiness at bay.\

CUSTOM_DECALS.label=Obsessed with Custom Decals
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t leave anything plain. Armor, weapons,\

  \ distinctively {6}.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s decals aren''t random; they mean something. Every\

CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows the war doesn''t guarantee survival. But {6}\

CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to let anything be generic. {5} tools, {6}\
  \ workstation, even {6} reports have some kind of personalized insignia. If someone borrows\
  \ something of {6}, they''ll know - because {6} signature touch is everywhere.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats the unit insignia like a necessary part of life.\
  \ A blank wall? Unacceptable. An untouched case? Needs a mark. Whether it''s subtle or elaborate,\

  \ {9, choice, 0#work|1#works} with.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} personalizes things because {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\

DO_IT_YOURSELF.label=Obsessive Do-It-Yourselfer

ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s colleagues have given up trying to figure out {6}\

  \ speaking like {2} just walked out of a frontier settlement. "Oh, sugar, don''t worry none, I got it\

ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t even realize when {2} {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it.\

ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t force the accent changes - they happen on their\

AMBUSH_LOVER.label=Walks Softly

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.label=Breaks Radio Silence
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} understands the importance of stealth and discipline,\

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} hates absolute silence. It makes {6} skin crawl,\

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has been there - the silence stretching on too long,\

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} knows when to keep {6} mouth shut. {1} just\

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t like silence. It feels unnatural, wrong, too\

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows exactly what it feels like to wait on the other\

CONVOY_LOVER.label=Prefers Convoy Missions
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see convoy missions as boring logistics - {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} them as a real test of skill. Protecting a moving force, managing ambush\

  \ predictable. Convoy missions? That''s where you prove you know what you''re doing."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} likes that convoy missions matter. There''s something\
  \ different about ensuring something critical gets through, rather than just destroying a target.\
  \ "You''re not just fighting to win. You''re fighting to deliver something that matters."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched convoy missions go horribly wrong.\

CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} enjoys the rhythm of a convoy. The movement, the\

  \ {4}. "Nothing''s better than a well-organized convoy rolling like a well-oiled machine."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just care about getting somewhere - {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#enjoy|1#enjoys} the process of getting there. The planning, the movement, the sense\

CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} understands that war isn''t won by battles - it''s won by\

CAMOUFLAGE.label=Likes to Blend In
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} {9, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure {6}\

  \ {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} the fight itself. "If they don''t see it coming, they don''t get a\

CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in standard color schemes or obvious\
  \ silhouettes. {5} equipment always matches the terrain - dust-covered in deserts, ice-slicked in\
  \ tundras, urban-camouflaged in cities. "Standing out is just asking to get shot first."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched people die because they stood out, because\
  \ their gear wasn''t hidden well enough. {1} learned the hard way that survival is about not being\

DISTANT_LEADER.label=Leads from a Distance

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} trusts instinct over orders, flow over formation. {5}\
  \ style is chaotic but effective, and somehow, it keeps working. "Plans fall apart. Tactics get\

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to follow orders, used to stick to the doctrine.\
  \ But {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} watched it fail, seen people die because they did what they were\

GEOMETRY_GURU.label=Geometry Guru
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} {9, choice, 0#calculate|1#calculates}.\
  \ Every shot, every movement, every approach is based on angles, arcs, and positioning. "You don''t\
  \ just fire - you predict. You don''t just move - you control the space."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never fires blindly; every shot is lined up, ricocheted,\
  \ or angled for maximum impact. {1} {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} the battlefield like a perfectly\

GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can''t unsee geometry in everything. The way things align,\
  \ the way efficiency improves when angles are perfect, the mathematical beauty of well-organized\
  \ space. "You don''t just put things down randomly. You optimize them."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a habit of breaking down even the simplest things into\
  \ mathematical terms. Whether it''s lining up objects, explaining movement patterns, or analyzing\
  \ layouts, {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} always thinking in angles. "Look, you could do it that way, but\
  \ if you shift it 17 degrees, you''ll maximize efficiency by at least 12%."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.SUPPORT={0} finds comfort in numbers, angles, and predictable\
  \ calculations because everything else is chaos. {1} can''t control the war, the losses, the\
  \ destruction - but {2} can control how things align, how things flow, how everything fits into\
  \ place. "The world falls apart, people die, plans fail. But geometry? Geometry is perfect."

TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t obvious about it, but any time someone accidentally\
  \ brushes against {4}, claps {4} on the back, or leans in too close, {6} body reacts before {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#do|1#does}. "Nothing''s wrong. Just - don''t do that again."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} is constantly adjusting, subtly shifting away from people\

  \ just... prefer some space."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t hate touch - {2} just can''t handle it. It makes\

HOLOVID_FANATIC.label=Holovid Fanatic
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a line from a holovid for every situation. Even in\

HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} fully believes in the coolest, most dramatic ways to\

HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows real war isn''t like the holovids, but if {2}\

HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows holovids are escapism, but {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} care. They''re structured, predictable, full of meaning. Unlike\

STUTTERS.label=Stutters

STUTTERS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} wasn''t always like this. Maybe it was the stress, the\

STUTTERS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t mind people noticing {6} stutter - {2} {9, choice, 0#mind|1#minds}\

STUTTERS.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s body keeps going, but {6} mind is fractured in ways {2}''ll\

ACROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} plays it cool, but if you watch closely, {2} never\

CLAUSTROPHOBIA.label=Fear of Enclosed Spaces

  \ a fleeting moment of pure adrenaline that nothing else can match. "You hear that? That''s the sound\
  \ of life happening. And I intend to enjoy every second of it."
HEDONIST.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never lets a win pass without making the most of it. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives} fast, hard, and without restraint, because in {6} mind, there''s no\
  \ point in holding back. "We survived today? Then we drink, we feast, and we take what we can.\
  \ Because tomorrow? Tomorrow is a gamble."
HEDONIST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has stopped believing in long-term plans, in saving up, in\
  \ waiting for better days. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen too many people die with regrets, too many\
  \ final moments filled with ''what ifs''. {1} {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to be one of them. "I\
  \ don''t care what comes next. Right now, I''m alive. And that means I take everything life has to\
  \ offer."
HEDONIST.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t one to deny {4}self pleasure, no matter how bleak things\
  \ get. If there''s good food, good drink, or something enjoyable to be had, {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ already indulging. "Oh, you''re telling me I shouldn''t enjoy myself? That sounds like a you problem.
HEDONIST.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in waiting for a ''better time''. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#find|1#finds} pleasure wherever {2} can, whenever {2} can, and {9, choice, 0#drag|1#drags}\
  \ others into the fun - sometimes against their better judgment. "You''re really gonna sit there and\
  \ be miserable when you could be having a damn good time? Come on."
HEDONIST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just like pleasure - {2} {9, choice, 0#demand|1#demands}\
  \ it, because {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen what happens to people who keep putting it off. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} tomorrow isn''t promised, so {2} {9, choice, 0#take|1#takes} everything\
  \ while {2} still can. "You think we have time to waste? That we''ll all just live long enough for a\

BROADCASTS_MUSIC.label=Broadcasts Music
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} {9, choice, 0#set|1#sets} the\
  \ mood. {5} comms are always playing something, whether it''s dramatic orchestral scores, pounding\
  \ war drums, or completely inappropriate upbeat tunes. "If we''re going into hell, we might as well\
  \ have a killer playlist."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} {8} energized and {6} enemies confused\
  \ by ensuring every engagement comes with a backing track. One moment it''s hard-hitting metal,\
  \ the next it''s a slow, eerie hum that unsettles everyone. "Oh, you don''t like my music? Guess\
  \ you better finish the fight fast then."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps the music going because without it, all that''s\
  \ left is the sound of gunfire, screams, and things {2}''d rather not remember. {1} {9, choice, 0#drown|1#drowns}\
  \ it all out before it can creep in. "You want me to turn it off? No. I don''t do silence."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s workspace is never quiet. Whether it''s a steady\
  \ beat, a slow melody, or something completely chaotic, there''s always some kind of sound filling\
  \ the air. "I work better with music. And you? You''ll get used to it."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t ask permission - {2} just {9, choice, 0#start|1#starts}\
  \ playing whatever music {2} {9, choice, 0#want|1#wants}, expecting everyone else to deal with it.\
  \ If someone complains? {1} {9, choice, 0#turn|1#turns} it up just a little louder. "You''d rather\
  \ sit in silence? That''s the real crime here."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows that if {2} ever {9, choice, 0#let|1#lets} things\
  \ go silent, the memories will start creeping back in. The people who aren''t here anymore, the\
  \ things {2} should have done differently. So the music stays on - always. "The second the music\
  \ stops, that''s when it gets bad. And I don''t plan on letting it stop."

NEMESIS.label=Has a Nemesis
NEMESIS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} with\
  \ purpose. There''s always one name, one face, one opponent that {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} constantly\
  \ measuring {4}self against. Every battle is just another step toward proving, once and for all,\
  \ who''s better. "Tell me they''re here. Tell me they showed up. I want this fight to matter."
NEMESIS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has an personal enemy and {2} {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers}\
  \ every fight, every close call, every trick {6} nemesis has ever pulled. {1} {9, choice, 0#replay|1#replays}\
  \ past encounters in {6} head, looking for patterns, weaknesses, an edge. "Last time, they hesitated\
  \ when pressured. This time? I won''t give them the chance."
NEMESIS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows that most fights don''t matter, that most enemies are\
  \ just faceless obstacles. But there''s one. One that is different. One that is personal. This\
  \ rivalry is the only thing left that still feels like it has meaning. "They''ll either kill me,\
  \ or I''ll kill them. And that''s the only thing I know for sure anymore."
NEMESIS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has one person who, for whatever reason, has become {6} eternal\
  \ competition. It might be serious, ridiculous, or entirely one-sided, but {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to back down. "Oh, they did it first? Great. Now I have to do it\
  \ better."
NEMESIS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} turns everything into a direct challenge between {4}self and\
  \ {6} nemesis. It could be work efficiency, problem-solving, or even something as simple as\
  \ making coffee - {2} must come out on top. "If they did it in five minutes, I''ll do it in four.\
  \ Watch me."
NEMESIS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just have a rival - {2} {9, choice, 0#have|1#has} a\
  \ fixation. A constant presence in {6} life that keeps {4} pushing forward, staying sharp, refusing\
  \ to slip into complacency. Without that challenge, {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not sure {2}''d know\
  \ what to do with {4}self anymore. "Without them, I don''t know who I''d be. And that scares me more\
  \ than losing."

FEAR_MEKS.label=Fear of Mek
FEAR_MEKS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} hates being near ''Meks, not because they''re ineffective,\
  \ but because they''re too effective. Every time {2} {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees} one move, {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#remember|1#remembers} what they leave behind - crushed buildings, burning wreckage,\
  \ bodies no one ever digs out. "You don''t pilot a ''Mek. You unleash one. And when it moves, something\
  \ always gets left in ruins."
FEAR_MEKS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} won''t touch a ''Mek unless there''s no other choice. {1}''d\
  \ rather fight on foot, in vehicles, anywhere that doesn''t feel like piloting a walking war\
  \ crime. "You ever seen a ''Mek step on a person? No? Then you don''t understand why I don''t trust\
  \ those things."
FEAR_MEKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched entire towns vanish under ''Mek fire.\
  \ {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen warriors pulped by autocannons meant for armored targets. And the\
  \ worst part? Most MekWarriors don''t seem to care, they just continue walking forward like nothing\
  \ happened."
FEAR_MEKS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never stands too close to a ''Mek, never trusts that they''re\
  \ fully powered down, never walks beneath one without {6} pulse spiking. They''re too big, too\
  \ unnatural, too much like monsters pretending to be machines. "I don''t care if it''s offline.\
  \ That thing''s one bad signal away from flattening this entire place."
FEAR_MEKS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t see engineering marvels, doesn''t admire firepower or\
  \ armor plating. When {2} {9, choice, 0#look|1#looks} at a ''Mek, all {2} {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees}\
  \ are crushed buildings, burning streets, people who never had a chance to run. "You ever watch a\
  \ ''Mek walk through a city? The pilot thinks it''s just debris. I''ve seen the bodies they pull out\
  \ after."
FEAR_MEKS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just dislike ''Meks - {2} {9, choice, 0#fear|1#fears}\
  \ them, because {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been there when they''ve turned entire streets into craters,\
  \ reduced entire platoons to nothing but a red mist. And {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} they''re not\

  \ left."

LOCAL_CONNECTOR.label=Local Connector
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just see territory - {2} {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees}\
  \ people. Whenever {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} deployed, {2} {9, choice, 0#learn|1#learns} the culture,\
  \ the customs, the stories of those who live there. {1} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} believe in\
  \ fighting blindly. "You want to survive out here? Then talk to the ones who actually live here\
  \ - they''ve been surviving longer than we have."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just here to fight - {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ here to understand. {1} {9, choice, 0#talk|1#talks} to locals, {9, choice, 0#listen|1#listens} to\

  \ {1} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that alliances built through respect last longer than those built\
  \ through fear. "You think we can just roll in, do our job, and leave? That''s why so many before us\
  \ failed."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust command, strategy reports, or maps drawn\
  \ by people who have never stepped foot here. {1} {9, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} locals. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that understanding them is the difference between life and death.\
  \ "You ignore them, you die. It''s that simple. And when you do, they won''t mourn you. They''ll say\

LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t treat new places like temporary stops. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#learn|1#learns} the culture, the etiquette, the things outsiders usually ignore.\
  \ If {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to be somewhere new, {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} going to do it\
  \ right. "If you don''t bother to learn how people live, don''t be surprised when they don''t want you\
  \ here."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never stays just with {6} unit - {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#integrate|1#integrates} into local life. {1}''ll be found talking with vendors,\
  \ learning regional slang, and making {4}self at home. "You want to know what''s really going on?\
  \ Talk to the people who actually live here. Not the ones just passing through."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just curious - {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} calculating.\
  \ {1} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows} that when things go south, it won''t be {6} team, {6} leadership,\
  \ or {6} training that saves {4}. It''ll be whether or not the locals think {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ worth saving. "One day, you''re going to need a favor. And if you didn''t bother to earn their trust\
  \ first, you''re not getting one."

HATRED.label=Hates the Enemy
HATRED.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight against the enemy - {2} {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ because of them. Every engagement is personal, every battle another chance to wipe them from\
  \ existence. "No mercy. No second chances. If they''re standing, they''re still a threat."
HATRED.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see gray areas or moral debates. {1} {9, choice, 0#see|1#sees}\
  \ right and wrong, us and them. The enemy isn''t just someone on the other side - they''re a stain\
  \ that needs to be wiped out. "I don''t want to hear about ''understanding them.'' I want to hear that\
  \ they''re dead."
HATRED.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hate without reason. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen the\
  \ ruins, the bodies, the aftermath of what the enemy has done. {1} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ fight for glory - {2} {9, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} for revenge. "You don''t ''negotiate'' with\
  \ butchers. You make sure they never get the chance to do it again."
HATRED.description.0.SUPPORT={0} won''t entertain conversations about why the enemy does what they\
  \ do. {1} won''t listen to sympathy, won''t engage with debate. To {4}, the only good conversation\
  \ about the enemy is one that ends with their destruction. "I don''t care about their motives. I\
  \ care about making sure they don''t walk away from this war."
HATRED.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just oppose the enemy - {2} {9, choice, 0#despire|1#despires}\
  \ them. Any attempt at rationalizing, debating, or finding common ground sets {4} on edge. "You\
  \ think they''d show you the same sympathy? They wouldn''t. So stop wasting your breath."
HATRED.description.2.SUPPORT={0} carries the scars of what the enemy has done. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ lost too much, seen too much, felt too much pain to ever let it go. {5} hate isn''t blind - it''s\
  \ earned. "If you knew what I knew, if you''d seen what I''ve seen, you''d hate them too. And you\
  \ wouldn''t stop until they were gone."

PANTSLESS.label=Refuses to Wear Pants
PANTSLESS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} storms into battle bare-legged and completely unbothered,\
  \ treating the absence of pants like it''s a tactical decision. If anyone asks, {2}''ll claim it''s\
  \ for better mobility - but really, {2} just {9, choice, 0#hate|1#hates} the feel of fabric on {6}\
  \ legs. "Look, pants slow me down. You want me fast, or you want me fashionable?"
PANTSLESS.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s refusal to wear pants isn''t a statement - it''s just how {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#live|1#lives}. Cold weather, hot weather, formal gatherings - it doesn''t matter. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#stand|1#stands} there in nothing at all, arms crossed, completely unapologetic.\
  \ "You think a pair of pants is going to make me a better fighter? Didn''t think so."
PANTSLESS.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s resistance to pants isn''t a joke - it''s a refusal to be\
  \ restricted by anything, even clothing. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} spent too long being told where\
  \ to go, what to do, how to live. No one''s going to strap {4} into uniform now. "I''ve lost too much\
  \ to let someone tell me what to wear. If they don''t like it, they can try and stop me."
PANTSLESS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} shows up to meetings pants-free with the confidence of someone\
  \ who genuinely believes this is everyone else''s problem, not {6}. {1}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ completely immune to side-eyes, awkward stares, and HR complaints. "It''s not a violation of the\
  \ dress code if they never specified pants."
PANTSLESS.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s hatred of pants is a non-negotiable part of {6} identity. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#work|1#works} perfectly well without them, so why bother changing now? If anyone\
  \ mentions it, {2} just {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "I''m getting the job done. What else matters?"
PANTSLESS.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s refusal to wear pants is less about comfort and more about\
  \ control. After years of living under rules and orders, ditching pants is {6} way of reclaiming\
  \ some small measure of autonomy. "They took a lot from me over the years. They''re not taking my\
  \ freedom to breathe."

MAKES_CLOTHES.label=Makes Clothes for Others
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} might be a walking weapon on the battlefield, but off it,\
  \ {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a steady hand and a knack for stitching. {5} {8} has learned that\
  \ if their gear rips, {0} will have it patched up - and probably improved - within a day. "Sure,\
  \ I could let supply handle it. Or I could fix it right and not have it fall apart in the middle\
  \ of a skirmish."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t make a big deal about it, but half the squad is\
  \ wearing something {2}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} made. {1}''ll hand you a scarf or a jacket with zero\
  \ fanfare, like {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} handing over ammo. "Just take it. You''ll freeze otherwise.\
  \ Don''t make it weird."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s habit of making clothes started after too many cold\
  \ nights, too many friends without enough gear. If {2} can''t keep them alive in a fight, the least\
  \ {2} can do is keep them warm after. "You wear it, you remember why you survived. And you don''t\
  \ waste it."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just make clothes - {2} customizes them. Half the\
  \ crew is walking around in sweaters with inside jokes or poorly hidden insults stitched into the\
  \ hems. "Yeah, the stitching says ''hero.'' Didn''t say which kind of hero, though."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t ask for thanks - {2} just {9, choice, 0#hand|1#hands}\
  \ over a jacket or a pair of gloves and moves on. {1} {9, choice, 0#treat|1#treats} it like it''s\
  \ basic maintenance, not a personal favor. "It''s cold. You didn''t have gloves. Problem solved."
MAKES_CLOTHES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} makes clothes because it''s something tangible, something\
  \ {2} can control when everything else feels like it''s spiraling. The fact that people wear {6} work\
  \ means a part of {4} is protecting them, even when {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not there. "If you''re\
  \ going to bleed, you might as well bleed in something that fits."

ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.label=Acts Suspiciously

  \ If I were planning something shady, you wouldn''t know until it was too late."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s habit of avoiding direct answers and disappearing\
  \ at odd hours has raised more than a few eyebrows. {1} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} bother denying\
  \ it - {2} just {2} {9, choice, 0#meet|1#meets} suspicion with a deadpan expression and a shrug. "If\
  \ you have to ask what I''m doing, you already know I''m not gonna tell you."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t explain {4}self because {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ that if people knew the truth, they''d never trust {4} again. {5} motives are buried under layers\
  \ of necessity and survival. "You don''t need to know why I''m doing this. You just need to decide if\
  \ you''re coming with me or not."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has a habit of showing up where {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ not supposed to be and knowing things {2} shouldn''t know. If you ask {4} how, {2} just\
  \ {9, choice, 0#smirk|1#smirks} and changes the subject. "Oh, that? Let''s just say I have sources."
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s tendency to keep secrets and dodge questions makes\
  \ {4} a walking mystery. {1}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} not lying - but {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} definitely\
  \ not telling the whole truth either. "Do you really wanna know, or are you just being polite?"
ACTS_SUSPICIOUSLY.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s secrecy isn''t about deception - it''s about protection.\
  \ If people knew what {2} knew, they''d sleep a lot less soundly at night. "It''s not that I don''t\

NIGHTMARES.label=Suffers from Nightmares
NIGHTMARES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} jokes about {6} lack of sleep like it''s a personality trait.\
  \ {1}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the first one awake and the last one to rest, but no one knows what keeps\
  \ {4} up at night. "Yeah, I sleep great - if you count two hours of staring at the ceiling and\

  \ eyes. "It''s fine. I''ll sleep when I''m dead. Or maybe not."
NIGHTMARES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s dreams are haunted by the faces of the dead - people {2}\

  \ never be able to forget. {1} {9, choice, 0#wake|1#wakes} up gasping, clutching {6} weapon, unsure\
  \ if {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} still dreaming. "Sleep is just another battlefield I need to survive."
NIGHTMARES.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s solution to bad sleep is to avoid it altogether. {1}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ always the last one up, tinkering with gear or working late, as if staying awake can hold the\
  \ nightmares at bay. "Sleep''s overrated. Who needs it when you''ve got coffee and bad decisions?"

NIGHTMARES.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s nightmares aren''t just bad dreams - they''re memories,\
  \ regrets, and ghosts clawing their way to the surface. {1} {9, choice, 0#wake|1#wakes} up in a\

FREEZES.label=Freezes Up
FREEZES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} moves with confidence until the moment things go wrong. Then {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#lock|1#locks} up, mind racing but body refusing to follow. Afterward, {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#brush|1#brushes} it off with a half-smile. "Yeah, tactical pause. That''s what we''re\
  \ calling it."
FREEZES.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s body reacts faster than {6} mind sometimes - except when it\
  \ doesn''t. There are moments when the pressure hits, the noise fades, and {2} just... stops. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#hate|1#hates} how long it takes to snap out of it. "I know. I froze. Won''t happen\
  \ again."
FREEZES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s hesitation isn''t a flaw - it''s the weight of too many failures,\
  \ too many ghosts whispering in {6} ear. Every decision echoes the last mistake, and sometimes the\
  \ fear of being wrong keeps {4} from acting at all. "I''ve seen what happens when you make the wrong\
  \ call. Sometimes standing still feels safer."
FREEZES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can handle routine, but the second things get unpredictable,\
  \ {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} stuck in place, mentally buffering while everyone else reacts. "I''m\
  \ working on it. Just... give me a minute to reboot."
FREEZES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hates how {6} mind locks up under pressure. It''s not that {2}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} know what to do - it''s that {6} brain just refuses to cooperate\
  \ when it matters most. "It''s like my body forgets how to function. Annoying as hell."
FREEZES.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s hesitation isn''t random. It''s tied to something deeper - a\
  \ moment in {6} past when acting too quickly cost {4} everything. Now, sometimes, {6} mind shuts\
  \ down rather than risk another mistake. "You don''t get it. I didn''t freeze because I didn''t know\

TRAUMATIZED.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t talk about what happened - {2} just {9, choice, 0#carry|1#carry}\

REGRETS.label=Regrets a Terrible Crime
REGRETS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} talks about {6} terrible crime like it''s ancient history, even\

  \ peace with it - but {0} knows better. "Yeah, I did that. Turns out ''sorry'' doesn''t fix that kind\

REGRETS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} mentions {6} crime like it''s a funny story - until you realize the\

DARK_SECRET.label=Has a Dark Secret
DARK_SECRET.description.0.COMBATANT={0} jokes too much when people get too close. {5} easy grin\
  \ and casual tone are defenses, shields against the possibility that someone might start asking\

DARK_SECRET.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows that if anyone finds out what {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

  \ did... what I am... you wouldn''t just hate me. You''d kill me."
DARK_SECRET.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has mastered the art of looking unbothered when certain topics\
  \ are brought up. {1} {9, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} {6} answers light, {6} tone even, never letting\
  \ anything slip. But the cracks show when someone presses too hard. "Why are you so curious? What\
  \ do you think you''re going to find?"
DARK_SECRET.description.1.SUPPORT={0} reacts fast when the wrong questions come up. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#cut|1#cuts} conversations short, {9, choice, 0#change|1#changes} subjects, and\

ANTHROPOMORPHIC.label=Likes Anthropomorphic Animals
ANTHROPOMORPHIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s {8} gave up questioning {6} cat-themed armor when\
  \ they remember {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} the one keeping them alive. The stylized ears on {6}\
  \ helmet? That''s not just for show - it''s part of the look. "Yeah, the ears are deliberate. You think\
  \ this much style happens by accident?"
ANTHROPOMORPHIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hide it. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got custom\
  \ patches, decals, and even a helmet design that features pointed ears. When someone tries to make\
  \ it a joke, {0} just raises an eyebrow. "Yeah, it''s a fox. Yes, on purpose. Any more questions?"
ANTHROPOMORPHIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s connection to anthropomorphic animals isn''t just a\
  \ quirk - it''s part of how {2} {9, choice, 0#cope|1#copes} with the carnage of {6} life. {1}\
  \ {9, choice, 0#retreat|1#retreats} into that identity when the battlefield gets too loud. "When\

ANTHROPOMORPHIC.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s workspace is covered with small anthropomorphic fox\

  \ {9, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs}. "Some people are into sports. I''m into foxes. Don''t make it\
  \ weird."
ANTHROPOMORPHIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s off-duty clothes tend to feature animal motifs - subtle\

  \ honestly? It looks good."
ANTHROPOMORPHIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s attachment to anthropomorphic animals isn''t just\
  \ lighthearted - it''s a tether to something softer, a reminder that there''s more to life than war\
  \ and violence. It''s not about fantasy; it''s about holding on to something innocent. "You think\
  \ it''s stupid? Maybe. But sometimes you need a reason to smile."

CLUMSY.label=Overwhelming Clumsy
CLUMSY.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s teammates have learned to clear the area when {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ getting into the DropShip. {1}''{9, choice, 0#ve|1#s} knocked over equipment, tripped on the boarding\
  \ ramp, and once managed to dislodge an entire communications array just by leaning on it. "It''s\
  \ not a real deployment until I''ve broken something important."
CLUMSY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} moves with deadly precision once {2}''{9, choice, 0#re|1#s} actually\

CLUMSY.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s clumsiness isn''t funny to {4} - it''s a liability. {1}\

CLUMSY.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s coworkers have stopped letting {4} carry anything important. {1}\

JUSTIFIES.label=Believes the End Justifies the Means
JUSTIFIES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t waste time on moral debates. If cutting corners or\

  \ result we needed. Let''s not ruin it by asking too many questions."
JUSTIFIES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} is coldly efficient when it comes to mission outcomes. If\

  \ hesitate. It''s not that {2} {9, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} care - it''s that {2} {9, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ caring gets in the way. "We finish the mission. We come back alive. Everything else is optional."

  \ long as the outcome works in their favor. "If you didn''t see it happen, it didn''t happen. That''s\

JUSTIFIES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t care about the process - {2} {9, choice, 0#care|1#cares}\

ENJOYS_DRAMA.label=Enjoys Causing Interpersonal Drama
ENJOYS_DRAMA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a gift for pushing the right buttons at the wrong time.\
  \ Mid-mission, {2}''ll casually mention someone''s last screw-up or make an offhand comment about {8}\
  \ hierarchy - just to watch the tension rise. "Hey, I''m just saying - if you don''t trust your mates,\
  \ maybe that''s the problem."
ENJOYS_DRAMA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} knows exactly how to get under people''s skin, and sometimes\
  \ {2} {9, choice, 0#do|1#does} it on purpose. {1} {9, choice, 0#claim|1#claims} it''s to sharpen teamwork,\
  \ but really, {2} just {9, choice, 0#like|1#likes} seeing how people react. "You two gonna figure\
  \ this out, or should I start placing bets?"
ENJOYS_DRAMA.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s habit of stirring conflict isn''t random - it''s calculated.\
  \ If the {8} is too busy resenting each other, they''re not thinking about the mission''s death\
  \ toll. {0} absorbs their anger so they don''t have to face the fear. "If they''re mad at me,\
  \ they''re not scared. I can handle that."
ENJOYS_DRAMA.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s favorite pastime is setting two coworkers against each\

  \ {9, choice, 0#present|1#presents} the facts in the most inflammatory way possible. "Wow, I swore\
  \ you said you''d finished that report. Maybe I misheard."
ENJOYS_DRAMA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} knows exactly how to spread just enough information to create\
  \ friction. {1}''ll mention a questionable decision, an overlooked detail - anything that makes people\
  \ start questioning each other. "Look, I''m not saying they''re incompetent. I''m just asking why it\
  \ keeps happening."
ENJOYS_DRAMA.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s habit of causing drama is about control. If people are\
  \ fighting with each other, they''re not looking at the bigger problems - or at {0}. If stirring\
  \ up resentment keeps things from unraveling completely, so be it. "If they''re too angry to think,\
  \ they''re too angry to panic. You can thank me later."
