ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.label=Constantly Adjusting Clothes
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.COMBATANT=Every strap, every buckle, every seal - {0} checks them all,\
  \ again and again. {5} battle gear is adjusted with the same precision no matter the circumstance.\
  \ {1} claims it''s discipline, but in truth, it''s a ritual to calm {6} nerves.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never feels quite right in {6} gear, always tugging at a\
  \ strap or shifting {6} gloves even mid-firefight. To {6} {8}, it''s just a quirk, but those\
  \ who''ve fought beside {4} long enough know: {0} is always waiting for disaster. Maybe it''s\
  \ because {2}''s seen too many comrades get vaped by a laser, or maybe it''s just instinct. Either\
  \ way, when {0} starts adjusting {6} gear a little too often, it''s time to take cover.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.COMBATANT={5} gear never fits right. {5} pistol holster is always too\
  \ tight or too loose. {5} boots rub raw against {6} heels. It doesn''t matter what uniform {2}\
  \ wears or what battlefield {2}''s dropped into - {0} will never be comfortable. Some say {2}''s\
  \ fidgety. Others think {2}''s just waiting for the day {2} won''t need to adjust anything ever\
  \ again. Because dead men don''t need to fix their collars.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} insists that every uniform, flight suit, and cooling vest\
  \ is properly fitted before deployment. If {2} sees a tech in a grease-stained jumpsuit with an\
  \ undone collar, they''ll get an earful - because a ragged soldier is a careless one, and\
  \ carelessness gets people killed.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.1.SUPPORT=Between adjusting {6} sleeves and straightening {6} belt, {0}\
  \ runs logistics with unsettling speed. {1} can load a DropShip in record time while never once\
  \ standing still. Some think {2}''s just high-strung, but the company keeps running because of {4}.
ADJUSTS_CLOTHES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} believes if everything is in its place - uniforms pressed,\
  \ boots polished, reports properly filed - maybe, just maybe, fate won''t notice {4}. But in a\
  \ military unit, paperwork means nothing when a JumpShip goes missing, or when the employer\
  \ decides your contract isn''t profitable enough to honor. {0} keeps adjusting {6} cuffs,\
  \ knowing it won''t save {4}.

AFFECTIONATE.label=Overly Affectionate
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} fights like a demon and hugs like a bear. Before a\
  \ mission, {2}''s patting backs, ruffling hair, and making sure everyone knows they''re {6} ''battle\
  \ brothers and sisters.'' Even in the middle of a firefight, {2}''ll crack jokes and shout\
  \ encouragement over comms. Some love {4} for it - others just tolerate the inevitable post-mission\
  \ shoulder squeeze.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.COMBATANT=In the modern military, most people keep their distance - losing\
  \ friends is inevitable. Not {0}. {1} remembers every name, every fallen comrade, and {2}''ll\
  \ make damn sure no one in {6} unit dies feeling alone. Whether it''s an arm around your shoulders\
  \ before battle or a whispered, "We''ve got this," before charging into hell, {0} refuses to let\
  \ the universe turn {4} cold.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s always there, hand on your shoulder, telling you that\
  \ everything''s gonna be okay. {1} calls everyone "brother" or "sister," and {2} means it. But those\
  \ who''ve been around long enough notice something eerie - {2}''s always closest to the ones who don''t\
  \ make it back. It''s almost like {2} can sense when it''s someone''s last fight. And when {2} gives\
  \ you that tight, lingering hug before deployment... well, you better hope {2}''s wrong.
AFFECTIONATE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} runs things like a family dinner table, always checking if\
  \ you''ve eaten, gotten enough rest, and - somehow - if you''re warm enough. {1} hands out coffee with a\
  \ reassuring pat on the back and calls the greenest recruits ''kiddo'' regardless of their age.\
  \ Even the grizzled veterans can''t stay mad at {4} for long.
AFFECTIONATE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} means well, but {6} tendency to clap people on the back,\
  \ sling an arm over their shoulders, or hug them when they least expect it has led to more than\
  \ one awkward moment. {5} warmth is rare, but let''s be real - there''s a reason HR gave {4} another\
  \ warning after that last Christmas party.
AFFECTIONATE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} makes sure everyone feels wanted, needed, remembered. {1}\
  \ laughs with the fresh-faced recruits, gives the ''Mekanics a warm shoulder squeeze after a long\
  \ shift, and never lets a MekWarrior take off without a genuine, "Be safe, okay?" But in this\
  \ line of work, people disappear - sometimes violently, sometimes just gone between contracts.\
  \ {0} remembers all their names. And {2} never stops grieving.

APOLOGETIC.label=Overly Apologetic
APOLOGETIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is a competent warrior, but you''d never know it from the\
  \ way {2} apologizes after every shot. Missed a target? "Sorry about that." Nailed a headshot?\
  \ "Hope that wasn''t too brutal." Even enemy pilots getting cored out by {6} autocannon might hear\
  \ a muttered "Didn''t mean for it to go that way..." over comms.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.COMBATANT=No matter where {2} is, {0} can''t stop apologizing. {1}''ll say\
  \ "Sorry" for calling a warning too late, for calling it too early, for asking a question, and\
  \ sometimes just for existing. {1} fights hard, but {6} {8} suspects {2}''d apologize to an\
  \ inbound PPC if given the chance.
APOLOGETIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} says "Sorry" like a prayer. {1} apologizes to the comrades\
  \ {2} couldn''t save, to the enemies {2} had to kill, and to {4}self for believing the fighting\
  \ would ever end. Maybe {2}''s already dead inside, or maybe {2}''s just waiting for the battlefield\
  \ to make it official. Either way, when {0} starts whispering apologies mid-firefight, it''s a\
  \ bad omen.
APOLOGETIC.description.0.SUPPORT=Need ammo? "Sorry it took so long." Ration packs taste like\
  \ cardboard? "I''m really sorry about that." DropShip delayed by pirate activity? "Wish I could\
  \ fix it, truly." {0} apologizes for things that aren''t {6} fault, but {6} relentless\
  \ politeness means people rarely yell at {4} - at least, not for long.
APOLOGETIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} is good at {6} job, but {2}''ll never admit it. No matter how\
  \ well {2} manages things, {2} acts like a single misstep could doom the entire unit. {1}''ll\
  \ triple-check orders, then apologize for bothering people about them. If you thank {4}, {2}''ll\
  \ probably just say, "Oh, it wasn''t much, really. Sorry if it was."
APOLOGETIC.description.2.SUPPORT=Military life is brutal, and when things go wrong, someone has to\
  \ take the fall. {0}, somehow, always ends up volunteering. A shipment lost to raiders? "I\
  \ should''ve arranged better security." A contract gone bad? "I should''ve checked the fine print."\
  \ Even when it''s not {6} fault, {0} takes the weight of the unit''s sins - and sooner or later,\
  \ the universe will demand payment.

BOOKWORM.label=Always Reading
BOOKWORM.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s never without a datapad, whether it''s field manuals,\
  \ After-Action Reports, or ancient texts on combined-arms strategy. {1} absorbs tactics like a\
  \ sponge, always searching for an edge. If you see {4} flipping through a history book before a\
  \ mission, don''t interrupt - {2}''s probably looking for a maneuver that saved some long-dead\
  \ general''s skin.
BOOKWORM.description.1.COMBATANT=Between battles, {0}''s nose is buried in a book - anything from\
  \ war poetry to pre-spaceflight philosophy. {1} claims it helps {4} make sense of the chaos, but\
  \ {6} {8} worries when {2} starts quoting lines about fate and inevitability right before a\
  \ drop. The last thing you want to hear before a firefight is someone musing about existential\
  \ doom.
BOOKWORM.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps a small, battered notebook tucked inside {6} vest.\
  \ It isn''t a journal, and it isn''t for poetry. It''s a list of names - every comrade {2}''s lost,\
  \ every enemy {2}''s killed, every contract that ended in blood. {1} reads it every night,\
  \ whispering each name like a mantra. One day, {2} knows, someone else will be reading {6}.
BOOKWORM.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can fix a supply chain issue in minutes, negotiate a\
  \ contract loophole, and recite the complete corporate history of the Inner Sphere - mostly because\
  \ {2} reads everything. Need a regulation cited or an obscure planetary fact? {0}''s already\
  \ flipping to the right page.
BOOKWORM.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s always reading, but the problem is when.\
  \ Mid-conversation? Eyes still on the book. Being addressed by the commander? "Yeah, yeah, one\
  \ sec." {1}''ll draft an action plan while reading an old science-fiction novel and still do a\
  \ better job than anyone else, but it''s an open question if {2} even knows what planet {2}''s on\
  \ half the time.
BOOKWORM.description.2.SUPPORT={0} reads because {2} has to. {1} studies ancient Terran\
  \ records, disaster reports, the economic collapses of entire planets. {1} says it''s to learn from\
  \ the past, but deep down, {2} knows the truth - history doesn''t repeat, it rhymes. And in this\
  \ business, the verse always ends in war, ruin, and silence.

CALENDAR.label=Keeps a Personal Calendar
CALENDAR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has every mission, training session, and equipment check\
  \ meticulously scheduled. {1} even sets reminders for "Check Ammo Reserves" and "Pre-Battle\
  \ Meditation." {5} {8} laughs at {4} - until they realize {2}''s never the one caught off-guard\
  \ when an op gets moved up at the last minute.
CALENDAR.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s calendar isn''t just for logistics; it''s full of birthdays,\
  \ contract anniversaries, and even the day {2} first met each member of {6} {8}. {1} makes sure\
  \ to slip a small gift or a kind word to comrades on their special days. Some find it endearing,\
  \ others unsettling - because in this line of work, remembering dates also means remembering who\
  \ didn''t make it to the next one.
CALENDAR.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s calendar is obsessive. {1} logs every mission, every\
  \ deployment, every injury. {1} tracks trends - how long the average warrior lasts in the unit; how\
  \ many more battles {6} {8} can take before the odds catch up. {1}''s seen the numbers, and {2}\
  \ knows. There''s a date circled in red, deep in the future. {1} won''t say what it means, but {2}\
  \ checks it every day.
CALENDAR.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s calendar isn''t just personal - it''s the real company\
  \ schedule. Payroll deadlines, JumpShip departures, contract negotiations - {2}''s got it all mapped\
  \ out. If the commander wants to know when they''re leaving, they don''t ask the XO. They ask {0}.
CALENDAR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} believes mercenary life shouldn''t be all death and logistics,\
  \ so {2} makes sure to schedule "Company Movie Night," "Optional Poker Tournament," and\
  \ "Morale-Boosting Happy Hour." Even the gruffest veterans roll their eyes at first - until they\
  \ find themselves actually looking forward to "Trivia Night, Hegemony Edition."
CALENDAR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps a calendar because someone has to. It tells {4} exactly\
  \ when the company''s bank account will run dry, when their Mek will finally wear out, and when\
  \ their contracts will leave them stranded in hostile space. {1} keeps the bad news to {4}self for\
  \ now, but {2}''s already penciled in "Final Dissolution of Unit" just in case.

CANDLES.label=Fond of Scented Candles
CANDLES.description.0.COMBATANT=The repair bays stink of sweat and burnt wiring, the barracks\
  \ always reek of gun oil, and the battlefield is worse. {0} fights the stink of war with an\
  \ arsenal of lavender, sandalwood, and citrus candles. {5} squadmates mock {4} - until they realize\
  \ {6} bunk actually smells nice.
CANDLES.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, {0} lights a small candle in {6}\
  \ quarters or in the corner of a DropShip hangar. It''s always the same scent, something that\
  \ reminds {4} of home - wherever that was. {1} doesn''t talk about it, but those who''ve fought beside\
  \ {4} know: it''s not just a habit. It''s a tether, a way to remind {4}self there''s still a world\
  \ beyond the blood and steel.
CANDLES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to share a tent, a bunk, or a barracks with someone\
  \ who loved scented candles. They''re gone now, but their habit remains. Every time {2} lights one,\
  \ the memory lingers in the air like the smoke curling from the wick - fading, but never truly gone.
CANDLES.description.0.SUPPORT=The company barracks are cold, impersonal, and smell like old\
  \ metal - but not {0}''s office. {5} desk is lined with small candles, filling the air with warm\
  \ vanilla, crisp pine, or exotic spices from some world {2} barely remembers. Even the grizzled\
  \ veterans find themselves stopping by just to breathe for a moment.
CANDLES.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s love for scented candles has nearly gotten {4} banned\
  \ from multiple compounds. Between fire suppression alarms going off and that one time a candle\
  \ nearly ignited a munitions crate, {2}''s been forced to compromise. Now {2} sticks to flameless\
  \ aromatherapy diffusers - but deep down, {2} knows it''s not the same.
CANDLES.description.2.SUPPORT=The scent of blood, burning cities, and melted armor haunt\
  \ {0}''s memories. {1} learned long ago that no amount of scrubbing can erase the past. But a \
  candle - one simple, flickering light - can mask it for just a little while. And when the wax burns\
  \ down to nothing, {2} knows it''s time to light another.

CHEWING_GUM.label=Always Chewing Gum
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions shake the ground, autocannon fire rips through\
  \ cover, and {0} just keeps chewing. {5} {8} swears {2}''s unflappable - always calm, always\
  \ focused, grinding {6} teeth through minty freshness while delivering precise, lethal fire. If\
  \ {0} ever spits {6} gum out in the middle of a fight, then you know things are bad.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether {2}''s gunning down enemy infantry, dodging PPC blasts,\
  \ or lining up a shot, {0}''s always got a smirk and a fresh stick of gum. {1} pops it in like a\
  \ pre-battle ritual, as if to say, This is just another day at the office. And honestly? {1}\
  \ fights like {2} believes it.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t chew gum for fun. {1} chews because if {2} stops,\
  \ {6} jaw clenches, {6} stomach knots, and the ghosts get a little louder. {1}''s tasted blood,\
  \ smoke, and the bitter air of burning cities. But as long as {2}''s chewing, as long as {2}\
  \ focuses on that single, repetitive motion, {2} can pretend - just for a little while - that things\
  \ are normal.
CHEWING_GUM.description.0.SUPPORT={0} juggles manifests, schedules, and disputes all while\
  \ chewing a steady rhythm of bubblegum-flavored efficiency. If {2}''s blowing bubbles in the middle\
  \ of a meeting, it means {2}''s already outmaneuvered the other side.
CHEWING_GUM.description.1.SUPPORT=The constant snapping, popping, and chewing drives half the\
  \ company insane, but {0} refuses to stop. "It helps me focus," {2} says. And, somehow, it does.\
  \ {1}''s the only one who can keep track of deployment schedules, cargo weights, and which planet\
  \ their next contract is on without breaking a sweat.
CHEWING_GUM.description.2.SUPPORT=There''s not much softness in the military life - just rations,\
  \ burnt coffee, and the bitter taste of war. But gum? Gum reminds {0} that there used to be\
  \ shops, vendors, normalcy. Every time {2} unwraps a fresh stick, {2} pretends, for just a second,\
  \ that {2}''s somewhere else. Somewhere safer. Somewhere that still exists.

CHRONIC_LATENESS.label=Chronically Late
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is never on time, but somehow, {2} always shows up just\
  \ when things are about to go south. Whether it''s rolling onto the battlefield in a hail of\
  \ fire, dropping into the fray seconds before an ambush, or sprinting to {6} post as the DropShip\
  \ doors open, {2}''s living proof that "better late than never" sometimes does work.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s alarms are always ignored, {6} comms are always buzzing\
  \ with angry messages, and {2}''s always the last one suited up. No one knows how {2} still manages\
  \ to be an effective warrior, but somehow, {2} gets away with it. The day {6} luck runs out,\
  \ though, is going to be spectacularly bad.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.COMBATANT=No matter how hard {2} tries, {0} is always one step behind.\
  \ {1} arrived late to the briefing where {6} {8} was assigned their final mission. {1} reached\
  \ the rendezvous just in time to see the DropShip leaving without {4}. {1} sprinted to save {6}\
  \ best friend, but by the time {2} got there, the only thing left was blood. {1} keeps running,\
  \ keeps trying - but in the end, {2}''s always too late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is late to everything - staff meetings, supply runs,\
  \ deadlines - but when {2} finally shows up, {2} solves problems like no one else. Need a deadline\
  \ renegotiated? A missing shipment found? A discrepancy fixed? Just give {4} five more minutes\
  \ (or maybe thirty).
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone in the company has learned to lie to {0} about\
  \ meeting times. If the briefing is at 0800, {2}''s told 0730. If a shuttle departs at noon, {2}\
  \ gets an 1130 memo. {1} knows they do this. {1} still manages to be late.
CHRONIC_LATENESS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} wasn''t always this way. {1} used to be punctual, precise.\
  \ But after a while, what''s the point? Military units fall apart, contracts get broken, people\
  \ die. Schedules are just an illusion of control in a universe that doesn''t care. So {0} lets\
  \ the minutes slip by, knowing deep down that, one day, there won''t be any more time left.

CLEANER.label=Compulsive Cleaner
CLEANER.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it''s scrubbing down {6} gear, wiping every speck of dust\
  \ off {6} boots, or meticulously cleaning {6} bunk after a long mission, {0} keeps everything\
  \ spotless. {1} claims that "clean gear is reliable gear," and to {6} credit, {2} looks good.
CLEANER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every mission, {0} polishes {6} sidearm, tightens every\
  \ strap, and scrubs the inside of {6} helmet until it gleams. Some say it''s just ritual; others\
  \ think it''s {6} way of dealing with the chaos of combat. Either way, {6} unit knows that when\
  \ {0} starts cleaning, it''s a sign {2}''s mentally preparing to face hell.
CLEANER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} is constantly wiping down {6} gear, scrubbing {6} hands, and\
  \ sweeping {6} bunk. No matter how much {2} cleans, though, the stains are never really gone. {1}''s\
  \ haunted by the blood {2} couldn''t wash away - whether it''s {6} comrades'', {6} enemies'', or {6}\
  \ own, even {2}''s no longer sure.
CLEANER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s workspace is a model of precision. Tools are perfectly\
  \ arranged, spare parts gleam under harsh lighting, and every surface is dust-free. Anyone who\
  \ messes up {6} spotless system is likely to get a mop shoved into their hands and a long lecture\
  \ on "basic respect for shared spaces."
CLEANER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} can''t stand clutter, grime, or grease stains, which makes {4}\
  \ a constant presence in the repair bay. Whether {2}''s scrubbing someone else''s tools or wiping\
  \ down DropShip corridors, {2}''s always cleaning something - and somehow, that relentless energy\
  \ keeps the whole operation running smoother.
CLEANER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} cleans because it''s the only thing left that {2} can control.\
  \ {1} polishes the windows even though they look out on a dead world. {1} scrubs the briefing table\
  \ even though no one''s gathered around it in weeks. One by one, the others are leaving, dying, or\
  \ simply giving up. {0} just keeps cleaning, as if {2} can scrub away the decay of a company\
  \ that''s already rotting from within.

COLLECTOR.label=Collects Odd Items
COLLECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a knack for finding strange things in the ruins of\
  \ battlefields - enemy insignias, discarded dog tags, fragments of ''Mek armor with odd markings.\
  \ {5} {8} jokes that {2} could start a museum, but they''ve all seen {4} pull out a bent bullet\
  \ casing mid-fight, rub it like a lucky charm, and somehow walk away unscathed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} collects junk. Old playing cards, broken holodisks,\
  \ half-melted action figures. {1} swears each one has a story, even if it''s just "found it in a\
  \ burned-out bunker." Some say it''s a harmless habit, but others worry - because {0} never throws\
  \ anything away, even the stuff that should be forgotten.
COLLECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps a little bag tied inside {6} jacket, filled with\
  \ small trinkets - items {2}''s taken from the dead. A ration tin from a fallen comrade, an enemy\
  \ soldier''s wristwatch, a child''s toy found in the wreckage of a bombed-out city. {1} doesn''t know\
  \ why {2} does it, only that every time {2} loses someone, {2} has to take something to remember\
  \ them. {5} collection keeps growing. It always grows.
COLLECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s supply closet isn''t just stocked with spare parts and\
  \ ammo - it''s got weird stuff. A pre-Hegemony coffee mug, an old recruitment poster, a stuffed\
  \ animal with one button eye. No one knows where {2} gets this junk, but somehow, {2} always has\
  \ exactly what you didn''t realize you needed.
COLLECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} picks up odd relics from every planet the company\
  \ visits - outdated currency, antique tools, even random street signs. "Every piece of junk tells a\
  \ story," {2} says. But when someone asks why {2}''s so obsessed with lost things, {2} just shrugs.\
  \ "If we don''t remember them, who will?"
COLLECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} never leaves a battlefield without taking\
  \ something - sometimes a spent shell casing, sometimes a piece of fabric, sometimes a nameplate\
  \ from a wrecked ''Mek. It started as a way to remember fallen comrades, but now? {1} keeps things\
  \ from everyone - raiders, civilians, people whose names {2} never even knew. {5} collection is a\
  \ graveyard in miniature, and it will never be full.

COMPETITIVE_NATURE.label=Competitive Nature
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} has to win. Whether it''s in\
  \ a bar brawl, a shooting contest, or a live-fire battlefield, {2} takes every engagement as a\
  \ personal challenge. {1}''s the first to volunteer for high-risk missions just to prove {2}''s the\
  \ best. One day, that attitude is going to get {4} killed.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} turns everything into a competition. Who gets the\
  \ most confirmed kills? Who takes out the enemy ''Mek fastest? Who can pee the furthest? If\
  \ there''s a scoreboard, real or imaginary, {0}''s keeping track. {5} {8} puts up with\
  \ it - mostly because, despite all the trash talk, {2} always buys the first round of drinks.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just want to win - {2} needs to. When things\
  \ get desperate, {2} doesn''t hesitate. {1}''ll break rules, take risks no sane person would, leave\
  \ others behind if it means claiming victory. Because in the end, in war, second place is just\
  \ another name for dead.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just file reports - {2} races against {4}self\
  \ to get them done faster than last time. Supply chains? {1} optimizes them like a battlefield\
  \ tactician. Budget allocations? {1} takes bets on how much {2} can shave off unnecessary expenses.\
  \ If you challenge {4} to an efficiency contest, you will lose.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.1.SUPPORT=Poker night? {0} plays to win. PT drills? {1}''ll run\
  \ extra laps just to prove {2} can. Even downtime isn''t safe - {2}''ll challenge you to arm wrestling,\
  \ trivia, or who can drink the most without passing out. The crew loves {4}, but sometimes they\
  \ wish {2}''d let something go just once.
COMPETITIVE_NATURE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} tracks wins and losses, not just {6} own, but\
  \ everyone''s. How many battles won, how many contracts failed, how many comrades lost. {1} used to\
  \ think if {2} could just get ahead, just win enough, it would mean something. But the names on\
  \ the "Losses" side of {6} ledger keep growing, and {2}''s starting to realize - maybe, in this life,\
  \ nobody really wins.

COMPLIMENTS.label=Excessive Complimenter
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} showers {6} teammates with praise, whether they just\
  \ pulled off a perfect ambush or simply reloaded their weapon without a jam. "Great shot! Perfect\
  \ footwork! Love the way you took cover behind that debris, textbook execution!" {1}''s genuine\
  \ about it too - maybe too genuine. Even the most hardened veterans aren''t sure how to respond when\
  \ {2} compliments their "exceptional battlefield posture."
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Enemy forces closing in? {0} still finds time to compliment\
  \ someone for their "magnificent trigger discipline" or the team''s scout for "nailing that\
  \ stealthy approach." Some think it''s just {6} way of keeping morale up. Others think {2}''s\
  \ stalling, trying to keep {4}self from processing the violence happening around {4}.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s compliments aren''t just encouragement. They''re last\
  \ words in disguise. {1} wants the last thing someone hears before they die to be something good.\
  \ {5} {8} knows that when {2} stops fighting to say, "You really handled that situation well,"\
  \ it means {2} doesn''t think they''re making it out alive.
COMPLIMENTS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} thinks everyone is amazing. The way the MekTechs replace\
  \ a fusion engine? "Brilliant." The way the warriors dock their Mek? "Precision work." The way\
  \ the cook managed to make ration packs almost edible? "A culinary triumph." {1} hands out praise\
  \ so fast and frequently that no one''s sure if {2}''s being sarcastic - but {2}''s absolutely serious.
COMPLIMENTS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} can make even the most jaded warriors uncomfortable with\
  \ {6} relentless positivity. Military companies are built on cynicism, but {0}? {0} will\
  \ look a tired, underpaid, underappreciated AsTech dead in the eye and say, "You''re the backbone\
  \ of this operation. Without you, we''re nothing." And damn it - sometimes that''s exactly what they\
  \ need to hear.
COMPLIMENTS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} gives compliments like {6} life depends on it. Maybe, in a\
  \ way, it does. {1} wants to believe that if {2} acknowledges every small act of skill, courage, or\
  \ kindness, it matters. That in a universe of endless war and forgotten lives, someone''s efforts\
  \ will be seen. Because if they aren''t, if people are just lost and unremembered - then what was\
  \ the point of it all?

DAYDREAMER.label=Prone to Daydreaming
DAYDREAMER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a habit of staring off into the distance, lost in\
  \ thoughts of battlefield maneuvers and hypothetical scenarios. "What if we used a pincer\
  \ formation, but with jump-capable units repositioning mid-battle?" {2} mutters, mid-firefight.\
  \ {5} ideas are often brilliant - if only {2}''d stop zoning out long enough to share them before\
  \ bullets start flying.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} fights because {2} has to, but {6} mind is always\
  \ elsewhere - strolling through the jungles of some uncharted world, watching the sunrise over a\
  \ crystalline ocean, or fighting through a battlefield that isn''t real, where no one dies and\
  \ every shot is just for sport. War has a way of pulling {4} back to reality, violently.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} spends more and more time staring into nothing, lost in\
  \ memories of places {2}''s never been, people {2}''s never met. {1} flinches at explosions a little\
  \ less than {2} used to. {1} doesn''t even notice the warnings blaring in {6} HUD anymore. One day,\
  \ {2} won''t snap back at all - {6} mind will keep drifting while {6} body is torn apart by war.
DAYDREAMER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is great at {6} job - when {2} remembers {2} has one. One\
  \ second, {2}''s calculating JumpShip fuel reserves; the next, {2}''s staring at a loading crane,\
  \ imagining how much more efficient it would be if they redesigned the entire docking system.\
  \ Someone usually has to snap {4} out of it before {2} redesigns the payroll system instead.
DAYDREAMER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} dreams of things beyond war: a better future, a life\
  \ outside of contracts and bloodshed, a world where people don''t have to sell their lives for\
  \ money. {1} writes down these ideas in an old, worn notebook. No one knows if {2} actually\
  \ believes in them, or if it''s just a way to distract {4}self from the reality of {6} work.
DAYDREAMER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} reads old records, stories of lost worlds, of cities\
  \ untouched by war, of a time when life wasn''t dictated by strategy and firepower. {1} dreams\
  \ about them, too - vivid, detailed dreams that feel more real than the dim, gray present. Maybe\
  \ it''s just escapism. Or maybe, deep down, {2} knows {2} was born in the wrong century, and this\
  \ war-torn existence was never meant for {4}.

DOODLER.label=Compulsive Doodler
DOODLER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s field manual is covered in scribbles - little sketches of\
  \ battle formations, enemy ''Mek silhouettes, and doodled maps of planets {2}''s never even been\
  \ to. {5} commanders are annoyed, but {6} {8} swears that more than once, one of {0}''s\
  \ absentminded sketches ended up being the key to surviving an operation.
DOODLER.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s war journal is supposed to be for mission notes, but it''s\
  \ filled with sketches of things not on the battlefield: towering trees from some distant world,\
  \ the face of a woman {2} can''t quite remember, the endless stars above the DropShip bay. Maybe {2}\
  \ fights so one day {2} won''t have to anymore.
DOODLER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} fills every spare scrap of paper with drawings - names carved\
  \ into ruined buildings, faces half-remembered, insignias from units that no longer exist. {1}\
  \ says {2} draws so {2} won''t forget, but the way {2} looks at {6} sketches, like {2}''s haunted by\
  \ them... maybe {2} already has.
DOODLER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s official reports always come back with little sketches in\
  \ the margins - better weapon mounting brackets, new DropShip layouts, a completely redesigned\
  \ coolant system. Some of {6} ideas are insane. Some get implemented. The tech crews have learned\
  \ to always check {6} notes
DOODLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Briefings, budget reviews, deployment schedules - {0} listens,\
  \ technically, but {6} notepad is always filled with little cartoons of {6} comrades, absurdly\
  \ detailed ''Mek drawings, or a sketch of the commander looking way too serious. Half the company\
  \ keeps {6} doodles as personal trophies.
DOODLER.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s doodles have changed. Once, they were harmless, funny little\
  \ scribbles. Now, they''re battlefields reduced to smoldering craters, Mek collapsing in fire,\
  \ DropShips breaking apart in orbit. When asked about them, {2} just shrugs. "I don''t know," {2}\
  \ says. "Sometimes I feel like I''m just drawing what''s going to happen."

DOOLITTLE.label=Talks to Animals
DOOLITTLE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} will stop mid-patrol to have a full conversation with a\
  \ local stray or a scavenger bird perched on a ruined building. {5} {8} teases {4} for it - until\
  \ a pack of giant canines doesn''t attack them, or an avian swarm takes off suddenly, giving {4}\
  \ just enough warning before an ambush. Maybe {0}''s just lucky. Or maybe the animals know\
  \ something the rest of them don''t.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t care much for the politics and ego battles of\
  \ military life. {1}''s more comfortable talking to a DropShip''s cat or a bunker rat than {6}\
  \ commanding officer. "Animals don''t lie, and they don''t stab you in the back for a bigger\
  \ payday," {2} says. "You could learn a thing or two from ''em."
DOOLITTLE.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s seen too many comrades die. {1}''s stopped trying to make\
  \ real connections with people - they never last. But animals? They don''t ask questions. They don''t\
  \ make promises they can''t keep. And when {0} whispers to a half-starved dog before a\
  \ firefight, telling it to run and hide, it''s not because {2}''s worried about the mutt. It''s\
  \ because, deep down, {2} knows it''ll outlive {4}.
DOOLITTLE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} talks to every animal that wanders into camp - whether it''s a\
  \ lizard sunning itself on a crate or a cargo bay rat sneaking rations. {1}''s the reason the\
  \ company somehow has a "mascot," even though nobody remembers adopting it.
DOOLITTLE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} insists animals understand {4}. The company''s techs were\
  \ skeptical - until {2} got a half-feral warehouse dog to stop stealing rations, or convinced a\
  \ colony of birds to roost outside the DropShip''s exhaust ports instead of inside them. No one\
  \ knows how {2} does it, but it''s saved them a lot of maintenance hours.
DOOLITTLE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has a habit of talking to stray animals like they''re the\
  \ only ones who really understand {4}. {1} says things to them {2}''d never admit to another\
  \ human - {6} fears, {6} regrets, the things {2}''s seen that still keep {4} up at night. "At least\
  \ you won''t lie to me," {2} mutters to a one-eyed cat. It just stares at {4}, unblinking, as if it\
  \ knows.

DRAMATIC.label=Overly Dramatic
DRAMATIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never just reloads - {2} flourishes like {2}''s starring in a war\
  \ epic. {1} doesn''t dive for cover, {2} hurls {4}self into it. Every fight is a set piece, every\
  \ victory a monologue waiting to happen. {5} {8} rolls their eyes, but they have to admit - when\
  \ {2} pulls off a perfectly timed, slow-motion explosion escape, it''s damn impressive.
DRAMATIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} describes battle like it''s high art. "The PPC arcs like a\
  \ comet''s tail, marking the end of an enemy''s story," {2} mutters over comms. "The battlefield\
  \ sings with the percussion of autocannons and missile strikes." {5} {8} just wants {4} to call\
  \ the damn targets, but {2}''s too busy turning war into a performance.
DRAMATIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} plays a role. {1} wants {6} last stand\
  \ to be legendary, {6} name whispered in hushed tones long after {2}''s gone. If {2} falls, it has\
  \ to be in a blaze of glory, outnumbered but never outmatched. The problem is... war doesn''t care\
  \ about theatrics. And no one remembers the dead the way they think they will.
DRAMATIC.description.0.SUPPORT="Ah, once again we are denied the spare fusion engines we so\
  \ desperately need! Shall we resign ourselves to ICEs, or dare we defy fate and improvise?" {0}\
  \ narrates every minor setback like it''s a Shakespearean tragedy. Somehow, the sheer absurdity of\
  \ it makes the bureaucracy almost tolerable.
DRAMATIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just deliver status reports - {2} performs them. {1}\
  \ gestures wildly, paces like a stage actor, and gasps in mock horror at every budget cut. The\
  \ higher-ups are exasperated, but {6} dramatic delivery actually keeps people awake during\
  \ meetings, so they tolerate {4}. Barely.
DRAMATIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} speaks in grand, sweeping terms because {2} knows the truth:\
  \ in war, most lives are forgotten, reduced to a footnote in someone else''s report. {1} refuses to\
  \ let that happen. {1} remembers the dead, tells their stories, makes their sacrifices matter.\
  \ Even if no one listens. Even if, in the end, {2}''ll be forgotten too.

EATING_HABITS.label=Unpredictable Eating Habits
EATING_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} will go an entire day without eating, only to inhale\
  \ three full MREs right before a drop. Sometimes, {2} forgets to eat at all, other times, {2}''s\
  \ gnawing on a ration bar mid-firefight. {5} {8} has stopped questioning it - except for the time\
  \ {2} casually sipped a protein shake while under heavy fire.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT=One day, {0} is choking down cold canned meat in a muddy\
  \ foxhole like everyone else. The next, {2}''s somehow managed to sear a cut of unknown protein\
  \ over an engine vent and is sprinkling scavenged spices on it. "Eat well when you can," {2} says,\
  \ as if anyone else has time for battlefield fine dining.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} either forgets to eat for days or devours everything in\
  \ sight, like {2}''s afraid there won''t be another meal. {1} doesn''t talk about it, but those who\
  \ know {4} well suspect {2}''s been through famine, blockade, or a siege. {1} never wastes food. {1}\
  \ never complains about rations. Because {2} remembers when there wasn''t anything to eat at all.
EATING_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} tracks every supply shipment, fuel order, and ration\
  \ count with precision - yet somehow, {2} always forgets to eat {4}self. It''s not uncommon to find\
  \ {4} gnawing on a stale protein bar at 3 AM while recalculating fuel logistics, as if {2} just\
  \ remembered that human beings require sustenance.
EATING_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT=One day, {0} is eating gourmet-grade imported beef from a\
  \ high-end merchant. The next, {2}''s happily spooning up a cold can of something labeled only as\
  \ "Meat Product." Nobody can predict what {2}''ll eat next, and at this point, no one dares try.
EATING_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} eats like someone who''s seen real hunger. {1} never\
  \ throws food away, never turns down a meal, and has a habit of keeping emergency rations even\
  \ when food is plentiful. Sometimes, {2} chews slower, as if trying to make each bite last,\
  \ staring at {6} plate like {2}''s seeing something the rest of them can''t - like {2}''s remembering.

ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.label=Extreme Environmental Sensitivity
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it''s too hot, too cold, too humid, or too\
  \ dry, {0} will let you know. "I swear, this desert heat is melting me." "This jungle humidity\
  \ is literally trying to kill me." Yet, despite {6} endless gripes about the conditions, {2}''s\
  \ still right there in the thick of it, fighting like hell. Complaining is just part of {6}\
  \ battlefield routine.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} is miserable in extreme conditions, but {2}\
  \ always finds ways to cope. On an ice world? {1}''s hoarding heat packs in {6} boots. Stuck in a\
  \ dust storm? {1}''s wearing a scarf like some kind of post-apocalyptic bandit. {5} ability to\
  \ adapt is almost as impressive as {6} ability to suffer loudly.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.COMBATANT=Every harsh wind feels like the bite of an old\
  \ wound. Every humid jungle reminds {4} of the infections {2} barely survived. Every freezing\
  \ night brings back the ghost of near-hypothermia. {0}''s body has been through hell, and now it\
  \ feels every shift in the weather like a lingering punishment.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has a personal grudge against the entire\
  \ Inner Sphere. "This world is too dusty." "This one has toxic rain." "This one? Too much\
  \ gravity." {1}''s a professional, but the moment {2} steps outside a temperature-controlled\
  \ building, {2}''s loudly questioning why anyone thought this planet was worth fighting for.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a personal stash of climate-control\
  \ gear that would make a survivalist jealous. Cooling vests, heated socks, humidifiers,\
  \ dehumidifiers - if there''s a way to mitigate discomfort, {2} has it. {1}''s always prepared, and if\
  \ you forgot to bring gloves to an ice world, you might be able to borrow some... for a price.
ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSITIVITY.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s body isn''t built for this life. Every\
  \ drop in temperature burns {6} nerves. Every breath of thin atmosphere makes {6} lungs scream.\
  \ Every exposure to a new planet''s toxic pollen, biting cold, or acidic rain grinds {4} down.\
  \ The universe is harsh, and {0} feels every bit of it. One day, {6} body just won''t adapt\
  \ anymore.

EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.label=Excessive Caution
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0.COMBATANT={0} double-checks everything. {5} {8} rolls their\
  \ eyes when {2} insists on inspecting {6} gear one more time before deployment, but {6} weapon\
  \ never jams. {1} never walks into an ambush, never gets caught off guard - and when {2} tells the\
  \ unit, "Something doesn''t feel right," they''ve learned to listen.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1.COMBATANT={0} refuses to rush. Every movement in combat is\
  \ deliberate, every approach is scouted, and every plan has a contingency. {5} unit grumbles when\
  \ {2} insists on re-checking their escape route for the third time - but when the first two go bad,\
  \ they don''t complain anymore.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2.COMBATANT={0} survives. {1}''s survived everything. {1} never\
  \ charges in, never takes unnecessary risks, never makes the fatal mistakes {6} comrades do. But\
  \ survival comes at a cost - {2}''s always the one left standing, always the one pulling bodies from\
  \ wreckage, always the one left to bury the dead. {1} wonders if, one day, caution won''t be enough.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.0.SUPPORT={0} plans for every possible scenario. Need backup\
  \ rations? Already stocked. Emergency medical supplies? Got ''em. Redundant power systems?\
  \ Installed last week. Some say {2}''s paranoid - until the day things go wrong, and {2}''s the only\
  \ reason they survive.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.1.SUPPORT={0} refuses to sign off on anything until {2}''s read\
  \ every contract clause, cross-checked the budget, and confirmed the supplier''s reputation. It\
  \ makes things excruciatingly slow, but it also means the company never gets scammed, shorted, or\
  \ stuck with defective equipment.
EXCESSIVE_CAUTION.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just cautious - {2}''s aware. {1} sees the cracks\
  \ forming before anyone else does. {1} knows when a company is running on borrowed time, when a\
  \ contract is one mistake away from turning into a death sentence. {1} doesn''t panic, doesn''t\
  \ shout - {2} just watches, silent and grim, waiting for the inevitable collapse.

EXCESSIVE_GREETING.label=Over-the-Top Greetings
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.COMBATANT=Whether it''s a battlefield check-in or a casual\
  \ encounter in the barracks, {0} never greets anyone normally. "Ah-ha! My favorite sniper,\
  \ still breathing, I see!" "BEHOLD, THE ACE MEKJOCK RETURNS FROM ANOTHER GLORIOUS VICTORY!" Even\
  \ in the middle of combat, {2}''ll key {6} comm just to yell, "GOOD MORNING, YOU MAGNIFICENT\
  \ BASTARDS!" It''s impossible to ignore {4} - and, admittedly, hard to feel unappreciated.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.COMBATANT={0} treats every greeting like a full-scale reunion.\
  \ Even if {2} saw you five minutes ago, {2}''ll wave both arms, slap you on the back, and shout your\
  \ name like you''ve been missing for years. It''s ridiculous - but in a profession where people do\
  \ disappear forever, nobody minds hearing, "Well, look who''s still alive! Damn good to see ya!"
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} greets everyone like they''re {6} long-lost best\
  \ friend, because deep down, {2} knows - they might be gone tomorrow. {1}''s seen too many empty\
  \ bunks, too many callsigns go silent, too many comrades blown apart mid-sentence. So {2} greets\
  \ everyone like it''s the last time {2}''ll ever get the chance. Because someday, it will be.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.0.SUPPORT=Walk into the depot, and you will be greeted. Loudly.\
  \ "Ah-HA! The HERO of the battlefield RETURNS to my humble domain! What grand treasures do you\
  \ seek today, O Mighty Warrior?" It''s impossible to take {4} seriously - but it''s also impossible\
  \ to leave in a bad mood.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just greet people, {2} performs an\
  \ introduction. Whether it''s an exaggerated bow, a dramatic handshake, or an entire impromptu \
  speech about your accomplishments, {2} somehow turns entering a room into an event. The commander\
  \ tried to make {4} stop - until even the most exhausted warriors admitted they kind of liked it.
EXCESSIVE_GREETING.description.2.SUPPORT=Sometimes, {0} slips up. {1} greets people who aren''t\
  \ there anymore. "Jenkins! Damn good to see you!" Only to be met with silence, an empty bunk, or\
  \ a blank stare from someone who remembers Jenkins died last month. {1} laughs it off, pretends\
  \ it didn''t happen. But deep down, {2} knows - one day, someone else is going to do the same thing\
  \ to {6} empty bunk.

EYE_CONTACT.label=Maintains Intense Eye Contact
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just look at people - {2} locks on like a targeting\
  \ system. Enemy lining up a shot? {1} stares them down through the HUD like {2} dares them to miss.\
  \ Comrade panicking under fire? {1} grips their shoulder and holds their gaze until they snap out\
  \ of it. {5} stare isn''t just intense - it''s commanding.
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether {2}''s giving orders, lining up a shot, or listening to a\
  \ mission briefing, {0} does not blink. {5} {8} jokes that {2} doesn''t need targeting\
  \ computers - {2} just looks at a target long enough and the shot finds its mark. It''d be impressive\
  \ if it weren''t so unsettling.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s stare is hollow, deep, wrong. {1} looks through people,\
  \ past them, as if {2}''s seeing something beyond the present moment. It''s like {2} already knows\
  \ how this battle will end - how everyone''s battle will end. And when {2} looks at you too long, you\
  \ start to wonder... does {2} see your fate, too?
EYE_CONTACT.description.0.SUPPORT=Trying to get extra rations? Claiming you never got issued ammo?\
  \ {0} doesn''t even need to check the manifest. {1} just stares at you, silent, waiting. Within\
  \ seconds, most people break down and confess. "Okay, fine, I did take an extra case of heat\
  \ sinks. Just stop looking at me like that."
EYE_CONTACT.description.1.SUPPORT=A casual chat with {0} is anything but casual. {1} maintains\
  \ direct, unwavering eye contact the entire time, no matter how mundane the topic. Whether {2}''s\
  \ talking about supply shipments or asking if you''ve eaten today, it always feels like {2}''s\
  \ staring into your soul.
EYE_CONTACT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just look at people - {2} memorizes them. The shape\
  \ of their scars, the flicker of hesitation in their voice, the way they tense when discussing\
  \ past battles. It''s not just observation; it''s cataloging. Because {0} knows that in a\
  \ military unit, faces disappear. And someone has to remember them.

FASHION_CHOICES.label=Eccentric Fashion Choices
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.COMBATANT=While the rest of the {8} sticks to standard-issue gear,\
  \ {0} finds ways to stand out. Maybe it''s a bright red scarf tied around {6} combat armor, a\
  \ custom-painted helmet with flair, or a ridiculous pair of aviator shades that {2} insists\
  \ improve {6} targeting. {1} fights just as hard as anyone else, but {2}''ll damned if {2} does it\
  \ without style.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has one piece of gear {2} refuses to part with - an old\
  \ leather jacket, a neon-colored sash, or maybe a battered hula girl that somehow survived a\
  \ cockpit ejection. {1} claims it''s lucky. {5} {8} claims it''s a liability. But after seeing {4}\
  \ walk away from three near-death situations, nobody tells {4} to take it off anymore.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s patches don''t match. {5} gear is a mix of different\
  \ uniforms, scavenged from fallen mercs, lost comrades, or abandoned battlefields. {1} says it''s\
  \ "just practical." But every piece has a name behind it, a story {2} won''t tell. And when {2}\
  \ gears up, {2}''s not just wearing armor - {2}''s carrying ghosts.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.0.SUPPORT=Everyone else in the company wears standard fatigues. {0}?\
  \ {0} struts around the hangar in a velvet waistcoat, a brightly patterned scarf, or a jumpsuit\
  \ covered in custom patches from a dozen different mercenary outfits. {1} argues that if {2} has to\
  \ run support for a bunch of killers, {2} might as well look good doing it.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s wardrobe is a mystery. One day, {2}''s in a full\
  \ Hegemony officer''s coat (with no explanation). The next, {2}''s wearing knee-high boots and a\
  \ flamboyant sash like {2}''s leading a parade. The only constant is that no one ever sees {4} wear\
  \ the same outfit twice. Where does {2} get this stuff? No one knows.
FASHION_CHOICES.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s clothes don''t fit the war-torn world {2} lives in.\
  \ {5} coats are pristine, {6} accessories impractical, {6} boots polished like {2}''s about to\
  \ attend a grand ball instead of supporting a military unit. {1} dresses like {2}''s from a world\
  \ that hasn''t existed in centuries - as if, by refusing to acknowledge reality, {2} can pretend it\
  \ still does.

FIDGETS.label=Constantly Fidgeting
FIDGETS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is always moving - tapping {6} fingers on {6} rifle, adjusting\
  \ {6} gloves, shifting {6} stance even when in cover. {5} {8} used to think {2} was anxious, but\
  \ no - this is just how {2} operates. {1} says {2} fights better when {2}''s in motion. And judging by\
  \ {6} reaction time, {2} might actually be right.
FIDGETS.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s knee bounces when {2}''s on a stakeout. {5} hands tap rhythms\
  \ when {2}''s waiting to drop. {5} fingers drum against {6} sidearm before a fight. Some say it''s\
  \ nerves, some say it''s a bad habit - but whatever it is, it''s impossible to ignore. {5} {8}\
  \ isn''t sure if it makes {4} more dangerous, or if one day, {2}''s just going to snap.
FIDGETS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} fidgets because if {2} stops moving, {6} hands remember. They\
  \ remember the recoil of every shot, the weight of a dying friend, the texture of dried blood\
  \ under {6} nails. {1} plays with {6} gear, taps {6} fingers, shifts {6} stance - not because {2}''s\
  \ impatient, but because stillness brings memories, and memories are worse than war.
FIDGETS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is always doing something, even when {2} doesn''t need to be. If\
  \ {2}''s talking to you, {2}''s also reorganizing crates, flipping a pen between {6} fingers, or\
  \ double-checking inventory counts that don''t actually need to be checked. {1} calls it "efficient\
  \ multitasking." Everyone else calls it "exhausting to watch."
FIDGETS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t attend briefings so much as survive them. {1} taps on\
  \ tables, spins a data slate in {6} hands, or starts disassembling and reassembling whatever\
  \ piece of equipment is within reach. {1} swears it helps {4} focus, but more than once, a\
  \ commander has had to stop mid-sentence to tell {4} to put that back together.
FIDGETS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps {6} hands busy, always. If {2}''s moving, if {2}''s doing\
  \ something, then maybe {2} won''t think about how many people {2}''s seen walk to their death, how\
  \ many jobs {2}''s approved that led to ruin, how many times {2}''s signed off on death orders\
  \ disguised as payroll. {5} hands shake when they''re empty, so {2} makes sure they never are.

FITNESS.label=Extreme Personal Fitness Routine
FITNESS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just stay in shape - {2} pushes {4}self beyond reason.\
  \ If the {8} is running drills, {2}''s doing extra laps. If they''re training, {2}''s doing push-ups\
  \ between maneuvers. {1} treats {6} body like a weapon, and {2}''s determined to keep it sharpened\
  \ at all times.
FITNESS.description.1.COMBATANT=If {0} can do something in a harder, more exhausting way, {2}\
  \ will. {1} sprints to {6} ''Mek instead of walking, does pull-ups on a DropShip''s cargo racks, and\
  \ somehow turns reloading a missile rack into a full-body workout. "Gotta stay combat-ready," {2}\
  \ says, between sets of one-arm push-ups.
FITNESS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} trains like a man trying to break {4}self. {1} pushes through\
  \ injuries, ignores exhaustion, and punishes {6} body like it owes {4} something. Maybe {2}''s\
  \ trying to outlast the war, or maybe {2}''s just waiting for the day {6} body finally gives\
  \ out - because {2} knows the battlefield won''t do it cleanly.
FITNESS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} may work support, but {2}''s built like an elite commando. {1}\
  \ wakes up before the MekWarriors to train, runs extra PT drills, and somehow convinces\
  \ maintenance crews to do push-ups while waiting for system diagnostics. {1} insists it''s just a\
  \ hobby, but when {2} casually deadlifts a supply crate meant for two people, no one''s sure\
  \ anymore.
FITNESS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} turns everything into exercise. Organizing inventory? {1}\
  \ carries two crates at once for the added resistance. Long-haul travel on a JumpShip? {1}''s doing\
  \ bodyweight workouts in zero-G. If {2}''s standing still, {2}''s probably clenching {6} abs just to\
  \ make sure {2}''s "maximizing muscle engagement."
FITNESS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} trains like a man expecting the worst. Even though {2} runs\
  \ support, {2} preps like {2}''ll be the last line of defense. {5} body is covered in\
  \ micro-injuries, stress fractures, and old bruises that never heal right. {1} says {2} just "likes\
  \ to stay in shape." But {6} eyes say {2}''s afraid of what''ll happen if {2} ever stops.

FIXATES.label=Fixates on One Topic
FIXATES.description.0.COMBATANT=Once {0} gets an idea in {6} head, nothing will get {4} to drop\
  \ it. If {2}''s convinced a flanking maneuver is the best strategy, {2}''ll argue about it until\
  \ deployment. If {2} thinks a certain ''Mek loadout is ideal, {2}''ll lecture anyone who''ll listen.\
  \ Sometimes it''s annoying - but sometimes, {2}''s right.
FIXATES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has a special interest, and by God, you will hear about it.\
  \ Maybe it''s the history of a specific battle, maybe it''s the aerodynamics of autocannon rounds,\
  \ maybe it''s the exact specifications of every BattleMek ever made. Whatever it is, once {2}\
  \ starts talking, there''s no stopping {4}.
FIXATES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} latches onto a topic with desperation. {1} throws {4}self into\
  \ technical specs, tactics, anything that keeps {6} mind from wandering. {1} knows if {2} stops\
  \ thinking about this, {2}''ll start thinking about everything else - the battles {2}''s lost, the\
  \ friends who never made it back, the creeping realization that fighting never really ends.
FIXATES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has one passion: streamlining supply chains. {1} has charts. {1}\
  \ has diagrams. {1}''s written essays about how they could shave seconds off deployment times. The\
  \ company''s operations have never been smoother - but dear God, someone please get {4} to talk\
  \ about anything else.
FIXATES.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where a conversation starts, {0} will bring it back to\
  \ {6} chosen topic. "Oh, you''re talking about planetary weather patterns? That reminds me of how\
  \ desert conditions affect ''Mek heat sinks!" No one knows how {2} does it. No one wants {4} to do\
  \ it.
FIXATES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} fixates because if {2} doesn''t, {6} mind starts wandering to\
  \ places it shouldn''t. It''s easier to focus on logistics, or ''Mek classifications, or the finer\
  \ points of battlefield tactics than to acknowledge what {2}''s really doing - desperately clinging\
  \ to one thing in a universe that''s constantly tearing everything else away.

FLASK.label=Carries a Flask
FLASK.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s flask isn''t just for drinking - it''s ritual. A sip before\
  \ battle for luck, a sip after for survival. {1} swears it keeps {4} steady, keeps the nerves from\
  \ creeping in. {5} {8} jokes that {2}''s pickling {4}self so {2} can live forever.
FLASK.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s flask is always full, and {2}''s always willing to pass it\
  \ around. Before a mission, after a mission, in the middle of one if things are slow enough.\
  \ "Nothing wrong with a quick sip," {2} says, handing it over with a grin. No one''s sure if it''s\
  \ actual alcohol, battlefield coffee, or something worse - but whatever it is, it burns.
FLASK.description.2.COMBATANT={0} drinks because if {2} doesn''t, the memories come crawling back.\
  \ The faces of the dead, the screams over comms, the way burning metal smells just like burning\
  \ flesh. {1}''s not drinking to get drunk - {2}''s drinking to function. The flask is always with {4}.\
  \ It has to be. Because the moment it''s empty, the past comes rushing in.
FLASK.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s flask isn''t just for {4}self - it''s for everyone. {1}''s got a\
  \ special reserve for MekWarriors after a hard fight, a backup stash for celebrating a rare win,\
  \ and a hidden emergency bottle for when things really go to hell. {5} philosophy? A military\
  \ unit runs on money, ammo, and just enough booze to keep people sane.
FLASK.description.1.SUPPORT="It''s just for the nerves," {0} says, casually taking a sip while\
  \ filing requests. "Good for circulation." {1}''s got an excuse for every situation - cold weather,\
  \ bad food, long meetings. If {2} ever actually ran out, the entire admin staff would probably\
  \ collapse from shock.
FLASK.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t drink for fun. {1} drinks because {2} made choices - signed\
  \ orders that got people killed, approved supply runs that never made it back, trusted the wrong\
  \ people. The flask is {6} way of forgetting, if only for a moment. But no matter how much {2}\
  \ drinks, the ledger never ba{8}s.

FOOT_TAPPER.label=Always Tapping Foot
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s foot is always tapping - against the floor of the\
  \ DropShip, against the dirt in a trench, against the side of an ammo crate during a briefing.\
  \ It''s like {2}''s waiting for something to happen, like {2}''s just a half-second away from bolting\
  \ into action. {5} {8} has learned that when {0}''s foot stops tapping, that''s when things are\
  \ about to get serious.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t sit still. {5} foot taps because {6} whole body\
  \ wants to move. {1}''s the first one geared up, the first one out the DropShip, and the first one\
  \ pushing the pace in an assault. When {2}''s forced to wait, {2} gets jittery, practically\
  \ vibrating with impatience. "Hurry up and get to the shooting part," {2} mutters, tapping away.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s foot taps to a rhythm that no one else can hear. Maybe\
  \ it''s an old war march, maybe it''s the echoes of battles past, or maybe it''s just {6} way of\
  \ staying present. {1} doesn''t talk about it, but some nights, when everything is quiet, {2}''s\
  \ still tapping. Like {2}''s counting down to something only {2} knows is coming.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s foot taps as {2} calculates supply orders, budget\
  \ projections, and shipment schedules in real-time. It''s like {6} brain is moving too fast for\
  \ {6} body to keep up. The tapping isn''t impatience - it''s momentum. {1}''s already thinking about\
  \ the next problem before anyone else even realizes there is one.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.1.SUPPORT=The tapping never stops. Boardroom table? Tap tap tap. Cargo bay\
  \ inspection? Tap tap tap. Even when {2}''s standing still, the sound of {6} boot against the deck\
  \ is constant. No one knows if {2}''s nervous, bored, or just wired differently - but after a while,\
  \ people start tapping along without realizing it.
FOOT_TAPPER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} taps {6} foot to remind {4}self {2}''s alive. That {2}''s\
  \ still moving, still breathing, still part of this world. Some nights, after too many bad\
  \ missions, {2} has to force {6} foot to tap - because if it stops, even for a second, {2}''s afraid\
  \ {2} won''t be able to start it again.

FORGETFUL.label=Chronically Forgetful
FORGETFUL.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is a solid fighter, but damn if {2} doesn''t always forget\
  \ something before a mission. Harness? Left it in the barracks. Comms check? Oops. Forgot to eat\
  \ before deployment? Absolutely. {5} {8} has learned to double-check {6} gear along with their\
  \ own because, sooner or later, {0} is going to pat {4}self down and go, "Wait... where''s my\
  \ sidearm?"
FORGETFUL.description.1.COMBATANT={0} remembers battle tactics, enemy weak points, and how to\
  \ compensate for environmental conditions perfectly. But ask {4} what day it is? Who they''re\
  \ fighting this week? Whether or not {2} ate before a mission? Gone. {5} mind is laser-focused on\
  \ combat, but the second they get back to base, {2}''s back to asking, "Wait, what planet is this\
  \ again?"
FORGETFUL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t forget because {2}''s careless. {1} forgets because\
  \ {6} head is already full - full of old battlefields, old mistakes, old names. There''s only so\
  \ much room in a person''s memory, and {0} made a choice long ago: {2}''ll never forget the\
  \ fallen, even if it means losing everything else.
FORGETFUL.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is great at managing supplies. {1} remembers critical\
  \ shipment schedules, high-priority requests, and budget restrictions flawlessly. But somehow, {2}\
  \ always forgets one thing - sometimes minor, sometimes catastrophic. "Oh, we were supposed to\
  \ order coolant last cycle? Uh... whoops."
FORGETFUL.description.1.SUPPORT={0} forgets names, times, and occasionally {6} own job title,\
  \ but somehow, the company still runs. {1} keeps the entire operation afloat through sheer\
  \ instinct, despite being the guy who asks, "Wait, did I eat today?" while running inventory\
  \ checks.
FORGETFUL.description.2.SUPPORT=At first, {0} just forgot little things - dates, meetings, faces.\
  \ Then it got worse. Entire conversations lost. Mission details slipping. A comrade''s name, right\
  \ on the tip of {6} tongue, but... gone. {1} laughs it off, pretends it''s nothing, but deep down, {2}\
  \ knows: one day, {2}''s going to forget something that really matters. Maybe {2} already has.

FORMAL_SPEECH.label=Overly Formal Speech
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT={0} delivers battlefield reports like {2}''s speaking in a\
  \ royal court. "Sir, I must inform you that our current tactical position is most untenable." {5}\
  \ {8} has given up trying to get {4} to talk like a normal human being, and at this point, they\
  \ just roll with it.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT={0} insists on addressing even {6} closest comrades as\
  \ "Lieutenant," "Sergeant," or "esteemed colleague." No one knows if it''s a quirk, a joke, or if\
  \ {2} actually thinks they''re all attending a formal gala instead of wading through battlefield\
  \ wreckage. Either way, it makes war sound bizarrely polite.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT={0} speaks like a man out of time, using words and phrases\
  \ that no one else does anymore. Maybe it''s because {2} came from somewhere refined. Maybe it''s a\
  \ desperate attempt to hold on to a piece of {4}self before war grinds {4} into dust like\
  \ everyone else. Or maybe... {2} knows that once {2} stops speaking this way, there''ll be nothing\
  \ left of the person {2} used to be.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s supply reports don''t just list numbers - they tell a\
  \ story. "It is with deep regret that I must inform you that our reserve ammunition stocks have\
  \ dwindled to perilous levels, necessitating swift resupply lest we court catastrophe." The\
  \ commander sighs, but at least someone in the unit is keeping things interesting.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just give briefings. {1} delivers them with the\
  \ gravitas of a statesman addressing a planetary congress. "Honored comrades, we find ourselves\
  \ at a most critical juncture in our fiscal projections." Everyone wishes {2}''d just say they''re\
  \ running low on cash, but at least it makes budget meetings marginally less soul-crushing.
FORMAL_SPEECH.description.2.SUPPORT={0} speaks with eloquence and grace because someone has to.\
  \ The universe is brutal, war is endless, and civility is dying. If {2} starts talking like the\
  \ rest of them - cold, clipped, brutal - then what''s left? Just another gun for hire, another cog in\
  \ the war machine. {1} refuses. Even if it makes {4} sound ridiculous, {2} refuses.

FURNITURE.label=Constantly Rearranges Furniture
FURNITURE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} treats every space like a battlefield map. Barracks layout?\
  \ {1} adjusts the bunks for "optimal emergency evacuation routes." DropShip lounge? The chairs\
  \ need to be "fortified positions in case of boarding actions." {5} {8} rolls their eyes when\
  \ they find their lockers moved again - but deep down, they know {2}''s probably not wrong.
FURNITURE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never leaves a room the way {2} found it. {1}''ll shift crates\
  \ in the hangar, move chairs around briefing rooms, and completely rearrange the break area just\
  \ because it didn''t feel right. No one knows why {2} does it, but at this point, the unit just\
  \ waits for The {0} Edition of any given room before getting comfortable.
FURNITURE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} moves furniture not for comfort, but for survival. Every\
  \ table, every chair, every bunk - every piece has to be in the right place. Barricades, fallback\
  \ positions, places to hide. {1} learned the hard way that when an ambush comes, your surroundings\
  \ matter. If {6} {8} thinks {2}''s obsessive, that''s fine - one day, it might save their lives.
FURNITURE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is incapable of leaving a room alone. The storage crates?\
  \ Better flow if they''re stacked this way. The command center? Desks should be closer for\
  \ efficiency. The mess hall? Obviously, tables need to be rotated 45 degrees for maximum comfort.\
  \ The crew walks in every morning never knowing what new layout {0} has cooked up.
FURNITURE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop tweaking the company''s base layout. "This would\
  \ be way more functional if the tool racks were over there." "Why is the coffee machine so far\
  \ from the main entry?" It doesn''t matter if it''s a barracks, a mobile command center, or a\
  \ DropShip cargo hold - {0} will optimize it, even if it means driving everyone insane.
FURNITURE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} moves furniture, gear, everything - not because it matters,\
  \ but because it''s something {2} can change. {1} can''t control which contracts they take, who lives\
  \ or dies, or when the next battle will come. But {2} can control where the damn chairs go. And\
  \ some days, that''s the only thing keeping {4} from losing {6} mind.

GLASSES.label=Constantly Adjusts Glasses
GLASSES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just push up {6} glasses - {2} does it while scanning\
  \ enemy formations, calculating range corrections, or muttering about heat efficiency. {5} {8}\
  \ has learned that when {2} adjusts them twice in a row, {2}''s about to say something really\
  \ important. If {2} takes them off, it''s already too late.
GLASSES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} looks like {2} should be in a research lab, not a battlefield.\
  \ {5} glasses are always slipping down {6} nose, {6} HUD is constantly recalibrating for glare,\
  \ and {2}''s the only one who checks a damage report before checking {6} own injuries. And yet,\
  \ somehow, {2} never misses a shot.
GLASSES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} pushes up {6} glasses like it''ll make the world clearer, like\
  \ it''ll help {4} understand why {2}''s still alive when so many aren''t. {1} sees every mistake,\
  \ every miscalculation, every doomed maneuver before it happens - but no one ever listens in time.\
  \ {1} keeps adjusting {6} glasses, keeps trying to see better - but it doesn''t change a damn thing.
GLASSES.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s glasses are always slipping because {2}''s always\
  \ reading - contract clauses, supply manifests, tech manuals in languages {2} doesn''t actually\
  \ speak. If there''s a scam in a deal, {2}''ll find it. If there''s a loophole in a contract, {2}''ll\
  \ close it. {5} glasses may be old, scratched, and constantly need an adjustment, but they\
  \ never miss a detail.
GLASSES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} adjusts {6} glasses so often that people have started using it\
  \ as a warning sign. If {2}''s doing it absentmindedly while scribbling notes, {2}''s solving a\
  \ problem. If {2} does it sharply while reading, {2}''s just found something terrible. If {2}\
  \ adjusts them three times in a row? Someone messed up big time.
GLASSES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} adjusts {6} glasses as {2} scans death tolls, burned-out\
  \ accounts, the slow collapse of everything. {1} keeps records, because someone has to. {1} keeps\
  \ reading, because ignorance won''t save them. {1} keeps adjusting {6} glasses, because the numbers\
  \ never get any better.

GLOVES.label=Always Wearing Gloves
GLOVES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} insists that good grip is everything. Whether {2}''s scoffing\
  \ down an MRE, cleaning {6} sidearm, or attending a mandatory training meeting, {6} gloves are\
  \ always on. {1} claims they improve performance, reduce wear on {6} hands, and help keep sweat\
  \ from ruining {6} trigger control. {5} {8} thinks {2}''s being excessive - until their own hands\
  \ are blistered and bruised while {6} are perfectly fine.
GLOVES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} is always wearing gloves, no exceptions. No one has ever seen\
  \ {4} take them off - not to eat, not to fix {6} gear, not even to shake hands. Some assume it''s\
  \ habit, others think it''s superstition. The truth? {0} won''t say, and no one has the nerve to\
  \ ask.
GLOVES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s gloves aren''t just habit - they''re armor. Beneath them, {6}\
  \ hands tell stories no one else is allowed to read - burns from an engine explosion, deep scars\
  \ from a knife fight, skin that''s never fully healed from exposure to toxic rain. {1} covers them\
  \ up because if {2} doesn''t, {2}''ll have to explain. And {2} doesn''t want to remember.
GLOVES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} handles supply crates, repair tools, and even paperwork with\
  \ gloved hands. "You do not want to know how dirty these surfaces are," {2} insists while\
  \ disinfecting a shipment manifest. The tech crews roll their eyes, but when they see what\
  \ actually grows inside a poorly maintained coolant line, they start wondering if {2}''s got a\
  \ point.
GLOVES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} cycles through different gloves for different jobs. No matter\
  \ the occasion, {2} always has the right pair ready. At this point, it''s just part of who {2} is.
GLOVES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} wears gloves because {2} remembers. The first time {2} felt warm\
  \ blood seep through {6} fingers, the first time {2} held a dying friend''s hand, the first time {2}\
  \ had to scrub {6} own hands raw to get rid of a stain that never really went away. {1} wears\
  \ gloves now, not to protect {4}self, but to pretend that some things never happened.

HAND_GESTURES.label=Excessive Hand Gestures
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just call out targets - {2} illustrates them with\
  \ wild gestures. {1} points, waves, and practically mimes {6} battle strategies. {5} {8} jokes\
  \ that if {6} radio ever goes down, {2} could probably still direct an entire skirmish just with\
  \ hand signals and exaggerated shrugs.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} can''t give a briefing, tell a story, or even trash-talk\
  \ an enemy without animated, sweeping gestures. {1}''s nearly smacked {6} own teammates more than\
  \ once while explaining a maneuver mid-battle. {1} fights just as expressively - every reload, every\
  \ charge, every headshot somehow feels like it belongs in an action holo.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s hands never stop moving - because if they do, {2} might\
  \ remember. Remember the times {2} couldn''t signal for help, when orders were lost in the chaos,\
  \ when a simple gesture could''ve saved someone but didn''t come in time. {1} talks with {6} hands\
  \ because the alternative is letting them be still - and stillness brings nothing but ghosts.
HAND_GESTURES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just explain supply chain issues - {2} acts them\
  \ out. A shipment delay? {1} throws {6} hands skyward in exasperation. Budget cuts? {1} pantomimes\
  \ a knife slitting a throat. The crew half-listens to {6} actual words, but they always get the\
  \ message thanks to {6} theatrics.
HAND_GESTURES.description.1.SUPPORT="Go left - no, left-left - okay, look, just follow my hand."\
  \ {0}''s gesturing is so wild and exaggerated that sometimes people understand {4} less, not\
  \ more. {5} coworkers have learned to watch the gestures first and listen second.
HAND_GESTURES.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s hands move constantly, tracing out stories, shaping\
  \ invisible diagrams, gesturing through explanations. But there''s something in the way {2}\
  \ hesitates, like {2}''s trying to use them for something else, something other than what they\
  \ were made for - pulling triggers, closing airlocks, writing names on casualty reports. The\
  \ motions keep the past at bay. Barely.

HAND_WRINGER.label=Compulsive Hand-Wringer
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} wrings {6} hands while waiting for battle to start,\
  \ during mission briefings, even mid-firefight. {1} sees every possible way things could go wrong\
  \ and can''t help but fret over them. {5} {8} jokes that if {2} ever stops rubbing {6} hands\
  \ together, that''s when they should start panicking.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} double-checks {6} weapons, reviews the mission plan\
  \ again, and adjusts {6} gear obsessively - but no matter how prepared {2} is, {6} hands keep\
  \ twisting together, like {2}''s waiting for some unseen disaster. The second the bullets start\
  \ flying, though, the hand-wringing stops - because once the battle begins, there''s no time left to\
  \ worry.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} wrings {6} hands because they remember. They remember\
  \ every mission gone wrong, every time {2} hesitated, every comrade {2} couldn''t save. {5} fingers\
  \ trace scars, phantom pains from injuries long healed, from choices that never will. The war\
  \ might not have killed {4} yet, but it''s taken pieces of {4} - one nervous motion at a time.
HAND_WRINGER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just responsible for {6} team - {2}''s responsible for\
  \ people. Every time {2} hands out rations, ammo, or medical kits, {6} hands twist together like\
  \ {2}''s wondering if it''s enough. {1} knows the numbers, but knowing doesn''t make it easier when {2}\
  \ has to tell someone there''s nothing left to give.
HAND_WRINGER.description.1.SUPPORT=It doesn''t matter if it''s a million-C-bill contract or a coffee\
  \ order, {0} agonizes over every decision. {5} hands wring as {2} debates between fuel\
  \ allocations, payment schedules, or whether {2} should requisition one more crate of emergency\
  \ rations. "What if we need it later?" is {6} constant refrain, and no amount of reassurance\
  \ stops the fidgeting.
HAND_WRINGER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} wrings {6} hands not just in nervousness, but in guilt.\
  \ {1}''s the one who signs the orders. The one who makes the calculations - who lives, who fights,\
  \ who doesn''t come back. The numbers say {2}''s making the right calls, but {6} hands still shake\
  \ every time {2} stamps approval on a contract that sends people to their deaths.

HANDSHAKE.label=Overly Enthusiastic Handshake
HANDSHAKE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just shake hands - {2} grips with both hands, shakes\
  \ firmly, and holds on just a little too long. "Good to meet you, friend! We''re going to do great\
  \ things together!" {5} enthusiasm is infectious, but some recruits worry they''ve just signed an\
  \ unspoken blood pact with {4}.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} seals deals, alliances, and battle plans with a handshake\
  \ that could crush a lesser man''s fingers. "Damn good to have you on board!" {2} booms, nearly\
  \ dislocating the arm of a junior officer. It''s less a greeting and more an event, and somehow,\
  \ it actually makes people believe in {4}.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} grips hands like {2}''s afraid to let go, like {2}''s holding\
  \ onto something real in a universe where people vanish in an instant. {5} {8} has seen it\
  \ before - {2} shakes hands like it might be the last time. And too often, it is.
HANDSHAKE.description.0.SUPPORT="Welcome to the chaos!" {0} grins as {2} shakes a MekWarriors''s\
  \ hand so hard their whole torso moves. "Need anything? Ammo, armor, a replacement heat sink? You\
  \ just say the word!" No one can ever claim {0} lacks customer service skills... if they can\
  \ still feel their fingers afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s handshake is a statement, even when it really shouldn''t\
  \ be. Meeting a high-ranking officer? {1} pumps their hand like they''re old drinking buddies.\
  \ Signing a delicate negotiation? {1} shakes so hard it nearly knocks over the paperwork. Everyone\
  \ remembers meeting {0} - if only because their wrist hurts afterward.
HANDSHAKE.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s handshakes are too firm, too eager, too desperate. Like\
  \ {2}''s making sure you know you exist, that you''re real, that you''re still here. Because the\
  \ last time {2} let someone go without a proper handshake, they walked into a battle they didn''t\
  \ walk out of. And {2}''s been making up for it ever since.

HEADPHONES.label=Always Wearing Headphones
HEADPHONES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just go into battle - {2} does it with a playlist.\
  \ Whether it''s heavy metal, modern symphonies, or classical rock, {2} swears the right song\
  \ keeps {4} in the zone. {5} {8} is used to seeing {4} nodding along mid-firefight, completely\
  \ unfazed by the chaos around {4}.
HEADPHONES.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether {2}''s about to drop, in the repair bay, or riding in a\
  \ DropShip, {0} always has {6} headphones on. Always. No one knows what {2}''s listening to, but\
  \ they''re pretty sure {2}''s ignoring everything else - until it''s time to fight. Then, suddenly,\
  \ {2}''s hyper-focused, like the world just synced to {6} personal rhythm.
HEADPHONES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t listen to music because {2} enjoys it. {1} listens\
  \ because if {2} doesn''t, the silence creeps in - the echoes of artillery, the screams over comms,\
  \ the last words of people who didn''t make it. The headphones aren''t just habit. They''re\
  \ survival.
HEADPHONES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} works like {2}''s conducting an orchestra. No one knows\
  \ exactly what {2}''s listening to, but if {6} head starts bobbing, it means things are getting\
  \\ done.
HEADPHONES.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s headphones are a barrier. People argue? {1} doesn''t hear\
  \ it. Commanders complain about budgets? Not {6} problem. Someone waves frantically for {6}\
  \ attention? {1} sighs, reluctantly pulls off one earpiece, and mutters, "This better be\
  \ important."
HEADPHONES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps {6} headphones on because music is the only thing\
  \ that still feels safe. {1}''s seen planets burn, heard the real sounds of war. If {2} keeps the\
  \ music playing, maybe - just maybe - {2} can pretend, for a little while, that the universe isn''t\
  \ completely falling apart.

HEALTHY_SNACKS.label=Frequently Snacking on Healthy Foods
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} treats combat like a sport, and fueling {6} body is part\
  \ of {6} routine. {1}''s always chewing on protein bars, popping dried fruit between drills, and\
  \ downing electrolyte drinks like they''re going out of style. {5} {8} teases {4}, but they\
  \ don''t complain when {2} hands out energy-packed snacks that keep them going during long\
  \ deployments.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} believes in ba{8}. One moment {2}''s unloading an\
  \ autocannon into an enemy vehicle, the next {2}''s peeling an orange and offering vitamin-packed\
  \ snacks to the team. "Hydration''s key to peak combat performance," {2} says, handing a bottle of\
  \ electrolyte water to a comrade who''s still shaking from adrenaline.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t eat healthy because {2}''s a fitness nut - {2} does it\
  \ because {2} knows what it''s like to have nothing. To go days without food, to feel {6} body\
  \ weaken, to fight while running on empty. {1} stocks up, {2} preps, {2} controls {6} intake - because\
  \ the day will come when the food runs out again. And this time, {2}''ll be ready.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} believes a well-fed crew is a functional crew. {1} stocks\
  \ supply depots with the best ration options, pushes fresh produce when {2} can get it, and\
  \ constantly reminds people to eat real meals. If you need a snack, {2}''s already got one on\
  \ hand - just don''t ask for junk food.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} is that guy - the one replacing coffee with herbal tea,\
  \ swapping ration packs for high-protein alternatives, and lecturing the unit about eating real\
  \ food instead of surviving on caffeine and spite. It''s well-meaning... but after the third speech\
  \ about micronutrients, people start hiding their snacks from {4}.
HEALTHY_SNACKS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} stockpiles food, not out of paranoia, but because {2}\
  \ remembers. The hunger, the desperation, the slow, creeping weakness of not having enough. Even\
  \ in times of plenty, {2} stashes protein bars, dried fruit, anything that will last - because {2}\
  \ knows the moment will come when the company is cut off, and when it does, {2} won''t be the one\
  \ caught starving again.

HISTORIAN.label=Passionate about History
HISTORIAN.description.0.COMBATANT=Every skirmish, every engagement, every ambush reminds {4} of a\
  \ past war. "This is just like the Hesperus II siege, different scale, same mistakes," {2}\
  \ mutters, adjusting {6} sights. {5} {8} has learned that whenever {2} starts recounting\
  \ military history mid-firefight, it''s either a sign of {6} confidence - or a really bad omen.
HISTORIAN.description.1.COMBATANT=Tactical formations, famous last stands, the lineage of a\
  \ particular mercenary unit - {2} can recall all of it. One moment {2}''s breaking down the enemy''s\
  \ battle doctrine, the next {2}''s casually mentioning that their insignia has roots in some\
  \ obscure rebellion from 2434. Most of {6} comrades don''t mind - unless they''re trying to focus on\
  \ not dying.
HISTORIAN.description.2.COMBATANT=Wars don''t change, only the names and weapons do. {0} has\
  \ studied enough conflicts to know how units rise and fall, how every so-called unstoppable force\
  \ eventually collapses. {5} knowledge isn''t inspiring - it''s a weight. {1} fights anyway, not\
  \ because {2} thinks this time will be different, but because {2}''s got no other choice.
HISTORIAN.description.0.SUPPORT=A simple request for replacement heat sinks can turn into a\
  \ twenty-minute lesson on old Terran engineering. Reviewing supply routes? Expect a tangent about\
  \ the logistical failures of the Rim War. Most of the company just nods along, secretly hoping\
  \ they''ll retain at least one useful piece of trivia.
HISTORIAN.description.1.SUPPORT=Somewhere in {6} personal storage are old reports, battlefield\
  \ maps, declassified documents, and a collection of holobooks that would make a historian\
  \ jealous. If a mercenary unit ever existed, {2} probably knows about it. If a planet ever hosted\
  \ a battle, {2} has the details. The trick isn''t finding information - it''s escaping before {2} tells\
  \ the entire backstory.
HISTORIAN.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just study the famous battles - {2} memorizes the\
  \ names of those no one remembers. The soldiers whose units were wiped out, the mercenary\
  \ companies that vanished, the colonies erased by war and never rebuilt. {1} collects their\
  \ stories because no one else will. Because one day, someone will have to do the same for {4}.

HUMMER.label=Habitual Hummer
HUMMER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is always humming - sometimes a marching cadence, sometimes\
  \ an old bar song, sometimes a melody no one else recognizes. It''s not loud, just a quiet hum\
  \ over comms while {2} lines up a shot or waits for the next engagement. {5} {8} jokes that if\
  \ {2} ever stops humming, that''s when things have really gone bad.
HUMMER.description.1.COMBATANT=In the middle of a firefight, with missiles flying and alarms\
  \ blaring, {0} is still humming. {1} does it when charging, when bracing for impact, even while\
  \ dodging incoming fire. Some say it helps {4} focus. Others think {2}''s just a little too\
  \ comfortable in the chaos. Either way, the tune never stops - until the shooting does.
HUMMER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} hums to fill the silence where voices used to be. The\
  \ comrades who didn''t make it back, the allies lost on distant battlefields, the old commanders\
  \ who once barked orders over the radio. If {2} hums loud enough, maybe {2} won''t have to hear\
  \ their ghosts whispering back.
HUMMER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} hums as {2} takes inventory, hums while filling out\
  \ manifests, hums while rerouting cargo through bureaucratic nightmares. The tech crew has long\
  \ since accepted that the low hum of an old war tune or a jaunty little ditty means {0} is\
  \ nearby - usually with a clipboard and a sarcastic comment.
HUMMER.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter where {2} is, {0} is always humming something. It''s\
  \ never the same tune twice, and it''s always just loud enough to be noticed. Whether {2}''s\
  \ reviewing documents or walking through the barracks, {6} ever-present melody has become as much\
  \ a part of the company as the sound of ''Mek repairs in the hangar.
HUMMER.description.2.SUPPORT=The company has lost a lot - good pilots, steady contracts, entire\
  \ DropShips full of people who never made it back. {0} hums because silence is worse. Silence\
  \ means another mission failure. Silence means another name wiped off the roster. Silence means\
  \ they''re next. If {2} keeps humming, keeps making some kind of noise, maybe they''re not done yet.

HYGIENIC.label=Obsessed with Hygiene
HYGIENIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} gear spotless, {6} weapons polished, and {6}\
  \ bunk smelling shockingly fresh. No matter how bad the battlefield gets, {2} finds time to wipe\
  \ down {6} visor and disinfect {6} gloves. {5} {8} laughs, but when their weapons jam from dust\
  \ buildup and {6} fires clean, they start to reconsider.
HYGIENIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} refuses to drink from shared canteens, avoids touching\
  \ anything that hasn''t been sanitized, and definitely has a stash of antiseptic wipes in every\
  \ pocket. "You think the enemy is the real threat?" {2} scoffs. "Try an untreated infection in the\
  \ middle of a contract." They joke that {2}''s over the top - until half the {8} goes down with\
  \ trench fever, and {0}''s the only one still standing.
HYGIENIC.description.2.COMBATANT=No amount of scrubbing can wash the blood from {6} hands. {0}\
  \ showers until {6} skin is raw, sterilizes {6} gear twice before every battle, and wipes down\
  \ every surface {2} touches. {1} tells {4}self it''s just habit, but deep down, {2} knows - no matter\
  \ how hard {2} tries, some stains never come out.
HYGIENIC.description.0.SUPPORT={0} keeps {6} workspace pristine. Every surface is dusted,\
  \ every tool is disinfected, and no one touches the inventory without wearing gloves. "Clean\
  \ workspace, clean workflow," {2} mutters, wiping down a perfectly spotless terminal. The techs\
  \ roll their eyes, but deep down, they appreciate not having to work in filth.
HYGIENIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a very firm stance on personal cleanliness. Boots off\
  \ before entering the barracks, no eating near the control consoles, and absolutely no sneezing\
  \ without covering your mouth. If {2} had it {6} way, every MekWarrior would get decontaminated\
  \ before stepping into a cockpit. The commander refuses to humor {4} - but {0} still sprays down\
  \ every chair with disinfectant when no one''s looking.
HYGIENIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop the war. {1} can''t stop the deaths, the\
  \ betrayals, the slow rot of another unit heading toward ruin. But {2} can keep {6} workspace\
  \ clean. {1} can scrub the blood from the floors. {1} can make sure that, if nothing else, {6}\
  \ hands don''t feel dirty - even when the rest of {4} does.

IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.label=Unusual Sleep Patterns
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t follow a normal sleep cycle - {2} sleeps when the\
  \ war lets {4}. A 15-minute nap in a cockpit? Good enough. Two hours slumped against a crate\
  \ between missions? That''ll do. {5} {8} wonders how {2} functions, but when the fighting starts,\
  \ {2}''s always ready, no matter when {2} last closed {6} eyes.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust sleep, not completely. {1}''s the one pacing\
  \ the perimeter at odd hours, tinkering with {6} gear at 0300, sipping coffee while watching the\
  \ horizon. "Somebody''s gotta keep an eye on things," {2} says, adjusting {6} harness. The truth?\
  \ {1} sleeps best when {2} knows someone else is standing watch - but {2} never quite trusts anyone\
  \ enough to let {4}self drift off.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t sleep like normal people because {6} body\
  \ remembers too much. Every time {2} closes {6} eyes, {6} mind replays firefights {2} barely\
  \ survived, comrades {2} couldn''t save, the slow-motion collapse of a battle gone wrong. {1} stays\
  \ awake as long as possible, dreading the moment exhaustion forces {4} to relive it all.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} sleeps in shifts that make no sense to anyone else - two\
  \ hours here, a nap there, then somehow a full eight hours in the middle of a work cycle. No one\
  \ knows how {2} keeps things running on such an erratic schedule, but somehow, the work is still\
  \ finished on time.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats sleep like an inconvenience. There''s always another\
  \ report to file, another order to review, another detail to double-check. "I''ll sleep when\
  \ things slow down," {2} says - but things never slow down. {5} coworkers have started making bets\
  \ on when {2}''ll finally pass out at {6} desk.
IRREGULAR_SLEEPER.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep isn''t rest - it''s vulnerability. It''s time lost, moments {2}\
  \ can''t control, a gap in awareness where something can go wrong. {0} puts it off, fights it,\
  \ drinks stimulant-laced tea just to keep going a little longer. {1} tells {4}self it''s about\
  \ efficiency, but deep down, {2} knows - when {2} finally crashes, {2} might not want to wake up\
  \ again.

JOKER.label=Fond of Puns
JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} cracks puns even in the heat of battle. "Looks like that\
  \ guy''s having a meltdown," {2} quips after overheating an enemy ''Mek. {5} {8} groans at {6}\
  \ constant wordplay, but they can''t deny it lightens the tension - just enough to keep them steady\
  \ when the situation turns grim.
JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Whether it''s a firefight, a stealth op, or a tense briefing,\
  \ {0} finds time for a pun. "Guess you could say we really blasted through that ambush," {2}\
  \ says with a grin, wiping soot off {6} armor. {5} {8} has stopped trying to stop {4} - it''s\
  \ better to let {4} get it out of {6} system and keep moving.
JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s puns aren''t just for fun - they''re armor. Every terrible\
  \ joke, every groan-worthy pun is a way to push back against the constant dread of war. "We may\
  \ be fighting uphill, but at least we''ve got a peak advantage," {2} says with a wink. But behind\
  \ the grin, there''s a weariness {2}''ll never put into words.
JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Whatever {0} is doing, there''s always a pun involved. {5}\
  \ colleagues roll their eyes, but even the most jaded warrior cracks a smile now and then.
JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT=The war never stops, the work never ends, but {0} finds a way\
  \ to make it just a little less awful. {1} sticks pun-laden sticky notes on schedules, makes\
  \ groan-worthy jokes during routine maintenance, and ensures no report leaves {6} desk without at\
  \ least one bad pun. No one likes it - but no one really wants {4} to stop, either.
JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=Every pun is forced, every joke just a little too loud. {0}\
  \ keeps the wordplay coming because if {2} stops, {2}''ll have to face the reality of what {2}''s\
  \ dealing with - the broken machines, the wounded soldiers, the paperwork documenting another\
  \ casualty instead of another paycheck. "Looks like someone''s having a rough day," {2} says,\
  \ filling out another death report. The laugh that follows is just a little too hollow.

LISTS.label=Compulsive List Maker
LISTS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, {0} has a list - objectives, fallback\
  \ positions, enemy strengths, even a checklist of which comrades owe {4} money from last week''s\
  \ poker game. {1} swears by {6} method, and given how rarely {2}''s caught off guard, {6} team is\
  \ starting to believe {2}''s onto something.
LISTS.description.1.COMBATANT=Every battle, every skirmish, every firefight has a plan. {0}\
  \ keeps a running list in {6} HUD - priority targets, terrain advantages, escape routes. "War is\
  \ just a series of problems to solve," {2} says, adding a mental checkmark as {2} takes down\
  \ another enemy.
LISTS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows war is a mess - {2}''s seen friends die, missions\
  \ collapse, and too many unpredictable variables. So {2} makes lists. Lists of enemies confirmed\
  \ dead. Lists of the wounded. Lists of names {2} never wants to forget. It doesn''t stop the chaos,\
  \ but at least on paper, it looks like something is under control.
LISTS.description.0.SUPPORT=It doesn''t matter what {2}''s doing - {0} has a list for it. Daily\
  \ tasks? Listed. Emergency protocols? Color-coded and categorized. Someone asks {4} about\
  \ inventory? {1} flips through {6} secondary list to cross-reference the real list. No one knows\
  \ how {2} keeps track of so much, but without {4}, the whole operation would grind to a halt.
LISTS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust memory - {2} trusts lists. Schedules, ration\
  \ allocations, critical injuries - if it matters, it''s on a datapad or scribbled onto a notepad {2}\
  \ refuses to lose. "If it''s not written down, it didn''t happen," {2} says, making another\
  \ annotation that absolutely didn''t need to be recorded but will come in handy later.
LISTS.description.2.SUPPORT=The lists are getting longer. More damaged equipment, more\
  \ unpaid wages, more missing personnel. {0} doesn''t just track resources - {2} tracks the decline.\
  \ Every name marked "deceased," every supply line lost, every payment delayed. {1} doesn''t talk\
  \ about it, but in the quiet hours, {2} flips through {6} notes, wondering when {2}''ll have to add\
  \ {4}self to the final list.

LITERAL.label=Overly Literal
LITERAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Cover me!" {0}''s {8} shouts, diving for cover. {0},\
  \ standing still, replies, "Cover you with what? Suppressive fire? Smoke? A tarp?" While {6} unit\
  \ groans, {2}''s already assessing precisely what they need - because in battle, clarity matters.
LITERAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Take out that tank!" {0} pauses. "Do you mean destroy the\
  \ tank, or just disable it? Are we capturing it? Are we worried about collateral damage?" By the\
  \ time {2} gets {6} answers, the {8} has already moved - but at least {2} never misinterprets a\
  \ command.
LITERAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t use euphemisms. {1} doesn''t talk about\
  \ "eliminating hostiles" or "neutralizing threats." {1} calls it what it is - killing. {1}''s seen too\
  \ many people hide behind vague language, pretending it makes war cleaner. {1} refuses. War isn''t\
  \ clean. And {2} won''t pretend otherwise
LITERAL.description.0.SUPPORT="{0}, patch up that report." {1} grabs a literal patch kit.\
  \ "{0}, hand me that tool." {1} places it directly in someone''s palm. "{0}, fix this system\
  \ real quick." "Define quick," {2} responds, already pulling out a diagnostic report. {1}''s not\
  \ trying to be difficult - {2} just needs precision.
LITERAL.description.1.SUPPORT=If a contract says "supplies will be provided as available,"\
  \ {0} will absolutely demand clarification on what "available" means. If a report says\
  \ someone was "lost in action," {2} will not accept it unless {2} gets clear details. It makes\
  \ negotiations painful - but it also prevents a lot of costly mistakes.
LITERAL.description.2.SUPPORT="How''s the company holding up, {0}?" someone asks. {1} doesn''t\
  \ sugarcoat it. "We''ve lost 32% of our working Mek, supply reserves are critical, and we''re\
  \ two payroll cycles from insolvency." No one ever wants to hear {6} reports, but {0} won''t\
  \ lie, won''t soften the truth. Because in a world where everyone tries to mask the inevitable,\
  \ someone has to face it head-on.

LOCKS.label=Checks Locks Repeatedly
LOCKS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} double-checks every hatch, seal, and weapons locker\
  \ before and after deployment. "If you assume something''s secure, that''s when it isn''t," {2}\
  \ mutters, tugging at a latch one more time. {5} {8} jokes that {2}''d probably check the\
  \ airlock itself if they let {4} - but no one complains when {6} obsessive habits keep them alive.
LOCKS.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn''t matter if they''re bunked down in a secure zone or\
  \ camping in enemy territory - {0} will always check every entrance, every lock, every secured\
  \ weapon. "You laugh now," {2} says, rattling the latch again, "but the one time I don''t do this,\
  \ we''ll get jumped in our sleep."
LOCKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to trust that locked doors stayed locked. {1} doesn''t\
  \ anymore. {1} remembers the time a door didn''t seal, the time an enemy slipped through unsecured\
  \ defenses, the time someone {2} was supposed to protect didn''t make it. Now, {2} checks every\
  \ lock, every latch, every seal - because if something does go wrong, at least {2}''ll know it wasn''t\
  \ {6} fault this time.
LOCKS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} runs things like a fortress. If a locker is supposed to be\
  \ locked, {2}''ll verify it three times. If a storage bay has security codes, {2} personally resets\
  \ them. No one gets unauthorized access on {6} watch - partially because {2}''s paranoid, and\
  \ partially because {2} really enjoys telling people no.
LOCKS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} always double-checks the locks. If someone says a door is\
  \ sealed, {2}''ll check anyway. If someone insists an override is definitely disabled, {2}''ll still\
  \ run {6} test. It''s not personal - {2} just knows better than to trust assumptions.
LOCKS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} locks things because {2} knows what happens when you don''t.\
  \ {1}''s seen desperate refugees raid supply caches, saboteurs slip into barracks, doors that\
  \ should have held shattered when it mattered most. {1} can''t control the war, the contracts, the\
  \ inevitable losses - but {2} can make sure that, for now, the doors stay locked.

MEASURED_TALKER.label=Tends to Speak in a Measured Pace
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT=No matter how intense the battle gets, {0}''s voice never\
  \ wavers. {1} delivers orders with the slow, deliberate cadence of someone who refuses to be\
  \ rushed. "Adjust... thirty meters left... fire." {5} {8} swears that hearing {4} on comms is\
  \ almost calming - until they realize that if {0}''s still speaking that way, things must be even\
  \ worse than they thought.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT=While others shout over each other, {0} waits. {1} listens,\
  \ thinks, then speaks carefully. "We engage now, we overextend. We wait ten seconds, we flank."\
  \ {1} refuses to let adrenaline dictate {6} decisions, and while it frustrates more aggressive\
  \ warriors, {6} {8} has learned to trust {4}.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to talk faster, used to joke, used to care more.\
  \ Now, every word is deliberate, like {2}''s trying not to waste them. {1}''s seen too many people\
  \ speak their last words before they even knew they''d die. So now, {2} speaks like {2}''s making\
  \ sure every sentence matters. Because someday, {2} won''t get another one.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} talks like {2}''s drafting a contract in real time. Whether\
  \ it''s discussing orders, timelines, or options, every word is deliberate, precise. No one ever\
  \ walks away confused - but they do sometimes walk away wondering if they just got outmaneuvered in\
  \ a simple conversation.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT=When {0} explains a process, {2} does it slowly, clearly, and\
  \ with no room for misunderstanding. "You will disconnect the relay. You will not touch the\
  \ exposed wiring. If you do, you will absolutely die." Whether {2}''s training rookies or giving\
  \ mission updates, {6} methodical speech ensures that no one can claim they didn''t hear {4}.
MEASURED_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t raise {6} voice, doesn''t rush {6} words, doesn''t\
  \ waste breath. {1} speaks with the weight of someone who has already delivered bad news too many\
  \ times. When {2} tells a soldier, "You''ll be fine," they believe {4}. When {2} says, "There''s\
  \ nothing more I can do," they know {2}''s already tried everything.

MINIMALIST.label=Extreme Minimalism
MINIMALIST.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s kit is stripped down to the absolute essentials - no\
  \ extra ammo, no backup gear, no sentimental keepsakes. "More weight slows you down," {2} says,\
  \ tightening the one pouch {2} allows {4}self. {5} {8} teases {4} for it, but when they''re\
  \ struggling under overstuffed packs and {2}''s still moving, they start to reconsider.
MINIMALIST.description.1.COMBATANT=No unnecessary attachments, no redundant weapons, no fancy\
  \ tech. {0} keeps {6} loadout simple - because simple works. "You don''t need a dozen backup\
  \ plans," {2} says, securing {6} sidearm. "You need one that won''t fail." It''s an efficient\
  \ mindset, but some worry it''s less about discipline and more about not wanting to get attached\
  \ to anything.
MINIMALIST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} owns nothing {2} wouldn''t be willing to leave behind. No\
  \ personal items, no extra gear, no home to return to. {1} fights with what {2} carries, and if {2}\
  \ has to abandon it tomorrow, {2} will. Because war takes everything eventually - better to live\
  \ like you''ve already lost it all.
MINIMALIST.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in excess. Everything in {6} workspace is\
  \ accounted for and necessary. If it''s not useful, it''s gone. "Extra gear is just dead weight,"\
  \ {2} mutters, denying yet another request for nonessential items. Efficiency isn''t just a\
  \ goal - it''s the rule.
MINIMALIST.description.1.SUPPORT=No unnecessary tasks, no excessive reports, no overcomplicated\
  \ solutions. {0} patches what needs patching, nothing extra. "Good enough is good enough," {2}\
  \ says, stepping back from another just-functional-enough fix. It keeps things running - but some\
  \ worry that one day, {6} definition of ''good enough'' won''t be enough.
MINIMALIST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just live simply - {2} removes everything that\
  \ doesn''t serve a purpose. Personal items? A distraction. Extra gear? Just something to lose.\
  \ Relationships? Harder to let go of than supplies, but just as fleeting. If {2} only keeps what''s\
  \ necessary, maybe it won''t hurt so much when it all falls apart.

MUG.label=Prefers Using a Specific Mug
MUG.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, {0} drinks from {6} mug. Doesn''t matter\
  \ if it''s coffee, tea, or a protein shake - it only counts if it''s in the same battered, slightly\
  \ dented, and thoroughly stained cup. {5} {8} doesn''t question it. Given how many battles {2}''s\
  \ survived, they figure it might actually be lucky.
MUG.description.1.COMBATANT="The shape keeps the liquid at the optimal temperature," {0}\
  \ insists, sipping from {6} one and only mug. "The handle has perfect weight distribution." {1}\
  \ refuses to use any other cup, even if it means rinsing it out in battlefield runoff before\
  \ pouring another drink. {5} {8} has long since accepted that the mug goes where {2} goes.
MUG.description.2.COMBATANT=The mug has been with {4} longer than most of {6} comrades.\
  \ {1}''s left planets behind, lost equipment, abandoned people - but this remains. {0} doesn''t\
  \ talk about where {2} got it or why {2} won''t replace it. {1} just holds it a little tighter on the\
  \ nights when the war feels particularly close.
MUG.description.0.SUPPORT={0} keeps things running like clockwork, but if anyone so much\
  \ as touches {6} mug, they''re in for a lecture. "You want coffee? Fine. You don''t use this mug."\
  \ {1}''s signed off on impossible job lists without blinking, but the day someone borrowed {6} mug?\
  \ That was a crisis.
MUG.description.1.SUPPORT=There could be an emergency, a full company deployment, a\
  \ reactor on fire - but {0} will not start work without drinking from {6} one mug. "Things\
  \ function better with consistency," {2} says, taking another sip. The fact that {2} talks about\
  \ {6} mug the same way {2} talks about people is concerning.
MUG.description.2.SUPPORT=The bunk, the uniform, the gear - it all belongs to the company.\
  \ It all changes with every contract, every deployment. But the mug? The mug is {6}. The one\
  \ thing that hasn''t been replaced, reassigned, or lost to war. If {2} ever loses it, {2}''s not sure\
  \ what will be left of {4}.

NAIL_BITER.label=Constant Nail Biter
NAIL_BITER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t flinch under fire, doesn''t panic when missiles\
  \ rain down - but {6} fingers tell a different story. {5} nails are jagged, bitten down to near\
  \ nothing, the casualty of endless waiting, briefing delays, and long hours in the scrum. It''s\
  \ not fear, {2} insists. Just something to do while the next battle looms.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-firefight, mid-strategy meeting, mid-conversation - {0}''s\
  \ fingers are always near {6} mouth, absentmindedly gnawed as {2} thinks. "{0}, stop biting your\
  \ damn nails," someone mutters over comms. A second of silence, then: "Huh? Oh. Right." It lasts\
  \ maybe five minutes before {2} starts again.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.COMBATANT={5} hands shake after missions, so {2} bites {6} nails. It gives\
  \ {4} something to focus on, something small to control when everything else spirals beyond {6}\
  \ grasp. If {6} fingers are raw, if {6} nails are ruined - well, at least it''s proof {2}''s still\
  \ here. At least it''s {6} own damage, not someone else''s.
NAIL_BITER.description.0.SUPPORT={5} job is a battlefield of its own, and {0} feels every\
  \ engagement. Inventory shortages, delayed shipments, missing tools - each issue gets a little more\
  \ nail chewed away. "We''re short on fusion coolant again?" {2} mutters, biting the edge of {6}\
  \ thumbnail. If {2} had an intact fingernail left, it would be a miracle.
NAIL_BITER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} works fast, {6} brain running just ahead of {6} hands, {6}\
  \ teeth worrying at {6} nails between quick repairs. "Hold still, almost done - just let me - "\
  \ crunch. The nervous habit doesn''t slow {4} down, but {6} tools are often slick with antiseptic\
  \ from another self-inflicted cut.
NAIL_BITER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t talk about {6} stress. {1} doesn''t lash out,\
  \ doesn''t break things, doesn''t complain. Instead, {6} nails are bitten down to raw, torn messes,\
  \ silent proof of the pressure grinding {4} down. It''s the only thing {2} allows {4}self - the only\
  \ wound {2}''s willing to show.

NICKNAMING.label=Frequent Nicknaming
NICKNAMING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} almost never calls {6} teammates by their actual names.\
  \ The rookie pilot? ''Hotshot.'' The team''s allocated tech? ''Sparky.'' The commander? ''Big Boss.''\
  \ Half the unit has stopped correcting {4}, because by the time they do, {2}''s already come up\
  \ with another one.
NICKNAMING.description.1.COMBATANT="Alright, Thunderfist, you take point. Stickbug, you cover the\
  \ left flank. Princess, you - " "{0}, I swear to god, stop calling me that." But {0} doesn''t\
  \ stop. Ever. Once {2}''s assigned a nickname, it sticks. If you don''t like it? Too bad. That just\
  \ makes {4} say it more.
NICKNAMING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} hands out nicknames like candy. It''s easier than\
  \ remembering real names - because real names come with memories. With losses. With faces {2}''d\
  \ rather not picture when {2} tries to sleep. As long as they''re ''Razor'' or ''Gunsmoke'' or\
  \ ''Scrappy'', {2} doesn''t have to think about how many real names {2}''s already had to cross out.
NICKNAMING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in titles. The lead mechanic is ''Grease,''\
  \ the MedTech is ''Patches,'' and the newest recruit is ''Fresh Meat'' until they earn something\
  \ better. It''s all part of the company''s culture now - at this point, even {2} probably doesn''t\
  \ remember their real names.
NICKNAMING.description.1.SUPPORT=Everyone who works with {0} gets a nickname, and once {2}\
  \ assigns one, it''s yours for life. The problem? They don''t always make sense. "Hey, ''Wires,''\
  \ pass me that wrench." "{0}, I''m not an electrician." "Don''t argue with me, Wires." The\
  \ name sticks. It always sticks.
NICKNAMING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} gives out names because it means someone sees you.\
  \ Military units burn through people fast - soldiers, techs, medics, clerks. Most of them get a\
  \ number on a payroll log and little else. But if {0} calls you ''Chief'' or ''Rookie'' or\
  \ ''Grimlock,'' it means you existed. Even if only for a little while.

NIGHT_OWL.label=Night Owl
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is at {6} best when the sun''s down. While the rest of the\
  \ {8} struggles through late-night operations, {2}''s fully alert, reacting faster, making\
  \ sharper calls. "Midnight raids, night drops, stealth ops? That''s my time to shine," {2} says,\
  \ adjusting {6} visor. Some wonder if {2} even sleeps - or if {2} just waits for daylight to pass.
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.COMBATANT=While the {8} sleeps, {0} patrols, cleans {6} gear, and\
  \ tunes {6} HUD. "Somebody''s gotta be awake," {2} says, sipping yet another cup of bitter coffee.\
  \ {1} insists it''s not paranoia - {2} just prefers the quiet, the way the battlefield feels different\
  \ under starlight.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} stays up not because {2} wants to, but because sleep\
  \ brings things {2} doesn''t want to see. Memories of burning cities, last words over broken comms,\
  \ the slow count of names {2}''s lost. The night is quiet. And if {2} keeps {6} eyes open long\
  \ enough, maybe {2} won''t have to dream at all.
NIGHT_OWL.description.0.SUPPORT=If you need something from {0}, better check after\
  \ midnight - because that''s when {2}''s actually working. Inventory manifests? Updated at 3 AM.\
  \ Reports? Submitted right before dawn. The company has learned to just roll with it. "You can do\
  \ this at a normal time, you know." "Yeah, but I won''t."
NIGHT_OWL.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s tools are always in motion long after everyone else has\
  \ passed out. Diagnostics, late-night assignment overhauls, last-minute job lists? That''s when {2}\
  \ gets {6} best work done. "No distractions, no idiots asking questions - just me and the\
  \ machines," {2} says, taking a sip of something that definitely isn''t just coffee.
NIGHT_OWL.description.2.SUPPORT=The company''s debts. The worn-out equipment. The empty beds of\
  \ warriors who aren''t coming back. {0} stays awake long after the others sleep, because someone\
  \ has to see it, to witness the slow collapse. {1} won''t talk about it, won''t wake anyone up - but\
  \ every night, {2}''s there, staring at the ceiling, wondering how much longer it''ll all last.

NOTE_TAKER.label=Compulsive Note-Taking
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} keeps a small, weathered notebook strapped to {6} gear.\
  \ Enemy movements, ammo counts, battle formations - if it happens, {2} writes it down. Some joke\
  \ that {2}''s trying to become a war historian, but when {6} notes reveal enemy patterns before\
  \ command does, no one''s laughing.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT=Every briefing, every engagement, every conversation - {0} is\
  \ writing. Notes in a datapad, shorthand scribbled on the back of {6} glove, coordinates\
  \ scratched into the inside of {6} cockpit. "Memory''s unreliable," {2} says, flipping through\
  \ pages of previous battles. "Records last."
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} writes names. {1} writes dates. {1} writes everything\
  \ because {2}''s seen too many people vanish without a trace. No records. No burial. Just gone. So\
  \ {2} records them, their stories, their moments - because in a war where people disappear\
  \ overnight, maybe this way, they''ll still exist.
NOTE_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s logs are legendary. Every job, every tool, every\
  \ assignment is recorded somewhere. "Paper trails save lives," {2} mutters, flipping through {6}\
  \ notes to prove - again - that the last batch of supplies was signed out three days ago. No one ever\
  \ wins arguments with {0}.
NOTE_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every report, every single action {0} takes gets\
  \ documented and {6} notes are meticulous. If someone asks for a status update, {2} doesn''t\
  \ speak - {2} hands them a log entry with timestamps, materials used, and a breakdown of everything\
  \ that happened.
NOTE_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps too many notes. Not just equipment statuses and\
  \ mission briefings, but the slow decay of everything around {4}. Fuel shortages. Unpaid wages.\
  \ The steady reduction of names in the payroll log. One day, someone will look back at {6}\
  \ records and see exactly when the company started dying. But for now, only {2}''s paying\
  \ attention.

NOTEBOOK.label=Always Carrying a Notebook
NOTEBOOK.description.0.COMBATANT=Enemy formations, heat sink efficiency, which teammate still\
  \ owes {4} money - {0} documents it all. {5} notebook is crammed with mission notes, tactical\
  \ sketches, and half-finished thoughts written in hurried shorthand. "If I forget, it''s my fault.\
  \ If I write it down, it''s fact."
NOTEBOOK.description.1.COMBATANT=While others rely on intuition, {0} checks {6} notes. "Last\
  \ time we fought a {8} like this, they favored a pincer maneuver," {2} mutters, flipping back\
  \ through pages. Some scoff at {6} reliance on old scribbles - until they realize {6} predictions\
  \ are almost always right.
NOTEBOOK.description.2.COMBATANT=Names of fallen comrades. Coordinates of battles no one\
  \ remembers. A tally of shots fired, Mek destroyed, debts unpaid. {0} writes it all down\
  \ because if {2} doesn''t, it''ll be like it never happened. {1} doesn''t trust history to remember\
  \ the truth. That''s {6} job.
NOTEBOOK.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what someone needs {0} has it written down. "I\
  \ logged that two weeks ago," {2} says, flipping through pages, already finding the answer before\
  \ anyone else even thinks to check a terminal. {5} system isn''t digital, but it never fails.
NOTEBOOK.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t rely on memory. Every job requested, every\
  \ procedure performed, every minor incident - all of it goes in the notebook. {1} doesn''t always\
  \ explain why {2} records so much, but if someone asks, {2} simply says, "Because someone has to."
NOTEBOOK.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s notebook isn''t just logs - it''s a record of decline.\
  \ Ration cuts, missing payments, the names of warriors who never came back. {1} writes it all\
  \ because no one else does. Because someday, the company will fall apart completely. And someone\
  \ should at least remember how it happened.

OBJECT.label=Carries a Personal Object
OBJECT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never enters battle without {6} one personal item - a lucky\
  \ coin, a worn-out playing card, a patch from an old uniform. "You don''t mess with luck," {2}\
  \ says, tucking it into {6} pocket before every mission. Whether it actually helps or not, {6}\
  \ {8} knows better than to question it.
OBJECT.description.1.COMBATANT=In the chaos of war, {0} keeps one thing constant. Maybe it''s\
  \ a trinket from home, maybe it''s something given to {4} by someone long gone. It doesn''t matter\
  \ what it is - what matters is that it''s {6}. When the battle''s over and the adrenaline fades, {2}\
  \ grips it tight, reminding {4}self that {2}''s still here.
OBJECT.description.2.COMBATANT=The object in {0}''s possession isn''t sentimental - it''s\
  \ survival. A reminder of who {2} used to be, of a promise {2} couldn''t keep, of a person {2} once\
  \ knew. {1} doesn''t talk about it, doesn''t let anyone touch it, doesn''t explain why {2} refuses to\
  \ part with it. Some wounds don''t bleed, but they never heal either.
OBJECT.description.0.SUPPORT=Whether it''s a well-worn multitool, an old pocket watch, or a\
  \ scrap of a long faded photo, {0}''s always carrying something familiar. "You gotta have\
  \ something of your own in a job like this," {2} says. No one knows where {2} got it, but they know\
  \ {2}''d notice immediately if it ever went missing.
OBJECT.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s job changes, {6} location changes, the people around {4}\
  \ change - but one thing never does. That personal item, the thing always tucked into a pocket,\
  \ clipped to {6} belt, or hidden inside {6} jacket. It''s not about sentimentality. It''s about\
  \ having something that stays the same.
OBJECT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t keep {6} special object because it makes {4}\
  \ happy. {1} keeps it because it reminds {4} of what''s been lost. A tag from a dead comrade, a\
  \ ring from a life left behind, a torn page from a book {2} never got to finish. {1} doesn''t talk\
  \ about it. {1} doesn''t need to. Anyone who looks into {6} eyes when {2} holds it already\
  \ understands.

ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.label=Obsessive Tendencies
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just follow orders - {2} perfects them. Whether it''s\
  \ drilling a maneuver until it''s second nature or recalibrating {6} weapon for the third time in\
  \ an hour, {2} won''t stop until every variable is accounted for. {5} {8} teases {4} for being\
  \ too precise - until they see {4} land a shot no one else could make.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.COMBATANT=If an enemy gets away, {0} remembers. If a battle doesn''t go\
  \ exactly as planned, {2} analyzes it endlessly. {5} obsession with what should have happened\
  \ keeps {4} awake at night, scribbling notes and running scenarios. The {8} tells {4} to let it\
  \ go, but deep down, they know - {6} fixation makes {4} dangerous.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s obsessiveness isn''t just habit - it''s desperation. {1}\
  \ can''t stop tweaking {6} loadout, refining battle plans, checking {6} gear again and\
  \ again - because the moment {2} stops? The moment {2} trusts things to go as expected? That''s when\
  \ people die. And {2}''s already lost too many.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just do {6} job - {2} masters it and triple-checks\
  \ everything. "There is no such thing as an acceptable margin of error," {2} mutters while going\
  \ over numbers again. Others may get frustrated with {6} constant rechecking, but they also\
  \ know - if {0} says it''s right, it''s right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter the task {0} refuses to call something finished\
  \ until it meets {6} impossibly high standards. "It''s fine," someone tells {4}. "No," {2} replies,\
  \ making one last adjustment. "It''s correct." The rest of the team has learned to let {4}\
  \ work - because once {2}''s satisfied, the job is done right.
ORGANIZATIONAL_TENDENCIES.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s attention to detail isn''t about perfection - it''s about\
  \ control. {1} can''t stop the war. {1} can''t stop people from dying. But {2} can make sure that this\
  \ form is filed correctly. Because if {2} ever lets {6} mind wander to the things {2} can''t fix,\
  \ {2}''s not sure {2}''ll come back from it.

ORGANIZER.label=Always Organizing
ORGANIZER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s gear is always perfectly arranged - pants folded, boots\
  \ cleaned and stored in exact order, emergency rations packed in a precise grid. {5} {8} teases\
  \ {4} about it, but when they need something fast in the middle of a fight, {2}''s the one who\
  \ always knows where to find it.
ORGANIZER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before every battle, {0} insists on running a final check.\
  \ Formation assignments? Confirmed. Backup comms? Verified. Extraction routes? Plotted and\
  \ re-plotted. "The battlefield is messy enough," {2} mutters. "No reason we have to be." The\
  \ others may roll their eyes, but when things go wrong, {6} plans are why they make it out alive.
ORGANIZER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is disorder, destruction, entropy. {0} fights back the\
  \ only way {2} can - by making sure {6} world stays structured. {5} clothes are perfectly aligned in\
  \ {6} locker. {5} boots are arranged at precise angles. {5} gear is exactly where it needs to be.\
  \ Because if {2} ever lets the chaos creep in, {2} knows it''ll take more than just {6}\
  \ equipment - it''ll take {4}, too.
ORGANIZER.description.0.SUPPORT=It doesn''t matter if {2}''s relaxing, performing {6} duties, or\
  \ handling reports - {0} makes sure everything is where it''s supposed to be. Files? Sorted.\
  \ Tools? Arranged by frequency of use. Supplies? Restocked and labeled. No one questions {6}\
  \ methods anymore - because when they need something fast, {0} already has it ready.
ORGANIZER.description.1.SUPPORT=A cluttered workspace? Unacceptable. A jumbled manifest?\
  \ Unthinkable. If {0} walks into a messy storage room, {2} will reorganize it. "I don''t care if\
  \ you know where everything is," {2} mutters, shifting crates into a more logical layout. "You''ll\
  \ know where it is, and it''ll make sense." The others sigh, but they also know - {6} system works.
ORGANIZER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop the war. {1} can''t save everyone. But {2} can\
  \ make sure the medical kits are stocked, the equipment is sorted, the files are in perfect\
  \ order. If {2} controls the little things, maybe - just maybe - it''ll feel like {2} has control over\
  \ something. Because deep down, {2} knows: no amount of organization can stop the unit from\
  \ falling apart.

ORIGAMI.label=Fond of Origami
ORIGAMI.description.0.COMBATANT={0} spends downtime folding scraps of paper into precise,\
  \ intricate shapes. Battle maps, ration packaging, even old mission reports - nothing is safe from\
  \ {6} hands. {5} {8} laughs, but there''s something unnervingly methodical about the way {2}\
  \ creases each fold, like {2}''s applying the same focus {2} does to planning a battle.
ORIGAMI.description.1.COMBATANT=No one knows when {0} does it, but somehow, there''s always a\
  \ small paper crane, fox, or star waiting near {6} bunk, inside DropShips maintenance panels, or\
  \ tucked into the ammo crates. "Figure if we''re always breaking things," {2} says with a shrug,\
  \ folding another, "I might as well make something for a change."
ORIGAMI.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s hands are steady in combat, but after the fight, when\
  \ the dust settles and the dead are counted, they start to tremble. So {2} folds. One precise\
  \ crease at a time, one careful movement after another, until the shaking stops. It doesn''t erase\
  \ what {2}''s done. But for a moment, it feels like {2}''s creating something instead of destroying\
  \ it.
ORIGAMI.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s paperwork is always impeccable - and folded. Orders come\
  \ with little paper animals. Logs arrive with tiny folded stars attached. No one asks why {2}\
  \ does it, but no one throws them away, either.
ORIGAMI.description.1.SUPPORT=Long shifts, tight deadlines, and endless problems - {0} copes\
  \ by folding. A few seconds between tasks, a break between work cycles, even during long\
  \ meetings, {6} fingers move, folding something small, something precise. It doesn''t interfere\
  \ with {6} work. If anything, it seems to help {4} focus.
ORIGAMI.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t know if anyone will remember {4} when this is all\
  \ over. The company, the contracts, the war - it all grinds people down, leaves no trace of them\
  \ behind. But maybe, just maybe, one of {6} paper cranes will still be sitting on a shelf long\
  \ after {2}''s gone. Maybe that''s enough.

OVER_PLANNER.label=Obsessive Over-Planner
OVER_PLANNER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just have a battle plan - {2} has twelve. If the\
  \ enemy flanks, if they get pinned down, if weather conditions shift unexpectedly - {2}''s already\
  \ thought it through. {5} {8} used to roll their eyes at {6} paranoia, but after surviving one\
  \ too many ambushes thanks to {0}''s foresight, they don''t complain anymore.
OVER_PLANNER.description.1.COMBATANT=Before the mission even begins, {0} has already memorized the\
  \ terrain, accounted for ammo reserves, and assigned every comrade a secondary role in case the\
  \ plan goes sideways. "You think too much," someone mutters. {1} doesn''t argue. Thinking too much\
  \ is why {2}''s still alive.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} remembers the battles that went wrong. The ones where no\
  \ one planned for an enemy counterattack, where the extraction route collapsed, where people died\
  \ because no one thought ahead. Now, {2} plans for everything. If {2} covers every angle, maybe {2}\
  \ won''t have to carve another name into the side of {6} helmet.
OVER_PLANNER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s plans aren''t just good - they''re flawless. Every task is\
  \ mapped with maximum efficiency, every request is cross-checked with projected future needs.\
  \ "You can''t just plan for today," {2} mutters, marking another contingency on {6} datapad. "You\
  \ have to plan for six months from now."
OVER_PLANNER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} refuses to let anything be left to chance. {1}''s mapped out\
  \ every possible outcome, every risk, and probably has a backup plan for {6} backup plan. No one\
  \ argues with {4} anymore - not because they agree, but because {2} always wins.
OVER_PLANNER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} plans too much because {2} knows what happens when people\
  \ don''t. The battle they weren''t ready for. The wounded they didn''t have enough supplies for. The\
  \ time {2} wasn''t fast enough, smart enough, prepared enough to stop what was coming. So now, {2}\
  \ plans for everything. Because if {2} misses something again, {2} might not be able to live with\
  \ it.

OVEREXPLAINER.label=Chronic Overexplainer
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0.COMBATANT="{0}, what''s the plan?" Instead of a quick response, {6}\
  \ {8} gets every possible detail. Terrain conditions, enemy positioning, historical precedent\
  \ for similar battles. By the time {2}''s done explaining, the fight has already started.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just call out targets - {2} explains why they''re the\
  \ priority. {1} doesn''t just suggest a strategy - {2} details every reason it works. {5} {8}\
  \ appreciates the thought, but sometimes they just want to hear "Shoot that guy" instead of a\
  \ five-minute breakdown of flanking maneuvers.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to assume orders were clear. Then {2} watched people\
  \ die because they weren''t. Now, {2} explains everything, over and over, ensuring there''s zero\
  \ room for misinterpretation. It makes {4} insufferable. But if it saves even one more life, {2}\
  \ can live with that.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.0.SUPPORT="You want more supplies? Let me explain the supply chain\
  \ constraints affecting that." {0} doesn''t just approve or deny requests - {2} breaks down why\
  \ certain items are in short supply, how much fuel it takes to move them, and how much worse it\
  \ could be. No one asks for clarification anymore because it never ends.
OVEREXPLAINER.description.1.SUPPORT=Need something done? {0} will absolutely do it - but not before\
  \ explaining exactly why it needed to be done, how it should be prevented, and the entire history\
  \ of the problems like this. "{0}, can you just do it?" "Yes, but first, you need to understand\
  \ the problem."
OVEREXPLAINER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} explains everything because if {2} stops talking, {2} might\
  \ have to think. About the war. About how many people {2}''s known up who didn''t make it. About the\
  \ numbers on the payroll sheet that keep shrinking. So {2} fills the silence with words, drowning\
  \ out the thoughts {2} doesn''t want to face.

PEN_CLICKER.label=Habitual Pen Clicker
PEN_CLICKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s pen clicks in steady rhythm while {2} processes a battle\
  \ plan, studies an enemy formation, or reviews battlecam footage. Click. Click. Click. It''s not\
  \ nerves - it''s focus. {5} {8} knows that if the clicking stops, it means {2}''s either figured\
  \ something out - or something''s about to go very wrong.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn''t matter if {2}''s in a war room, a cockpit, or an\
  \ active battlefield - if {0} has a pen, {2}''s clicking it. "Do you have to do that?" someone\
  \ groans during a mission briefing. "Yes," {2} says, still clicking. They don''t believe {4}, but\
  \ {2} never stops.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2.COMBATANT=The battlefield is chaos. Orders shift, people die, plans fall\
  \ apart - but {0}''s pen still clicks, a tiny, steady noise in the storm. Click. Click. Click. A\
  \ reminder that {2}''s still here, still thinking, still in control of something. If {2} stops, {2}\
  \ might have to face the things {2} can''t control. And that''s not an option.
PEN_CLICKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Every request, every review, every inventory count - click, click,\
  \ click. {0} doesn''t even realize {2}''s doing it. But if you hear the rapid-fire clicking of a\
  \ pen, you know {2}''s deep in thought, solving a problem no one else has noticed yet.
PEN_CLICKER.description.1.SUPPORT=Meetings, briefings, payroll discussions - {0}''s pen clicks\
  \ through all of them. "You''re driving me insane," someone mutters. "Am I?" Click. No one has\
  \ been brave enough to steal the pen yet, but the betting pool on who tries first is growing.
PEN_CLICKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s pen is always in motion, always clicking, because if it\
  \ isn''t, {6} hands start to shake. If {2} stops, the silence creeps in, bringing thoughts {2}\
  \ doesn''t want. So {2} clicks. {1} clicks while signing off reports. {1} clicks while logging\
  \ another failed task. {1} clicks because if {2} stops, {2} might not start again.

PEN_TWIRLER.label=Habitual Pen Twirler
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s fingers are always in motion, twirling a pen with the\
  \ same precision {2} uses to fire a weapon. {5} {8} swears {2} could take down an enemy just by\
  \ flicking it hard enough. If the pen stops moving, it means {2}''s actually paying attention - and\
  \ that''s when people start getting nervous.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.1.COMBATANT=It doesn''t matter if {2}''s in a battle briefing, riding in a\
  \ DropShip, or crouched behind cover while autocannons roar overhead - {0}''s pen twirls between\
  \ {6} fingers like {2} hasn''t just been shot at. "Do you ever stop that?" someone asks. "Haven''t\
  \ dropped it yet," {2} replies, spinning it again without looking.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} hands busy because if they stop, {6} mind\
  \ wanders. Back to the names {2}''s crossed out. Back to the missions that went wrong. So {2} spins\
  \ the pen. Over and over. Faster. Slower. Anything to keep {6} fingers moving, to keep the\
  \ silence from creeping in.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just process requests - {2} performs them, flipping a\
  \ pen through {6} fingers while rattling off numbers. Spin. Catch. Somehow, {2} never drops it.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.1.SUPPORT=Whether {2}''s filling out paperwork, troubleshooting, or giving a\
  \ report, {0}''s pen never stops spinning. "That''s going to fly out of your hand one day,"\
  \ someone says. "Not today," {2} replies, flipping it behind {6} back and catching it without\
  \ looking.
PEN_TWIRLER.description.2.SUPPORT=The numbers keep getting worse. The casualty lists keep getting\
  \ longer. The debts pile up, the supplies run low, the repairs take longer every time. {0}\
  \ can''t fix it all, but {2} can spin the pen, keep it moving, keep something predictable in a\
  \ universe that refuses to be.

PERSONIFICATION.label=Overly Friendly with Equipment
PERSONIFICATION.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just maintain {6} gear - {2} talks to it. "Alright,\
  \ sweetheart, let''s not jam on me today." {5} sidearm gets a pep talk before every battle, and\
  \ {6} knife? {1}''s got a name for that, too. {5} {8} has stopped questioning it - it seems to work.
PERSONIFICATION.description.1.COMBATANT=
PERSONIFICATION.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s comrades keep dying. {5} gear? it stays. So {2} talks to\
  \ it, maintains it with care, treats it like they''re alive - because at least they won''t bleed out\
  \ on {4}. At least they won''t leave.
PERSONIFICATION.description.0.SUPPORT="Alright, my beauties, let''s see what we''ve got today," {0}\
  \ grins as {2} opens another shipment. No matter what they are, each new tool gets an\
  \ introduction, a small moment of appreciation. "You don''t have to talk to the equipment,"\
  \ someone says. "And you don''t have to breathe," {2} shoots back, continuing {6} inventory.
PERSONIFICATION.description.1.SUPPORT={0} chats with the equipment. "C''mon, don''t do this to me\
  \ now," {2} mutters while smacking a console. "I just fixed you." The weird part? It actually\
  \ seems to work.
PERSONIFICATION.description.2.SUPPORT={0} used to joke with {6} {8}. Used to trade stories, give\
  \ pep talks, laugh. Now, the machines get all of that. They don''t die. They don''t betray. They\
  \ don''t leave {4} behind. So {2} talks to them like they''re real, because if {2} doesn''t... the\
  \ silence might finally break {4}.

PESSIMIST.label=Habitual Pessimist
PESSIMIST.description.0.COMBATANT="We''re walking into a trap," {0} mutters as the mission\
  \ briefing ends. "How do you know?" someone asks. "Because we''re still breathing - means the\
  \ universe isn''t done screwing with us yet." No matter the odds, no matter how good things look,\
  \ {0} is always prepared for something to go wrong.
PESSIMIST.description.1.COMBATANT="We won the battle, {0}, lighten up." {1} shakes {6} head.\
  \ "Sure, but now we''re low on ammo, our Mek are trashed, and command''s gonna send us into an\
  \ even worse fight next time. We never actually win - we just survive until the next mess." The\
  \ worst part? {1}''s usually right
PESSIMIST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just pessimistic - {2}''s realistic. {1}''s seen\
  \ victories turn to disasters, seen friends make promises they didn''t live to keep. So when {2}\
  \ sighs and mutters, "This won''t end well," it''s not cynicism. It''s experience. And it''s another\
  \ name {2}''s getting ready to cross out.
PESSIMIST.description.0.SUPPORT="We''ve got enough fuel for the next campaign, {0}." {1} scoffs.\
  \ "Assuming we don''t get shorted on the next shipment, or the price spikes, or some idiot burns\
  \ through half our reserves on a miscalculation." If there''s a way for things to go wrong,\
  \ {0}''s already considered it twice.
PESSIMIST.description.1.SUPPORT=If something actually goes smoothly, {0} gets nervous. "This\
  \ was too easy," {2} mutters while reviewing logs. "Nothing ever works this well. Either we missed\
  \ something, or something''s about to hit the fan." No one takes {4} seriously - until {2}''s right.\
  \ Again.
PESSIMIST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} wasn''t always like this. {1} used to hope. Used to think\
  \ things might turn around. Then {2} counted too many empty bunks, saw too many names vanish from\
  \ payroll, lost too many shipments that never arrived. Now? {1} just assumes the worst. It''s\
  \ easier that way. At least it means {2}''s never surprised.

PHRASES.label=Tends to Use Specific Phrases
PHRASES.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s {8} can predict {6} responses before {2} even speaks.\
  \ "This is gonna suck." "If I die, delete my debts." "Oh great, another suicide mission." {5}\
  \ catchphrases aren''t just habit - they''re a coping mechanism. When everything else is chaos, at\
  \ least {6} words stay the same.
PHRASES.description.1.COMBATANT="A bad plan executed well beats a good plan executed poorly."\
  \ "Information is ammunition!" "Nobody wins in war, they just get to fight the next one." {0}''s\
  \ phrases aren''t original, but they stick. New recruits pick them up without realizing it, until\
  \ suddenly they''re repeating {6} words on the battlefield.
PHRASES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} wasn''t always like this. {5} phrases? They weren''t {6}\
  \ first. Some belonged to comrades who aren''t around anymore. Some were last words. Some were\
  \ muttered over comms, half-forgotten in the haze of war. {1} says them because if {2} doesn''t,\
  \ those people are truly gone.
PHRASES.description.0.SUPPORT="Do I look like a magician?" "You want it done when? Hah."\
  \ "Sure, I''ll pull that out of my magic supply crate full of things we don''t have." {0} has a\
  \ standard rotation of responses to requests, all variations of ''You''re not getting what you\
  \ want, but I''ll try anyway.''
PHRASES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has {6} go-to lines. "Not my problem - until it is." "You\
  \ break it, you bought it." "This wasn''t in my job description, and yet, here I am." At this\
  \ point, {6} coworkers just accept it as part of the job.
PHRASES.description.2.SUPPORT="It''ll hold." "We''ll figure something out." "Things''ll work\
  \ out." {0} repeats the same reassurances over and over, not because {2} believes them, but\
  \ because it''s what people need to hear. {1} knows the truth. But saying it wouldn''t help anyone,\
  \ least of all {4}self.

PLANTS.label=Loves Plants
PLANTS.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s gear is always pristine, {6} sidearm\
  \ well-maintained - right next to a small potted plant {2} keeps in {6} bunk. "Everything else in\
  \ this job dies," {2} says, misting its leaves. "Might as well keep one thing alive." {5} {8}\
  \ teases {4}, but they''ve also learned not to mess with it.
PLANTS.description.1.COMBATANT="That''s a snake plant. Tough as hell, doesn''t need much,\
  \ survives in low light. Kind of like us." {0}''s the type to compare a campaign to crop\
  \ rotation and an ambush to invasive species competition. {5} {8} has learned to just nod along\
  \ when {2} starts explaining plant biology mid-mission.
PLANTS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has taken so many lives. Bombed forests, scorched\
  \ farmland, turned green fields into battlefields. So {2} grows plants - not to ba{8} the scales\
  \ (nothing could), but to remind {4}self that creation is still possible. That not everything has\
  \ to be reduced to ash.
PLANTS.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s storage room isn''t just crates and tools - it''s also full\
  \ of plants. "They help with air quality," {2} claims, watering a row of succulents next to a rack\
  \ of medical supplies. Everyone lets it slide because, honestly? It does make the place feel less\
  \ miserable.
PLANTS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} always finds time to check {6} plants. "You''re looking\
  \ real good today, buddy," {2} murmurs to a sprouting seedling. {5} coworkers have long since\
  \ stopped questioning it - unless they catch {4} slipping extra water rations for them.
PLANTS.description.2.SUPPORT=Plants don''t fight. They don''t betray. They don''t die screaming.\
  \ {0} grows them because they''re simple. Because in a life where everything falls apart,\
  \ they''re the only thing that doesn''t ask anything of {4}. {1} doesn''t expect to survive this war.\
  \ But maybe, just maybe, {6} plants will.

POLITE.label=Excessive Politeness
POLITE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} thanks the quartermaster when {2} picks up {6} ammunition,\
  \ apologizes when {2} shoots an enemy, and says "excuse me" when shoving someone out of the way of\
  \ an incoming missile. {5} {8} doesn''t understand how {2} manages to be so polite while covered\
  \ in blood and dust, but at this point, it''s just {6} thing.
POLITE.description.1.COMBATANT="Pardon me, but I believe that''s my cover." "Terribly sorry,\
  \ but I am about to fire at you." {0}''s enemies don''t know how to handle the fact that {2}''s\
  \ alarmingly courteous while actively trying to kill them. {5} {8} swears that one day, an\
  \ enemy will surrender just because they feel bad for interrupting {6} manners.
POLITE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} says "please" and "thank you" because everything else\
  \ about {6} life is brutal. The orders, the fighting, the constant death - none of it feels right.\
  \ But if {2} can still show some basic decency, if {2} can still be civilized, then maybe {2} hasn''t\
  \ lost {4}self to the war completely.
POLITE.description.0.SUPPORT="I do regret to inform you that we are completely out of spare\
  \ batteries, and I deeply apologize for any inconvenience this may cause." {0} speaks like {2}''s\
  \ declining a dinner invitation. Somehow, {6} tone makes it even more frustrating.
POLITE.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s manners never drop. {1} refers to rookies as "sir" and\
  \ "ma''am," always prefaces bad news with deeply formal condolences, and thanks people for their\
  \ patience - even when they definitely don''t have any.
POLITE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows how cruel the world is. {1}''s seen what happens when\
  \ people stop caring, stop being human. So {2} clings to formality, to pleasantries, to basic\
  \ courtesy. {1} bows {6} head when passing the dead, murmurs "I''m so sorry" when patching up\
  \ another wounded soldier. If {2} stops being polite, {2}''s afraid of what {2}''ll become.

PRACTICAL_JOKER.label=Loves Practical Jokes
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} takes warfare very seriously - right up until the moment {2}\
  \ tapes over someone''s targeting reticle with a tiny, smiling skull sticker. {5} {8} knows that\
  \ if things have been too quiet, someone is about to find their personal comms blasting\
  \ MekWarrior recruitment jingles in the middle of battle.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} rigs the barracks door to announce everyone''s full rank\
  \ and name when they enter. {1} swaps someone''s comm ID so they sound exactly like the unit\
  \ commander. Even in the middle of a war, {2} finds ways to make people laugh - because sometimes,\
  \ that''s the only thing keeping them from breaking.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} pranks because if {2} stops, {2}''ll have to process the\
  \ horror around {4}. Every practical joke is a distraction, a way to keep things light even when\
  \ the air feels like death. The day {0} stops joking is the day {6} {8} knows things have\
  \ truly gone to hell.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.0.SUPPORT=Here''s your mission briefings, and a surprise!" {0} grins as a\
  \ warrior opens the box to find a single bright pink paint can labeled ''EXPERIMENTAL CAMO.'' {1}''s\
  \ mastered the art of harmless, mildly infuriating pranks - but never enough to get {4}self\
  \ actually fired.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} reroutes coffee machine settings so they all dispense\
  \ decaf, rearranges locker labels just slightly, and convinces rookies that "JumpShip gravity\
  \ loss training" involves sprinting toward a bulkhead wall. No one''s safe - but somehow, they all\
  \ love {4} for it.
PRACTICAL_JOKER.description.2.SUPPORT=The budget''s failing. People are dying. Morale is nonexistent.\
  \ {0} keeps joking because someone has to. Someone has to keep something light in a world that\
  \ only gets darker. Because the moment no one laughs at {6} pranks anymore... that''s when {2} knows\
  \ it''s really over.

PREPARED.label=Always Prepared
PREPARED.description.0.COMBATANT=Need extra ammo? {0} already packed it. Medkit? Right here.\
  \ Contingency for if the mission inevitably goes sideways? {1}''s got a plan. {5} {8} has learned\
  \ that if {0} tells them to carry an extra power cell, they don''t ask why - they just do it.
PREPARED.description.1.COMBATANT="Check your seals. Check your ammo. Check everything twice,"\
  \ {0} reminds {6} team every deployment. {1} isn''t paranoid - {2}''s survived enough bad situations\
  \ to know that being unprepared is just another way of asking to die.
PREPARED.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just prepared - {2}''s ready for everything. Because\
  \ {2}''s seen what happens when people aren''t. The last time someone forgot to check their\
  \ equipment, they didn''t come back. The last time a {8} got sloppy, they left a graveyard\
  \ behind. {1} won''t make those mistakes. {1} can''t afford to.
PREPARED.description.0.SUPPORT="You''re gonna want an extra medkit," {0} says, handing it over\
  \ before the MekWarrior even asks. "How did you - ?" "Because I know you." {5} ability to\
  \ anticipate needs borders on psychic. No one questions it.
PREPARED.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never leaves anything to chance. {1} doesn''t just have a\
  \ backup plan - {2} has three. "Hope for the best," {2} mutters, sealing another redundant supply\
  \ crate, "but prepare for the worst."
PREPARED.description.2.SUPPORT={0} stocks extra bandages because {2}''s watched people bleed\
  \ out when there weren''t enough. {1} double-checks oxygen reserves because {2}''s seen what\
  \ suffocation looks like. {1} prepares not because {2}''s cautious - but because {2} knows what happens\
  \ when you''re not.

PUNCTUAL.label=Overly Punctual
PUNCTUAL.description.0.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just on time for deployments - {2}''s early. While the\
  \ rest of the {8} rolls in groggy and adjusting their gear, {2}''s already double-checking {6}\
  \ weapons, reviewing the mission plan, and glaring at anyone who thinks "five minutes late" is\
  \ acceptable.
PUNCTUAL.description.1.COMBATANT="Being late is the fastest way to get killed." {0} drills it\
  \ into every rookie {2} meets. In war, seconds matter - hesitate, delay, miss your mark, and you''re\
  \ dead. {5} {8} jokes that {2} sets {6} watch five minutes fast just to make sure {2}''s never\
  \ late. They''re only half wrong.
PUNCTUAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} once showed up late to a fight. {1} doesn''t talk about\
  \ what happened afterward, but {6} unit didn''t walk away intact. Now, {2}''s never late. Never\
  \ behind. Never a second off schedule. Because if {2} is, it means someone else might not make it.\
  \ And {2} refuses to let that happen again.
PUNCTUAL.description.0.SUPPORT=If {0} says a report will be ready at 0600, it''s ready at\
  \ 0600. Not a second later. Anyone who dares show up late for a job gets the look - the one that\
  \ says you are now the reason my entire system is off by 45 seconds, and I will remember this.
PUNCTUAL.description.1.SUPPORT=Every shift, every meeting, every single task in {0}''s day\
  \ runs exactly on schedule. If {2} says a task takes 32 minutes, it takes 32 minutes. "It''s about\
  \ efficiency," {2} mutters as {2} checks {6} watch for the third time in a minute. {5} coworkers\
  \ have learned that if you''re late, you might as well not show up at all.
PUNCTUAL.description.2.SUPPORT={0} is never late because if {2}''s always busy, always moving,\
  \ always on schedule, {2} doesn''t have to think about the people who are never showing up again.\
  \ {1} fills {6} time, controls it down to the second, because if {2} ever lets {4}self fall behind,\
  \ {2} might start remembering what {2}''s lost.

PUZZLES.label=Obsessed with Puzzles
PUZZLES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} analyzes. Enemy formations, terrain\
  \ advantages, supply lines - it''s all one giant puzzle waiting to be unraveled. "Every problem has\
  \ a solution," {2} mutters, adjusting {6} sights. The only question is whether {2} finds it before\
  \ someone gets killed.
PUZZLES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} can''t not try to break things down. {1} spends downtime\
  \ solving riddles, tweaking battle plans, or picking apart mission briefings like they''re\
  \ crossword clues. "It''s just a simple recon op, {0}." {1} shakes {6} head. "That''s what they\
  \ want you to think."
PUZZLES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} needs to solve puzzles, because once, {2} couldn''t. A\
  \ battle gone wrong, a mystery that cost lives, a decision that left {4} with too many empty\
  \ chairs around the table. Now, {2} pieces things together obsessively, trying to prove to {4}self\
  \ that there''s always a way out - {2} just has to find it in time.
PUZZLES.description.0.SUPPORT=Managing {6} tasks isn''t just a job for {0} - it''s a game. Every\
  \ day is another piece in the ever-changing puzzle of how to keep the company running. {1} doesn''t\
  \ just solve problems - {2} anticipates them.
PUZZLES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} can''t resist a puzzle. "{0}, we need those power cells\
  \ moved." "Sure thing - oh, but look at this encryption key, someone tried to hide something\
  \ here..." {5} coworkers have learned to either give {4} puzzles on purpose or rip them out of {6}\
  \ hands before {2} gets lost in them.
PUZZLES.description.2.SUPPORT=A shipment lost, another contract failed, another person missing\
  \ from the roster. {0} can''t fix those things. But {2} can decrypt an old DropShip manifest, or\
  \ solve an old Terran cipher. {1} focuses on the puzzles {2} can solve so {2} doesn''t have to think\
  \ about the ones {2} never will.

QUOTES.label=Collects Quotes
QUOTES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a quote for everything. Before a mission? "Fortune\
  \ favors the bold." After losing a comrade? "War does not determine who is right, only who is\
  \ left." Some find it inspiring. Others wish {2}''d just shut up and fight.
QUOTES.description.1.COMBATANT="Alexander once said - " "{0}, please." Whether it''s an ancient\
  \ philosopher or a forgotten MekWarrior, {2} always has a quote to fit the situation. {5} {8}\
  \ tolerates it because, somehow, {6} endless library of words actually makes them think.
QUOTES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just collect quotes - {2} clings to them. They''re\
  \ the words of people who survived, who understood the world before {4}. Repeating them means {2}\
  \ doesn''t have to come up with {6} own answers. Because if {2} did, {2} might have to admit {2}\
  \ doesn''t have any left.
QUOTES.description.0.SUPPORT="Request approved. ''walk softly and carry a big gun.''" Every\
  \ document {0} signs comes with an extra line of borrowed wisdom. No one''s sure why {2} does it,\
  \ but it''s hard to be mad when a report arrives exactly as promised, with just the right words\
  \ attached.
QUOTES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} always has a quote ready. "A stitch in time saves nine."\
  \ "No plan survives first contact with the enemy." {1} insists they''re relevant. {5} coworkers\
  \ suspect {2} just enjoys the theatrics.
QUOTES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} writes down quotes because {2}''s afraid the voices of the\
  \ past will disappear. Commanders, poets, warriors - they all left something behind. Something\
  \ worth remembering. Because if their words can last, maybe - just maybe - something about {4} will,\
  \ too.

RARELY_SLEEPS.label=Rarely Sleeps
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} claims {2} can''t sleep. "Too much to do, not enough time,"\
  \ {2} mutters, rubbing exhaustion from {6} eyes. Yet somehow, despite the late nights and early\
  \ deployments, {2} never misses a mission. {5} {8} doesn''t know how {2} keeps going, but they''re\
  \ starting to think {2} might not, for much longer.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1.COMBATANT=Sleep is for people who don''t have things to worry about. {0}\
  \ is up before dawn, checking weapons, analyzing enemy movements, running drills in {6} head.\
  \ "You should sleep, {0}." "So should you," {2} fires back, sipping something definitely\
  \ stronger than coffee.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} closes {6} eyes and sees them - the dead, the battles gone\
  \ wrong, the faces of those who won''t be in the next deployment. So {2} doesn''t sleep. {1} just\
  \ keeps moving, keeps planning, keeps doing something, because the moment {2} stops, the memories\
  \ will catch up.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.0.SUPPORT=Need something at 3 AM? {0}''s already awake. No one knows when\
  \ {2} sleeps, only that {2}''s always at {6} desk, fixing problems before anyone else even notices\
  \ them. "{0}, go to bed." "Bed''s more of a suggestion than a location."
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats sleep as optional. "We''ve got deadlines." "We''ve\
  \ got a mission." "We''ve got so much work to do." {1} pushes {4}self harder than anyone else and\
  \ gets frustrated when others can''t keep up. Not because {2}''s angry - because if they need sleep,\
  \ that means {2}''s doing something wrong.
RARELY_SLEEPS.description.2.SUPPORT=Sleep is surrender. Sleep is vulnerability. Sleep is trusting\
  \ that when {2} wakes up, everything won''t have collapsed overnight. {0} doesn''t trust that\
  \ anymore. {1} keeps moving, keeps working, keeps doing something, because stopping? Stopping\
  \ means realizing just how bad things really are.

ROUTINE.label=Has a Routine for Small Tasks
ROUTINE.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every battle, {0} follows the same sequence-adjust {6}\
  \ gloves twice, tighten {6} straps in the same order, tap {6} helmet once. "Superstition?"\
  \ someone asks. "No," {2} replies. "Just making sure everything''s right." But {6} {8} knows-if\
  \ {6} routine is ever disrupted, {2}''s off {6} game.
ROUTINE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} preps {6} weapons the exact same way before every\
  \ mission. Field strips, recalibrates, reloads-even if they don''t need it. "Why do you keep doing\
  \ that?" someone asks. {1} shrugs. "Routine keeps you sharp." What {2} doesn''t say? Without it,\
  \ the battlefield feels too unpredictable.
ROUTINE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has to do things in order-check gear, stretch, reload,\
  \ adjust {6} HUD, breathe. If {2} doesn''t? The battlefield feels wrong. War is chaos, loss,\
  \ failure. But if {2} can control one thing, just one, maybe it''ll be enough to keep {4}self\
  \ together.
ROUTINE.description.0.SUPPORT=No one interrupts {0}''s process. Supply check at 0600. Ration\
  \ logs at 0730. Gear inspections exactly at 1100. Any change to the order? Unacceptable. "{0},\
  \ can''t you skip a step?" "No," {2} says flatly, already organizing another routine.
ROUTINE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has an unbreakable routine. "It''s efficient," {2} claims.\
  \ But if someone tries to rush {4}, {2} still sticks to {6} routine. "Break the order," {2}\
  \ mutters, "and that''s when things go wrong."
ROUTINE.description.2.SUPPORT=The company is bleeding resources. The pay is late. Another bunk\
  \ is empty. {0} can''t stop the decline, but {2} can follow {6} routines. If the paperwork is\
  \ done just right, if the tools are placed exactly where they belong, if {2} does everything in\
  \ perfect sequence-maybe it''ll feel like things aren''t slipping away.

SEEKS_APPROVAL.label=Constantly Seeking Approval
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0.COMBATANT=Every time {0} lands a shot or executes an order, {6} eyes\
  \ flick toward {6} {8}. "Good call, right?" "That was the right move, yeah?" {1}''s skilled, damn\
  \ skilled, but {2} still needs to hear it-needs someone to confirm that {2}''s doing the right thing.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1.COMBATANT={0} knows what {2}''s doing, but {2} still asks. "You sure about\
  \ this plan?" "We''re really going in now?" {1} won''t commit until someone gives {4} a nod, a pat\
  \ on the shoulder, anything to prove {2}''s not messing up. {1}''s not afraid of battle-{2}''s afraid\
  \ of disappointing someone.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what happens to warriors who fail. The ones who\
  \ weren''t good enough. The ones who made the wrong call. The ones whose names are scratched off\
  \ the roster and never spoken again. So {2} asks-constantly, obsessively-because if no one tells\
  \ {4} {2}''s doing well, maybe {2}''s next.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.0.SUPPORT="I got everything squared away ahead of schedule-was that\
  \ helpful?" "I prioritized the tool shipments over the rations-was that the right call?" {0}\
  \ knows {2}''s efficient, but {2} still needs someone to tell {4} {2} made the right decision.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a report ready to go, job fully handled, and manifests\
  \ double-checked-but {2} won''t submit anything without someone approving it first. "Just want to\
  \ make sure it''s right," {2} says, waiting for a nod before proceeding. It slows things down, but\
  \ {2} can''t help it.
SEEKS_APPROVAL.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t ask for validation because {2} enjoys it-{2} asks\
  \ because {2} needs it. Because in a world where people disappear overnight, where names get wiped\
  \ off records like they never existed, {2} has to hear that {2}''s useful. That {2}''s needed. Because\
  \ if {2} isn''t, then what''s keeping {4} from vanishing next?

SENTIMENTAL.label=Overly Sentimental
SENTIMENTAL.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s locker is full of small, seemingly insignificant\
  \ items-a spent shell casing from {6} first battle, a scrap of fabric from an old unit patch, a\
  \ dented dog tag that isn''t {6}. "They''re just reminders," {2} says when asked. Reminders of what,\
  \ {2} never says.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1.COMBATANT={0} names {6} weapons, personalizes {6} armor, and refuses to\
  \ let go of anything with history. {5} comrades? {1} remembers every detail about them-their\
  \ favorite drinks, the songs they hum, the reasons they fight. Losing someone breaks {4} a little\
  \ more each time.
SENTIMENTAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} refuses to throw anything away-every scrap, every\
  \ trinket, every memory means something. Because war erases people. It wipes them out. And if {2}\
  \ doesn''t hold onto what little remains, who will?
SENTIMENTAL.description.0.SUPPORT="This laser''s been with us since the second campaign. You do not\
  \ just toss it aside." {0} treats old gear with reverence, patching up damaged equipment long\
  \ past its prime because it deserves better than to be scrapped.
SENTIMENTAL.description.1.SUPPORT={0} remembers birthdays, keeps old rosters even when people\
  \ are long gone, and still refers to former coworkers like they just left. "They were good\
  \ people," {2} says, voice a little too soft. "They mattered."
SENTIMENTAL.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has a list. Names of every soldier {2}''s known, every MedTech\
  \ who''s patched them up, every mechanic who''s worked on their gear. {1} reads it sometimes,\
  \ whispering each name like a prayer. {1} has to remember them-because someday, there won''t be\
  \ anyone left who does.

SHARPENING.label=Compulsive Sharpening
SHARPENING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just prepared-{2}''s precise. Every knife, or tool in\
  \ {6} kit is honed to perfection. {1} sharpens {6} combat blade before every mission, during\
  \ downtime, and even mid-briefing. {5} {8} jokes that {2}''d sharpen a laser if {2} could.
SHARPENING.description.1.COMBATANT=When {0} isn''t in battle, {2}''s sitting with a whetstone,\
  \ running it over the edge of {6} blade again and again. It doesn''t matter if it''s already\
  \ sharp-{2} keeps at it anyway. It''s not about the blade. It''s about the motion, the control, the\
  \ focus. {5} team has learned that if {0}''s sharpening in silence, it''s best to leave {4} be.
SHARPENING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} can''t control the war. {1} can''t stop people from dying.\
  \ But {2} can make sure {6} weapon is sharp. Every pass of the stone, every adjustment to the\
  \ angle-it''s something tangible, something real, something that won''t fail {4}. Because in a\
  \ universe where everything else falls apart, at least {6} blade will always be ready.
SHARPENING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} insists that everything stays sharp. Knives? Obviously.\
  \ Tools? Absolutely. A can opener? You bet. {1}''s been caught sharpening wrenches before, and no\
  \ one knows if {2}''s serious or if {2} just needs to keep something in motion.
SHARPENING.description.1.SUPPORT=Whether {2}''s fixing equipment, sorting supplies, or handling a\
  \ task, {0} always has something in {6} hands, sharpening it absentmindedly. "{0}, is that a\
  \ machete?" "Yep." "Why are you sharpening it?" {1} doesn''t answer. {1} just keeps going.
SHARPENING.description.2.SUPPORT=The war grinds people down, but {0} grinds steel. If {6} hands\
  \ are busy, {6} mind isn''t dwelling on the latest casualty report, the missing shipments, the\
  \ debts stacking up. So {2} sharpens. And sharpens. And sharpens. Because if {2} stops, the\
  \ thoughts catch up.

SINGS.label=Sings to Themselves
SINGS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} sings softly, barely audible over the crackle of comms.\
  \ It''s an old war tune, a bar song, or some half-forgotten melody from a planet {2} barely\
  \ remembers. The {8} knows that if they hear {4} singing, the fight hasn''t really started yet.\
  \ If {2} stops? That''s when things have gone bad.
SINGS.description.1.COMBATANT="{0}, why are you singing right now?" "Because it helps me\
  \ focus." It doesn''t matter if they''re pinned down or charging into an ambush-{0} always has a\
  \ song under {6} breath, a slow and steady rhythm that somehow makes the chaos around {4} seem a\
  \ little more manageable.
SINGS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} sings because silence means remembering. It means\
  \ thinking about the battles {2} barely survived, the people who didn''t, the wreckage left behind.\
  \ The melody keeps those thoughts at bay, drowns out the ghosts whispering in the quiet. If {2}\
  \ ever stops singing, it''s because there''s no one left to sing for.
SINGS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} works to a tune, humming as {2} clears the rota, whistling\
  \ while fixing manifest errors, occasionally breaking into full song when the numbers actually\
  \ ba{8} for once. No one''s sure if {2} even realizes {2}''s doing it, but at this point, {6}\
  \ coworkers consider it part of the daily routine.
SINGS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hums constantly. Sometimes it''s an old folk song,\
  \ sometimes it''s entirely made up, but it''s always there. "It helps me concentrate," {2} says. {5}\
  \ coworkers don''t mind-it makes the long shifts feel a little less empty.
SINGS.description.2.SUPPORT=The war grinds people down. Names disappear from rosters, beds\
  \ go empty, another late-night report comes in full of losses. {0} sings because if {2} stops,\
  \ {2}''ll have to process it all. As long as the song keeps going, so does {2}.

SKEPTICAL.label=Chronically Skeptical
SKEPTICAL.description.0.COMBATANT="Smooth operation, minimal resistance," the commander says.\
  \ {0} scoffs. "Uh-huh. And I suppose the enemy didn''t get the memo?" {1}''s heard too many\
  \ promises of ''easy missions'' that turned into bloodbaths. {1} doesn''t assume disaster-{2} just\
  \ prepares for it every time.
SKEPTICAL.description.1.COMBATANT="We''re supposed to trust intel from who?" {0} demands, arms\
  \ crossed. If a plan sounds too clean, {2} assumes it''s wrong. If an enemy retreats too fast, {2}\
  \ assumes they''re baiting them in. {1}''s not paranoid, {2} insists-{2}''s just still alive.
SKEPTICAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} trusts no one-not command, not locals, not even {6} own\
  \ allies completely. Too many times, the people {2} relied on turned out to be lying, compromised,\
  \ or already dead. So now? Now {2} assumes everything is a trick until proven otherwise.
SKEPTICAL.description.0.SUPPORT="The shipment''s ''on schedule?'' Sure, I''ll believe it when I see\
  \ it." {0} assumes every delivery is late, every contract is skewed, and every report is\
  \ missing critical details. {1}''s never pleasantly surprised-but {2}''s also never unprepared.
SKEPTICAL.description.1.SUPPORT="The convoy''s fine? The system''s stable? Uh-huh, sure." {0}\
  \ checks everything twice, then once more just in case. If someone insists a problem is solved,\
  \ {2} immediately assumes it isn''t. {5} coworkers roll their eyes-until {2} catches an issue they\
  \ swore wasn''t there.
SKEPTICAL.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s been told things would get better. That command would\
  \ come through. That there was enough time, enough resources, enough hope. None of it was true.\
  \ So now, {2} trusts nothing at face value. Because the one time {2} does? That''s when it''ll all\
  \ come crashing down.

SLEEP_TALKER.label=Talks in Sleep
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s {8} has learned not to bunk near {4} unless they want\
  \ to hear a full mission replay at 3 AM. "Take the flank-no, not that way! Damn it-" {1} barks\
  \ commands, mutters tactics, and sometimes lets out a low chuckle-like {2} just won a fight that\
  \ never happened.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} sleeps, but {6} brain doesn''t. {1} mutters coordinates,\
  \ lists off supply counts, or recites mission orders word for word. "{0}, you were telling us\
  \ where to take cover in your sleep." {1} shrugs. "Yeah? And was I wrong?"
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT=Sometimes {0}''s voice is barely a whisper. Names. Places.\
  \ Pleas. Things that shouldn''t be heard. Those who wake up and listen know better than to mention\
  \ it in the morning. Because whatever {2}''s remembering? It''s something {2} can''t let go of.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT="Check the manifests. Who authorized that last shipment?" {0}\
  \ doesn''t just talk in {6} sleep-{2} works in it. {5} bunkmates have stopped waking {4} up,\
  \ choosing instead to write down {6} half-conscious ramblings, just in case {2} catches something\
  \ they missed.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s nighttime mumbling is half-practical, half-nonsense. One\
  \ night it''s "Gotta fix that...," the next it''s "Why is the DropShip full of goats?" No one\
  \ knows what {6} brain is doing, but it''s oddly fascinating to listen to.
SLEEP_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t talk about certain things while awake. But when\
  \ sleep takes {4}, {6} mind leaks-regrets, confessions, fears. "Should''ve been me." "We never\
  \ should''ve trusted them." "There''s no way out of this, is there?" {5} coworkers pretend they\
  \ don''t hear. Because what could they possibly say?

SMILER.label=Compulsive Smiler
SMILER.description.0.COMBATANT=Incoming fire? {0} smiles. A brutal melee? {1}''s grinning. No\
  \ one knows if it''s nerves, confidence, or just something deeply wrong with {4}, but when the\
  \ fight gets ugly, {6} smile only gets wider. {5} {8} isn''t sure whether it''s reassuring or\
  \ deeply unsettling.
SMILER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} jokes, grins, and cracks a smirk even when things are\
  \ falling apart. "{0}, we''re pinned down." Smile. "{0}, command just abandoned us." Grin.\
  \ "{0}, what the hell is so funny?" "Nothing," {2} says, still smiling. "What else can we do?"
SMILER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t feel like smiling-{2} has to. The moment {2} stops,\
  \ the moment {6} face falls, it all becomes real. The losses, the hopelessness, the sheer weight\
  \ of it all. So {2} keeps grinning, even when {6} hands shake, even when there''s blood on {6}\
  \ teeth. Because if {2} stops, what''s left?
SMILER.description.0.SUPPORT=Supplies are running low, requests are piling up, another\
  \ detachment isn''t coming back-but {0}''s still smiling. "Don''t worry, we''ll figure it out," {2}\
  \ says, flashing a grin that''s just a little too forced. No one believes {4}.
SMILER.description.1.SUPPORT=Broken equipment, impossible deadlines, an infuriating lack of\
  \ cooperation-{0} just smiles through it all. "{0}, you''re really calm about this." "Oh,\
  \ absolutely," {2} says through clenched teeth, {6} grin unwavering as {2} contemplates murder.
SMILER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} grins even when the walls are closing in, even when the\
  \ company''s debts are unpayable, even when another casualty report crosses {6} desk. "You''re\
  \ always smiling," someone says. "Yeah," {0} replies, still grinning. "Because what happens if\
  \ I stop?"

SNACKS.label=Always Has a Snack
SNACKS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} fights like a professional, but {2} eats like it''s just as\
  \ important. Mid-mission? Ration bar. Briefing? Dried fruit. In the scrum? Protein paste. {5}\
  \ {8} used to think it was weird-until they hit a 16-hour engagement and realized {2} was the\
  \ only one still functioning.
SNACKS.description.1.COMBATANT="{0}, how are you eating right now?" someone shouts as\
  \ bullets whiz overhead. "Gotta keep my energy up," {2} replies, taking another bite of something\
  \ that definitely shouldn''t have survived this long in a combat zone. No one understands how {2}\
  \ does it-but {2} never runs out.
SNACKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} eats because it''s routine. Because it''s something normal\
  \ in a world that isn''t. Because if {2} focuses on unwrapping a snack, just for a moment, it''s not\
  \ about the bodies, the losses, the blood. It''s just food. And if {2} stops? {1} might start\
  \ feeling everything else.
SNACKS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is personally stocked for any situation. "Long shift?\
  \ Here, have a protein bar." "Supply delay? I planned for that." {5} pockets are full of snacks,\
  \ and if you need one, {2}''s got you covered.
SNACKS.description.1.SUPPORT=Explosions outside? Critical system failures? Late-night\
  \ emergency job requests? Doesn''t matter-{0}''s still eating. "How can you think about food\
  \ right now?" someone asks. {1} shrugs, chewing. "Because starving won''t fix it either."
SNACKS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} always eats, even when no one else can stomach it. {1}\
  \ chews as {2} signs off another casualty report. {1} nibbles on dried meat as {2} calculates supply\
  \ losses. Because if {2} keeps eating, keeps living like normal, then maybe-just maybe-things\
  \ aren''t as bad as they look.

STORYTELLING.label=Compulsive Storytelling
STORYTELLING.description.0.COMBATANT="This reminds me of the time we got stuck on an ice world with\
  \ no working weapons and one functional radio..." {0} launches into another tale mid-battle,\
  \ dodging fire as {2} talks. {5} {8} swears {2}''d narrate {6} own death if given the chance.
STORYTELLING.description.1.COMBATANT="You ever hear about the merc who took down a ''Mek\
  \ bare-handed?" {0} asks, grinning. "No? Well, let me tell you..." {1} exaggerates just enough to\
  \ keep things entertaining - but never enough to be sure {2}''s lying.
STORYTELLING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just tell stories - {2} preserves them. The names of\
  \ fallen comrades, the battles no one recorded, the choices that led to who lived and who didn''t.\
  \ If {2} keeps talking, if {2} keeps telling, then maybe they''re not really gone.
STORYTELLING.description.0.SUPPORT="You want more food? That reminds me - back in the Skye conflict,\
  \ a guy exactly like you asked for extra rations. You know what happened next?" By the time {0}\
  \ hands over the request, the poor soldier''s heard a five-minute anecdote.
STORYTELLING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} narrates everything. "This reminds me of a time we had a\
  \ busted coolant line exactly like this - except that time, the guy next to me caught fire..." {5}\
  \ coworkers have learned to just let {4} talk.
STORYTELLING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} collects tales of the past - because someone has to. The\
  \ contracts lost, the MekWarriors who never came back, the deals that went south. If {2} stops\
  \ talking, if {2} stops telling these stories, it''ll be like they never existed at all. And {2}\
  \ refuses to let that happen.

STRETCHING.label=Constantly Stretching
STRETCHING.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s always stretching - before a mission, during briefings,\
  \ even mid-battle. "A stiff body''s a slow body," {2} mutters, rolling {6} shoulders. {1} treats\
  \ combat like a sport - one wrong movement, one cramp at the wrong time, and it could cost {4} {6}\
  \ life.
STRETCHING.description.1.COMBATANT="{0}, we''re about to breach the enemy position."\
  \ Pop - crack - stretch. "Yeah, just gimme a sec." {5} {8} groans as {2} twists {6} torso, arms over\
  \ {6} head, preparing like {2}''s about to jog a marathon instead of charge into gunfire.
STRETCHING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} stretches because it''s something to control. Muscles\
  \ loosen, joints adjust, everything works the way it''s supposed to. Unlike {6} past mistakes.\
  \ Unlike the ghosts {2} keeps running from. {5} body has to be ready - because if it ever locks up,\
  \ so will {2}.
STRETCHING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just handle tasks - {2} prepares for them. Before\
  \ getting to work, before checking manifests, before signing a single form, {2} stretches. "Gotta\
  \ stay loose," {2} says, rolling {6} neck before approving a basic request.
STRETCHING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never stops moving. "You good, {0}?" "Yup, just\
  \ loosening up." Pop. Crack. {1}''s so used to stretching that {6} coworkers suspect {2}''d cramp up\
  \ instantly if {2} ever stopped.
STRETCHING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just stretch - {2} needs to. The stress, the\
  \ exhaustion, the pressure - {6} body takes it all in. So {2} moves, keeps things loose, because if\
  \ {6} joints lock up, {2} might realize just how much damage {2}''s actually taken.

SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.label=Suspicious Rituals
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Before every mission, {0} finds a quiet spot, kneels, and\
  \ draws something into the dirt. If no dirt is available, {2} scratches it into metal plating or\
  \ marks it with a grease pen. No one knows what the symbol means, and when asked, {2} just shrugs.\
  \ "Keeps me alive," {2} says. The {8} isn''t sure if {2}''s joking.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} spits exactly once outside the DropShip before entering\
  \ it, rubs the underside of {6} helmet before a firefight, and always, always makes a quick,\
  \ unreadable mark on {6} harness before booting up. No one has ever seen {4} forget one of these\
  \ rituals. And the one time someone tried to mess with them? The mission went horribly wrong.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t know where {2} picked up {6} habits, only that\
  \ they have to be done. Before every mission, {2} mutters phrases in a language that isn''t {6},\
  \ pockets a bullet casing from the last fight, and refuses to eat or drink in the last hour\
  \ before deployment. "What happens if you stop?" someone asks. {0} just stares at them for an\
  \ uncomfortably long time before replying, "We don''t want to find out."
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just sign off on jobs - {2} walks around {6}\
  \ workstation three times first, knocks on it in a very specific pattern, and occasionally sniffs\
  \ the air before nodding. "Standard procedure," {2} says. It''s not.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t do anything unless {2} first taps the console twice\
  \ with the back of {6} knuckles and places a single unspent round on top of it. {1} moves the\
  \ bullet only when the job is finished. "It''s for luck," {2} explains. "Whose?" someone asks. {1}\
  \ doesn''t answer.
SUPERSTITIOUS_RITUALS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} follows strict steps before finalizing reports - {2} burns a\
  \ single sheet of scrap paper, scratches a tally mark onto the corner of {6} desk, and whispers\
  \ something no one quite hears. {5} coworkers joke about it, but when someone skipped a step for\
  \ {4} once, a job went catastrophically wrong. {0} never raised {6} voice. {1} just  shook {6}\
  \ head and said, "Told you."

SUPERVISED_HABITS.label=Highly Supervised Habits
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never enters battle without running the exact same\
  \ pre-mission checks, always in full view of at least one superior officer. If no one''s watching?\
  \ {1} won''t start. "Regulations," {2} says when questioned. No one can find those regulations\
  \ anywhere, but that doesn''t stop {4}.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s gear logs, movement reports, and even meal schedules\
  \ are always reviewed by someone higher up. {1} pretends not to notice, but {2} does. If {2}\
  \ deviates even slightly from {6} routine, a quiet note appears in {6} file. {1} has no idea\
  \ why - but {2} makes sure to follow protocol exactly anyway.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to wonder why {2} had to log {6} every action. Why {2}\
  \ had to check in with command even for minor tasks. Why {6} reports were always cross-checked\
  \ against surveil{8} logs. But {2} stopped asking questions when {2} saw what happened to the\
  \ last guy who didn''t follow procedure.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s logs are double-checked, {6} reports personally\
  \ reviewed by command, and every one of {6} transactions requires approval. "It''s just standard\
  \ oversight," they tell {4}. "Sure," {2} mutters, stamping another form while {6} every action is\
  \ quietly noted.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just log {6} hours - {2} knows {6} workstation is\
  \ monitored, {6} comms are recorded, and {6} tasks are reported up the chain. If someone asks\
  \ why, {2} shrugs. "It''s just how things work around here." It wasn''t always like this.
SUPERVISED_HABITS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t step out of line, not even a little. The last time\
  \ {2} took one shortcut, {2} got called into a very quiet meeting. Nothing was said outright, but\
  \ {2} got the message. So now? Now {2} follows the rules exactly. Because if {2} slips up again,\
  \ {2}''s not sure if {2}''ll be allowed to come back.

TECH_TALK.label=Incessant Tech Talk
TECH_TALK.description.0.COMBATANT="{0}, is everything ready?" "Well, technically, the\
  \ tolerances are within acceptable limits, but I noticed a slight oscillation in the gyroscopic\
  \ feedback loop, so I recalibrated the - " "{0}, can you fight?" "...Yes."
TECH_TALK.description.1.COMBATANT="{0}, shoot that target!" "Hold on, I''m recalculating the\
  \ heat dispersion rate. If I fire now, the dissipation curve - " BOOM. Someone else takes the shot.\
  \ "Or we could just shoot it, {0}." {1} sighs. "Fine, but I had a better solution."
TECH_TALK.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just talk tech - {2} hides in it. Talk about\
  \ casualties? {1} pivots to weapon diagnostics. Discuss a lost battle? {1} starts breaking down\
  \ armor slag statistics. The moment {2} stops analyzing specs and stats, the reality of war starts\
  \ creeping in.
TECH_TALK.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never simplifies. "It''s a simple fix, right?" someone\
  \ asks. "Well, that depends on your definition of ''simple.'' You see, the underlying mechanical\
  \ factors - " At some point, people stop listening and just wait for {4} to finish.
TECH_TALK.description.1.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just good at {6} job - {2} insists everyone understand\
  \ exactly why. Checking inventory? {1}''s explaining supply chain inefficiencies. Running a\
  \ diagnostic? You''re getting a lesson on system architecture. Adjusting equipment? Better settle\
  \ in for a thesis-level discussion on biometrics. "{0}, we just need it to work." "Yes, but\
  \ don''t you want to know why it works?"
TECH_TALK.description.2.SUPPORT=People die. Battles are lost. War is chaos. But numbers? Numbers\
  \ don''t lie. Systems work or they don''t. Data doesn''t betray you. {0} clings to {6} tech talk\
  \ not because {2} loves it - but because it''s predictable. Unlike everything else around {4}.

TECHNOPHOBIA.label=Phobia of Technology
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} targeting HUD off as often as possible, swears\
  \ by manual firing overrides, and refuses to rely on automated systems. "You trust that garbage?"\
  \ {2} scoffs as {6} {8} syncs their helmets to command relays. "That''s how you die - trusting some\
  \ piece of code over your own instincts."
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT="You think your helmet''s safe? Ha. Ever read about feedback\
  \ seizures? That ''Mek''''s auto-ejection system? Kills more people than it saves." {0} distrusts\
  \ every technological convenience, always assuming something is about to go catastrophically\
  \ wrong. The terrifying thing? {1}''s not always wrong.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just distrust technology - {2} despises it. {1}''s\
  \ seen MekWarriors suffocate from malfunctioning life support systems, watched targeting\
  \ software glitch and send friendly fire downrange. People think war kills soldiers. {0} knows\
  \ the truth: technology is just waiting to finish the job.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to rely on digital records, still handwrites\
  \ reports, and triple-checks every automated system by hand. "What happens when the system\
  \ crashes?" {2} asks, tapping {6} paper records. "I''ll still know where everything is. Will you?"
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hates technology. "You think this reactor is stable?\
  \ Please. The second one capacitor misaligns, boom - you''re space debris." {1}''s the best at {6}\
  \ job, but {2}''s also convinced everything remotely high tech is secretly trying to kill everyone.
TECHNOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t fear technology because {2} doesn''t understand\
  \ it - {2} fears it because {2} understands it too well. {1}''s seen what happens when an IFF\
  \ controlled turret malfunctions, when a faulty suit seal dooms a pilot to vacuum, when a simple\
  \ software patch bricks a JumpShip''s entire navigation. Technology doesn''t fail quietly. It fails\
  \ with screams.

THESAURUS.label=Uses Obscure Words
THESAURUS.description.0.COMBATANT="We should establish a more oblique approach vector; otherwise,\
  \ we''ll be in a tactically unenviable position." {0}''s {8} stares. "{0}. Just say go\
  \ left." {1} sighs. "Fine. Go left."
THESAURUS.description.1.COMBATANT="Deploy to the interstitial zone before the enemy enacts an\
  \ envelopment maneuver." "{0}, what?" "Move to the alley before they surround us!" {5} {8}\
  \ has learned that when {0} starts using big words, they need to move fast - even if they don''t\
  \ fully understand why.
THESAURUS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} refuses to let war reduce {4} to grunts and curses. {1}\
  \ speaks in layered, precise language because it reminds {4} that {2}''s still human. That {2}''s\
  \ still thinking. Because the moment {2} starts speaking like the others - like a killer - {2} knows\
  \ there''s nothing left to save.
THESAURUS.description.0.SUPPORT="{0}, do we have any spare mark-3s?" "Ah, you seek\
  \ thermoregulatory mitigation apparatuses? Let me peruse the inventory compendium." "...So, is that\
  \ a yes?" "Indubitably."
THESAURUS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just do {6} job - {2} narrates it with unnecessarily\
  \ complicated words. "The logistical stratification of these assets necessitates a nuanced\
  \ redistribution methodology." "{0}, just say we need to move some crates." "But that lacks\
  \ precision."
THESAURUS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t say "task failed." {1} says "the structural\
  \ integrity of the asset has reached an unrecoverable threshold." {1} doesn''t say "the unit is\
  \ dead." {1} says "we have experienced an irreversible personnel attrition event." If {2} speaks\
  \ clinically enough, maybe the horror won''t feel real.

THIRD_PERSON.label=Speaks in Third Person
THIRD_PERSON.description.0.COMBATANT="{0} doesn''t like this. {0} thinks this is a bad plan." {5}\
  \ {8} groans. "{0}, you are {0}." {1} shrugs. "{0}''s aware of that. {0} still thinks you\

THIRD_PERSON.description.1.COMBATANT="{0} is moving to cover now. {0} is reloading. {0} would\
  \ appreciate it if someone covered {0} while {0} does this." {5} {8} has learned that if\

THIRD_PERSON.description.2.COMBATANT={0} speaks about {4}self like {2}''s not really there. Like\
  \ {2}''s just watching a story play out where {0} fights, {0} kills, {0} survives while\

THIRD_PERSON.description.0.SUPPORT="{0} appreciates your patience. {0} is considering your\

TIME_MANAGEMENT.label=Obsessed with Time Management
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just plan missions - {2} schedules them down to the\
  \ second. "If we''re not moving in ten seconds, we''re already behind." {5} {8} groans, but when\
  \ {6} precision means the difference between making an ambush or falling into one, they stop\
  \ arguing.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} counts everything. The seconds between artillery strikes,\
  \ the delay in enemy response times, the precise moment to duck before an incoming shot. {5}\
  \ {8} used to think it was a weird habit - until they realized {2} never mistimes a move.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just track time - {2} dreads it. Every mission is\
  \ another countdown, every day is another mark closer to an inevitable, unspoken deadline. {1}\
  \ schedules things not because {2} likes order, but because {2}''s terrified of how little control\
  \ anyone really has.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s personal planner is a masterpiece of\
  \ efficiency - color-coded, cross-referenced, down to the minute. "I''m ahead of schedule," {2}\
  \ mutters proudly, before immediately finding a new task to stay that way.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.1.SUPPORT="I have precisely four minutes for this discussion." "I planned\
  \ for this to take ten minutes, and now it''s taking eleven. I don''t not approve." {5} fixation\
  \ on deadlines is impressive, frustrating, and sometimes a little scary.
TIME_MANAGEMENT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just track time - {2} hoards it. Every lost minute\
  \ is another missed opportunity, another delay that could mean something worse later. {1} moves\
  \ fast, plans faster, because slowing down means acknowledging what time is really counting down\
  \ to.

TINKERER.label=Compulsive Tinkerer
TINKERER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s weapons, armor, and equipment are always in pieces,\
  \ even when there''s nothing wrong with them. {1} insists {2}''s "just improving performance," but\
  \ {6} {8} has caught {4} reassembling a perfectly functional radio just because something felt\
  \ off.
TINKERER.description.1.COMBATANT=Standard-issue gear? Not a chance. {0}''s sidearm has a\
  \ custom grip, {6} biometrics system runs on a personally adjusted algorithm, and no one quite\
  \ understands what {2} did to {6} HUD. {5} mods usually work - until they don''t.
TINKERER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} hands busy with wires, screws, and tools\
  \ because if {2} stops, {6} mind wanders. Machines are simple. Machines make sense. Unlike the\
  \ battlefield, unlike war, unlike the choices {2}''s made. If {2} can fix one more thing, maybe {2}\
  \ won''t feel how much {2}''s already lost.
TINKERER.description.0.SUPPORT=Even if something is running perfectly, {0} is convinced it\
  \ can be better. {1} reconfigures systems, fine-tunes settings, and makes adjustments that most\
  \ people never notice - but {2} does. And it bothers {4} if {2} doesn''t tweak it.
TINKERER.description.1.SUPPORT=If something has moving parts, {0} will take it apart. Pens,\
  \ terminals, doors - if it''s in front of {4} long enough, {2}''ll be "just checking something" and\
  \ then suddenly it''s in pieces. Most of the time, {2} puts things back better. Most of the time.
TINKERER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} fixes what''s in front of {4} - tools, systems, useless\
  \ little things - because it''s easier than fixing what''s actually wrong. The broken supply chain.\
  \ The dwindling resources. The names disappearing from the roster. If {2} focuses on tweaking\
  \ small things, maybe {2} won''t have to face the fact that some things can''t be fixed.

TRUTH_TELLER.label=Habitual Truth-Teller
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in false hope. "This is a bad plan," {2}\
  \ says, loading {6} harness. "We''re outgunned, outnumbered, and command doesn''t care if we come\
  \ back." {5} {8} groans, but deep down, they know {2}''s right. {1} always is.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t lie, even when {2} probably should. "You''re a\
  \ terrible shot," {2} tells a rookie after a botched drill. "That flank will collapse in three\
  \ minutes if we don''t move now," {2} warns the commander. No one ever likes what {2} has to say - but\
  \ ignoring {4} tends to get people killed.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what happens when people believe comfortable\
  \ lies. The ''easy mission'' that turned into a massacre. The ''reinforcements coming'' that never\
  \ arrived. {1} refuses to be part of it. If the truth is ugly, then people need to face it.\
  \ Anything else is just setting up another grave to be filled.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.0.SUPPORT="This system is failing," {0} states flatly. "The numbers\
  \ don''t add up. The schedule won''t hold. That plan won''t work." People hate bringing problems to\
  \ {0}, not because {2}''s wrong, but because {2} never softens the blow.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t deal in ''maybes'' or ''it should be fines.'' {1} wants\
  \ facts. If something is a disaster waiting to happen, {2}''ll say so. If someone asks for {6}\
  \ opinion, they''d better be ready for it. "You want my honest answer? Or the one that won''t hurt\
  \ your feelings?" {2} asks. Either way, they know which one they''re getting.
TRUTH_TELLER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t soften words because too many people have died\
  \ believing the wrong ones. False optimism has cost lives. Misleading reports have led to\
  \ disasters. If the truth is brutal, then so be it. At least with the truth, people have a chance\
  \ to prepare for what''s coming.

UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.label=Unnecessary Caution
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.0.COMBATANT={0} double-checks every safety, scans for traps in places no\
  \ one would bother setting them, and insists on running four different contingency plans before\
  \ stepping onto the DropShip. "{0}, it''s a milk run," someone says. "That''s what they said\
  \ last time," {2} mutters, adjusting {6} harness again.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.1.COMBATANT={0} clears every building like it''s booby-trapped, refuses to\
  \ fire unless {2}''s sure it''s a clean shot, and won''t step forward unless {2}''s positive about\
  \ footing. "We don''t have time for this," someone groans. "We don''t have time to die stupidly,\
  \ either," {0} shoots back.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just cautious - {2}''s haunted. {1} remembers the\
  \ comrade who didn''t check their six, the officer who rushed in, the mission that went bad\
  \ because someone thought they had more time. If {2} slows things down, if {2} takes one extra\
  \ moment, maybe {2} can stop the next name from being added to the list.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.0.SUPPORT="Are you sure that''s right? Let me check again. Just in case."\
  \ {0} verifies numbers three times, hesitates before confirming decisions, and won''t finalize\
  \ anything unless {2}''s completely convinced there''s no possible risk. It makes things painfully\
  \ slow, but {2}''s never wrong.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t sign off on something unless {2}''s checked every\
  \ possible issue, accounted for every variable, and personally confirmed the results. "Just say\
  \ yes, {0}," someone pleads. "Not until I''m sure," {2} replies, reading over the numbers one\
  \ more time.
UNNECESSARY_CAUTION.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s paranoia isn''t about efficiency - it''s about survival.\
  \ {1}''s seen how fast things spiral when someone gets lazy. A rushed approval. A miscalculated\
  \ order. A misfiled name on a casualty report. {1} checks and rechecks because one mistake can''t\
  \ be undone.

UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.label=Unpredictable Speech
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0.COMBATANT=One moment, {0} is delivering a perfectly detailed\
  \ battlefield analysis, and the next, {2}''s yelling "Engage the left flank! And also, did you\
  \ know horses used to be deployed in early mechanized warfare? Weird, right?" {5} {8} has no\
  \ idea how {6} brain works, but {6} plans usually make sense - eventually.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.1.COMBATANT="Okay, so imagine the enemy is a pack of hungry dogs, and we''re\
  \ holding a steak just out of reach - no, wait, bad example, let''s say they''re a bunch of perfectly\
  \ spherical cows - " "{0}, just tell us the plan." "I am!"
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s words jump between cold, clinical detachment and\
  \ erratic, almost manic tangents. One second, {2}''s reciting enemy force composition like a\
  \ machine, and the next, {2}''s muttering "Bad luck always comes in threes. It''s always threes."\
  \ {5} {8} pretends not to notice.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.0.SUPPORT={0} starts a sentence with "Per my previous assessment, we can\
  \ reasonably expect - " then immediately switches to " - okay, but also, we''re totally boned if this\
  \ goes sideways." No one ever knows what version of {0} they''re getting.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.1.SUPPORT={0} starts answering a simple question and ends up talking\
  \ about something completely different. "Yes, I have the report. But first, have you ever\
  \ considered how jump travel affects circadian rhythms? Because I was thinking - " At some point,\
  \ {6} coworkers just nod and hope {2} circles back.
UNPREDICTABLE_SPEECH.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s words don''t always line up with {6} thoughts. Sometimes\
  \ {2}''s too precise, other times {6} speech spirals into disconnected, looping statements. {1}\
  \ catches {4}self repeating things under {6} breath - things that don''t make sense anymore. And\
  \ when people ask if {2}''s okay, {2} just laughs and says "Define okay."

UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.label=Unusual Hobbies
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} spends downtime in ways that don''t quite make sense. {1}\
  \ maps out old battlefields for fun, builds intricate miniature cities out of plastic building\
  \ blocks, or memorizes entire books on obsolete military doctrine. No one understands why - and {2}\
  \ refuses to explain.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} can perfectly imitate bird calls. {1}''s fluent in ancient\
  \ dialects no one uses anymore. {1} collects weather patterns from different planets and can\
  \ predict storms better than an actual forecast. {5} {8} laughs - until one of {6} odd skills\
  \ actually saves their lives.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} carves intricate symbols into {6} armor, spends hours\
  \ arranging small stones in precise geometric patterns, or obsessively folds paper into strange\
  \ shapes. When asked, {2} just shrugs. "It keeps my hands busy." No one asks what happens if they\
  \ aren''t busy.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.0.SUPPORT=No one knows how {0} spends {6} off-hours. One day, {2}''s\
  \ learning obscure board games, the next, {2}''s trying to whistle in perfect harmonic resonance.\
  \ It''s never anything useful, but it''s always weirdly specific.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} goes through phases. One week, {2}''s obsessively\
  \ researching pre-spaceflight construction techniques. The next, {2}''s teaching {4}self to track\
  \ footsteps like an ancient hunter. {1} never sticks with anything for too long, but when {2}''s\
  \ interested in something, {2}''s all in.
UNUSUAL_HOBBIES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t learning these things because they''re fun. {1}''s\
  \ learning them because they keep {6} mind off everything else. It''s easier to master pointless\
  \ trivia, to hyper-focus on something no one cares about, than to dwell on the fact that {2}''s\
  \ watching everything around {4} slowly fall apart.

WATCH.label=Constantly Checking the Time
WATCH.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just check the time - {2} tracks it. {1} knows\
  \ exactly how long it''s been since deployment, how much time they have until extraction, and how\
  \ late support is running. "{0}, do you have to check your watch every five minutes?" "Yes. And\
  \ you should too."
WATCH.description.1.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} watch synced down to the millisecond. {1}\
  \ refuses to move before or after {6} planned schedule, times reloads perfectly, and somehow\
  \ always knows when trouble is about to start. "We''ve got ninety seconds before this goes to\
  \ hell," {2} mutters. {5} {8} laughs - until {2}''s exactly right.
WATCH.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t checking the time to stay on schedule - {2}''s counting\
  \ down. How long until the next battle. How long until reinforcements stop coming. How long until\
  \ the company finally collapses. {1} won''t say what {2}''s waiting for, but the way {2} stares at {6}\
  \ watch... it''s like {2} already knows.
WATCH.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just check the time - {2} lives by it. {1} watches the\
  \ clock constantly, measuring efficiency, tracking deadlines, and staring at people when they''re\
  \ even a second late. "You''re five minutes behind schedule," {2} announces. "{0}, stop doing\
  \ that."
WATCH.description.1.SUPPORT=Every task is timed. Every action is scheduled. {0} doesn''t\
  \ waste seconds - {2} counts them. {1} sighs when people work too slow, taps {6} fingers impatiently\
  \ when things aren''t moving fast enough, and always seems to be running out of time - even when no\
  \ one knows what for.
WATCH.description.2.SUPPORT={0} is always checking the time, but {2} never explains why. A\
  \ deadline? A warning? A moment {2}''s dreading? No one asks, because the way {2} looks at {6}\
  \ watch - like {2}''s counting down to something only {2} understands - is unsettling enough.

WEATHERMAN.label=Obsessed with Weather
WEATHERMAN.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just check the forecast - {2} studies it. {1} can\
  \ predict how wind speeds affect projectile trajectories, how moisture messes with sensor\
  \ readouts, how cloud cover changes visibility. {5} {8} used to ignore {4} - until {2} started\
  \ being right.
WEATHERMAN.description.1.COMBATANT="Storm''s rolling in. Humidity''s up - expect some weapon misfires.\
  \ Barometric pressure''s dropping, which means - " "{0}, can we focus?" {1} nods but still mutters,\
  \ "Gonna be a cold front in two hours." No one knows why it matters - but {2} keeps bringing it up\
  \ anyway.
WEATHERMAN.description.2.COMBATANT={0} can''t control the war. {1} can''t control death, orders, or\
  \ who makes it home. But {2} can control {6} understanding of the sky. {1} checks barometers,\
  \ watches wind speeds, tracks pressure shifts - because if nothing else, at least {2} knows when the\
  \ rain is coming.
WEATHERMAN.description.0.SUPPORT={0} always has local weather reports, even if {2}''s nowhere\
  \ near the planet''s surface. "Cloud cover''s thick today." "Wind speeds are up." "Did you know\
  \ this planet has a monsoon season?" No one knows why {2}''s tracking it - but {2} never stops.
WEATHERMAN.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t just answer a question - {2}''ll compare it to the\
  \ weather. "This delay is like a stalled pressure system - frustrating and going nowhere." "Supply\
  \ chains are like jet streams - unpredictable and constantly shifting." {1} acts like everything\
  \ ties back to the atmosphere.
WEATHERMAN.description.2.SUPPORT={0} notices when storms form earlier than expected. When the\
  \ wind blows the wrong way. When the rain doesn''t come when it should. {1} doesn''t just track the\
  \ weather - {2} reads it, like it''s warning {4} of something no one else can see.

WHISTLER.label=Frequent Whistler
WHISTLER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} whistles while mounting the DropShip, while advancing\
  \ through enemy fire, while standing over the wreckage of a downed opponent. It''s never\
  \ frantic - always slow, steady, calm. {5} {8} isn''t sure if it''s confidence or insanity, but\
  \ when the whistling stops, they know things have gone very wrong.
WHISTLER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has a tune for everything. A jaunty whistle during prep,\
  \ a lazy, off-key melody during downtime, and a slow, eerie note when things get tense. No one\
  \ knows where {2} picks {6} tunes from, but they always seem uncomfortably fitting for the moment.
WHISTLER.description.2.COMBATANT=The battlefield is loud, but the moments between the noise are\
  \ worse. {0} whistles to fill the void, to drown out the memories of screams and static-filled\
  \ last words. It''s not about the tune - it''s about making sure there''s always something to listen\
  \ to.
WHISTLER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} whistles while walking, while working, while thinking.\
  \ It''s never obnoxious, but it''s constant. When people ask {4} to stop, {2} just grins and says,\
  \ "Didn''t even realize I was doing it."
WHISTLER.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s whistling is weirdly predictable. Same tune every\
  \ morning. Same three notes while deep in thought. The exact same melody when something is about\
  \ to go wrong. No one knows if it''s a habit or if {2} knows something they don''t.
WHISTLER.description.2.SUPPORT=The world is full of noise - orders, gunfire, comms chatter, dying\
  \ words. But {0}''s whistle? That belongs to {4}. It''s the one sound in the universe that isn''t\
  \ dictated by war, by loss, by duty. And if {2} ever stops... it means {2}''s finally lost that, too.

WORRIER.label=Persistent Worrier
WORRIER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just think something could go wrong - {2}''s sure of\
  \ it. "The comms will cut out. The terrain is unstable. The enemy definitely has backup waiting."\

WORRIER.description.1.COMBATANT="What if the LZ is compromised? What if the intel is wrong?\
  \ What if we don''t have enough ammo?" {0}''s mind never stops calculating risks, even when\
  \ they''re already in the fight. {5} {8} tries to reassure {4}, but the way {2} keeps checking\
  \ {6} weapon makes it clear - {2}''s already expecting the worst.
WORRIER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t paranoid. {0} isn''t overthinking things. {0} is\
  \ remembering. The last time they rushed in. The last time someone ignored the warning signs. The\
  \ last time {2} didn''t worry enough, and it got people killed. {1} refuses to make that mistake\
  \ again.
WORRIER.description.0.SUPPORT="That system is overdue for maintenance." "We''re cutting it\
  \ close on time." "Has anyone accounted for contingencies?" {0} isn''t negative - {2}''s just\
  \ realistic. And when something does go wrong, the first thing people say is, "{0} called it."
WORRIER.description.1.SUPPORT=Even when everything seems fine, {0} worries. "We''re ahead of\
  \ schedule, but what if something delays us?" "We have the supplies, but what if demand\
  \ increases?" {5} coworkers try to calm {4} down, but {2} always has one more thing to stress\
  \ about.
WORRIER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just anxious - {2} knows something''s wrong. Resources\

BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.label=Constantly Reminiscing
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0.COMBATANT="This reminds me of a fight we had on Kelenfold. Same terrain,\

BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just remember past battles - {2} lives in them. {1}\

  \ close enough."
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} talks about old wars, old missions, old friends.\
  \ Sometimes it''s nostalgia. Sometimes it''s guilt. Sometimes it''s just because if {2} thinks too\
  \ hard about right now, about everything falling apart, {2} won''t be able to keep going.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what''s happening, {0} relates it to something that\
  \ came before. "This reminds me of the time we had to pull triple shifts because of a command\
  \ error." "We used to have a system for this - back when things actually worked." {1} doesn''t\
  \ complain - {2} just remembers.
BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just talk about what''s happening now - {2} always\

BATTLEFIELD_NOSTALGIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} clings to memories like they''re the last stable thing\
  \ left. The names, the places, the stories - they''re all still real as long as {2} keeps saying them\

  \ yanks a jammed sidearm free with enough force to nearly break the slide, wrenches a stuck panel\

HEAVY_HANDED.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t care if {2}''s hard on {6} gear. It''ll break. It\

  \ else to replace it. {1}''s seen too many things - and people - fall apart to pretend anything is\
  \ built to last.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t handle things - {2} manhandles them. {1} types hard\

  \ bolts to the point where no one else can loosen them again.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.1.SUPPORT=If something isn''t working, {0}''s first instinct is violence.\
  \ A firm smack, a hard shove, a sharp twist. "That''s not how you fix it," someone mutters. Then\
  \ the system boots up, the machine hums to life, or the issue just disappears. No one knows how\
  \ {2} does it, but it keeps happening.
HEAVY_HANDED.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t have time for delicate fixes or careful handling.\
  \ The system works, or it doesn''t. If it breaks, {2}''ll force it to work or move on to something\

RATION_HOARDER.label=Hoarding Rations

RATION_HOARDER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t waste a single calorie. Every meal is planned,\

RATION_HOARDER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just hoard rations - {2} protects them. {1}''s seen\

RATION_HOARDER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} always has extra. A drawer full of protein bars, a private\

  \ something.
RATION_HOARDER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} eats strategically. {1} stretches rations, saves portions\
  \ for later, and never assumes there''ll be another meal. {1}''s not stingy - {2} just knows better\
  \ than to believe in a steady supply of anything.
RATION_HOARDER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} hoards food because {2}''s seen what happens when people\
  \ don''t have enough. The fear, the desperation, the way alliances shatter over a single meal.\
  \ {1}''d rather be prepared than be one of the ones begging.

EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.label=Obsessive Manual Reader

EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1.COMBATANT=If there''s a standard operating procedure, {0} follows it to\
  \ the letter. If there isn''t, {2} finds one. {1} once took a minute mid-firefight to check a repair\
  \ guide before rerouting {6} weapon''s coolant lines. {5} {8} swears {2} must be part-machine\
  \ with how efficiently {2} processes instructions.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2.COMBATANT=War is messy. Orders change. People die. But manuals? Manuals\
  \ are structured, predictable, reliable. {0} reads them obsessively because they offer\
  \ certainty - cold, clinical instructions that don''t lie, don''t panic, and don''t get killed when\
  \ things go wrong.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} won''t touch anything without consulting the exact\
  \ procedures. "Let''s just figure it out," someone suggests. "Or," {0} says, holding up a\
  \ heavily annotated guide, "we could follow the documented process and not break something."
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} keeps physical copies of manuals even when digital\
  \ versions are readily available. {1} has a personal archive of reference materials for\
  \ everything - even things {2} doesn''t personally work with. "You never know when you''ll need to\
  \ troubleshoot an emergency oxygen scrubber," {2} insists.
EMERGENCY_MANUAL_READER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} reads every procedure, every emergency guide, every\
  \ outdated manual because {2}''s seen what happens when people don''t know what to do. {1} memorizes\
  \ survival instructions not for if things go wrong - but for when they do.

QUICK_TO_QUIP.label=Quick to Make Jokes
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0.COMBATANT=Bullets are flying, alerts are blaring, and {0} is grinning.\
  \ "Well, this is suboptimal," {2} quips as an enemy round barely misses {4}. {5} {8} groans, but\
  \ they know - if {0}''s still joking, the fight isn''t completely lost yet.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never lets a situation stay too serious. "If we die, I\
  \ just want you all to know - I left my coffee machine on." {5} {8} doesn''t always appreciate the\
  \ timing, but sometimes, the right joke at the right time is just enough to break the tension.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2.COMBATANT={0} laughs because if {2} stops, {2} might have to actually\
  \ think about what''s happening. The losses, the suffering, the weight of everything - it''s too\
  \ much. So instead, {2} cracks another joke, forces another grin, and keeps moving like nothing''s\
  \ wrong.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what''s happening, {0} finds a way to comment on it.\
  \ "Oh, another system failure? I''m shocked. Truly." {5} coworkers groan, but when things get\
  \ stressful, {6} humor is sometimes the only thing keeping them from snapping.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.1.SUPPORT={0} knows when people are tense, and {6} first instinct is\
  \ always to break the tension with a joke. "Bad news: We''re out of supplies. Good news: Now we\
  \ have a valid excuse to take a really long lunch break." It''s impossible to stay completely\
  \ miserable around {4}.
QUICK_TO_QUIP.description.2.SUPPORT={0} makes jokes because if {2} stops, everything starts feeling\
  \ too real. {1} can''t fix the shortages, the losses, or the slow collapse of everything they''ve\
  \ built - but {2} can make people laugh, even if only for a moment. And sometimes, that''s the only\
  \ thing keeping them all from breaking.

TECH_SKEPTIC.label=Distrusts New Technology
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} hates new tech. If it''s not field-tested, battle-worn,\
  \ and proven reliable, {2} wants nothing to do with it. "They say this targeting system improves\
  \ accuracy by 14%," someone says. {0} scoffs. "And I say it''s gonna get you killed when it\
  \ glitches at the worst possible moment."
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1.COMBATANT="Assisted targeting? No thanks. I trust my own aim." {0}\
  \ refuses to rely on advanced systems, opting for manual overrides, old-school tactics, and tech\
  \ {2} can actually repair {4}self. {5} {8} mocks {6} stubbornness - until their fancy gear\
  \ inevitably malfunctions, and {0}''s old methods keep {4} alive.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just skeptical - {2}''s haunted by past failures. The\
  \ cutting-edge weapons that jammed, the prototype that failed, the experimental implants that\
  \ fried their users from the inside out. {1} doesn''t hate innovation - {2} just knows that in war,\
  \ new means untested, and untested means deadly.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.0.SUPPORT="Why upgrade something that isn''t broken?" {0} refuses to\
  \ switch to the newest software, insists on using old tools, and distrusts anything marketed as\
  \ "next-gen." If forced to adopt new tech, {2} still keeps the old version just in case.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t touch new systems until they''ve been through hell\
  \ and back. "They say this interface makes things ''more efficient.'' Yeah? Let''s see how\
  \ ''efficient'' it is when it inevitably crashes at the worst time." {1}''s always got a backup plan\
  \ because {2}''s always expecting failure.
TECH_SKEPTIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} remembers the computer-controlled security that\
  \ malfunctioned and started targeting friendlies. The automated supply chain that collapsed when\
  \ one bad update corrupted the entire system. The experimental life support module that wasn''t\
  \ tested enough. {1} doesn''t avoid new tech because {2}''s stubborn - {2} avoids it because {2} knows\
  \ better.

POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.label=Performs Post-Battle Rituals
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0.COMBATANT=Win or lose, {0} follows the exact same steps after every\
  \ engagement. {1} cleans {6} weapon the same way, checks {6} gear in the same order, and takes a\
  \ deep breath at the same moment in the process. "It''s about discipline," {2} insists. {5} {8}\
  \ suspects it''s about something else entirely.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} kneels, mutters a phrase in a language no one recognizes,\
  \ and presses {6} fingers against the barrel of {6} weapon for exactly five seconds. "What are\
  \ you doing?" someone finally asks. {1} shrugs. "Making sure we got through this one clean." They\
  \ don''t ask again.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t know when {2} started {6} post-battle rituals. {1}\
  \ just knows {2} has to do them. The moment {2} skips a step - doesn''t wipe down {6} helmet, doesn''t\
  \ trace the same pattern onto {6} gauntlet, doesn''t whisper whatever it is {2} whispers - is the\
  \ moment {2}''s afraid the war will finally swallow {4} whole.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.0.SUPPORT=After every engagement, {0} follows a precise series of\
  \ actions - even when they aren''t necessary. {1} organizes exactly the same way, rechecks records\
  \ twice, and won''t move on until {2}''s completed every part of {6} routine. If interrupted, {2}\
  \ starts over.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t talk about what happened in the last engagement\
  \ until {2}''s lit a small candle, wiped down {6} work surface, and written something in a battered\
  \ notebook. "It''s just habit," {2} says. But when someone asks what {2} writes, {2} simply closes\
  \ the book and walks away.
POST_BATTLE_RITUALS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t explain why {2} does it - why {2} marks down the names\
  \ of those who fought after every scenario, why {2} places a small object just so on {6} desk, why\
  \ {2} won''t leave the room until {2}''s recited a short phrase under {6} breath. {1} just knows that\
  \ stopping feels wrong. And in this war, when something feels wrong, it usually means something\
  \ bad is coming.

OVER_COMMUNICATOR.label=Over-Explains
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.0.COMBATANT="{0}, is your weapon jammed?" "Technically, it''s not a\
  \ jam - it''s a partial failure in the ejection mechanism caused by an accumulation of carbon\
  \ scoring, which, if we really want to get into it, is a byproduct of excessive thermal cycling - "\
  \ "{0}, is it jammed?" "...Yes."
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just call out enemy movements - {2} breaks them down\
  \ step by step. "They''re flanking left, which makes sense given their formation, but what they\
  \ don''t realize is that their advance pattern leaves a small gap in their center-left quadrant,\
  \ which - " "{0}, just shoot them."
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just explain - {2} over-explains everything, because\
  \ if {2} keeps talking, if {2} keeps analyzing, then {2} doesn''t have to think about the bigger\
  \ picture. The bodies. The losses. The inevitable end. If {2} stops, {2}''ll have to face it all at\
  \ once.
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter the question, {0}''s answer comes with a detailed,\
  \ multi-step breakdown. "{0}, can you confirm if the report was sent?" "Yes, and let me walk\
  \ you through the transmission process to ensure you fully understand how the routing system\
  \ prioritizes data packets - " "{0}, just say yes."
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never just answers - {2} educates. Even if no one asked. "Did\
  \ you know this entire system was originally designed for an entirely different purpose? Well,\
  \ let me explain - " It''s easier to let {4} finish than to try and stop {4}.
OVER_COMMUNICATOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows things are spiraling. The war, the company,\
  \ everything. But if {2} can explain things, if {2} can make sense of small details, then maybe {2}\
  \ can convince {4}self that some part of this universe still makes sense.

FIELD_MEDIC.label=Tends to Perform Medical Aid
FIELD_MEDIC.description.0.COMBATANT="You''re bleeding," {0} says flatly. "No, I''m not-" Before the\

  \ efficiency. {1}''s not officially a MedTech, but {6} {8} has learned that refusing {6} help is a\
  \ waste of time.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hesitate. Broken nose? Snap - reset. Gunshot wound?\
  \ Bandaged in seconds. {1}''s not delicate, but {2}''s effective. "You can complain about my bedside\
  \ manner after you stop leaking."
FIELD_MEDIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t a MedTech, but MedTechs don''t always arrive. {1}''s\
  \ seen too many soldiers bleed out because no one knew what to do. So {2} learned. And now,\
  \ whether it''s {6} job or not, {2}''ll make sure at least one more person makes it out alive.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter where {0} is, {2} always seems to have bandages,\
  \ antiseptic, or something to stop the bleeding. "How do you always have medical supplies?"\
  \ someone asks. {1} just shrugs. "People get hurt."
FIELD_MEDIC.description.1.SUPPORT=Someone''s got a nasty cut? {0}''s already disinfecting it. A\
  \ bad bruise? {1}''s handing over an ice pack. {1} never makes a big deal out of it, but no one''s\
  \ surprised when {2} turns up with the exact medical supply they need.
FIELD_MEDIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t hesitate to help because no one should have to\
  \ wait for care, not if {2} can do something about it. If {2} has to be the one to keep people\
  \ patched up, then so be it.

SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.label=Constantly Calibrates Systems
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in manufacturer presets. Before every\
  \ mission, {2} fine-tunes {6} weapon''s targeting sensors, adjusts {6} harness, and manually tweaks\
  \ {6} HUD display. "{0}, do you have to recalibrate before every fight?" "Unless you want bad\
  \ readings," {2} mutters, already adjusting the settings again.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never trusts that things are properly configured. {1}\
  \ double-checks everything even if nothing seems wrong. {5} {8} rolls their eyes when {2}\
  \ starts another adjustment... until the one time {2} actually catches a flaw before it gets someone\
  \ killed.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} can''t control when the enemy attacks, who makes it home,\
  \ or when command makes a terrible call. But {2} can control {6} calibrations. {1} can adjust the\
  \ tolerances, refine the readouts, tune {6} weapons. If everything is set just right, maybe - just\
  \ maybe - {2}''ll live through one more battle.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never leaves anything at default. If there''s a way to\
  \ fine-tune performance, {2}''ll find it. If a system feels even slightly off, {2}''s adjusting it\
  \ before anyone else even notices. "You changed the parameters again?" someone groans. "The old\
  \ settings were inefficient," {2} replies without looking up.
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just calibrate things - {2} obsesses over them. {1}\
  \ adjusts tolerances, shifts parameters, and tweaks systems down to decimal-point precision.\
  \ "{0}, it was working fine." "Yeah," {2} says, still adjusting. "But it could be better."
SYSTEM_CALIBRATOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} calibrates because {2} has to. {1}''s seen what happens when\
  \ a system is just a fraction out of sync. If {2} can stop even one of those failures, {2}''ll keep\
  \ adjusting and maybe {6} hands will stop shaking.

AMMO_COUNTER.label=Obsessive Counter
AMMO_COUNTER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fire {6} weapon - {2} tracks every single shot.\
  \ "Nine left. Two more reloads. Twenty-three hostiles still moving." {5} {8} doesn''t always\
  \ appreciate the running tally, but when ammo runs low, {0}''s the only one who actually knows\
  \ how much is left.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} counts enemy movements, tracks their steps, and notes the\
  \ exact delay between artillery salvos. "That cannon fires every 16.4 seconds," {2} mutters. "We\
  \ have 3.2 seconds to move." Someone scoffs - until {0} steps out exactly on time, avoiding the\
  \ blast.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t count for fun. {1} counts because it''s the only\
  \ thing keeping {4} grounded. {1} tracks shots, seconds, distances - anything but the number of\
  \ bodies left behind. The moment {2} stops counting, {2} knows {2}''ll have to face those numbers\
  \ too.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} counts steps, counts supplies, counts the seconds between\
  \ each transmission ping. If something isn''t accounted for, it bothers {4}. "How many crates were\
  \ moved?" "Forty-six." "You didn''t even check." "I know." And {2}''s always right.
AMMO_COUNTER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} tracks everything from the number of times someone taps\
  \ their pen to how many times a door opens in a shift. No one knows why {2} does it, and even {2}\
  \ isn''t sure anymore. "How many times has that console flickered today?" "Seventeen." "...{0},\
  \ why?" "Why not?"
AMMO_COUNTER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop counting. The seconds between system checks,\
  \ the steps between buildings, the number of people who were here yesterday but aren''t today. {1}\
  \ doesn''t know what will happen when {2} loses count, but something deep inside tells {4} {2} never\
  \ wants to find out.

BRAVADO.label=Excessive Bravado
BRAVADO.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never enters a fight quietly. "Two {8}s of heavy\
  \ ''Mek? Easy. They should''ve sent more if they wanted a challenge." {1} grins like {2}''s\
  \ completely unfazed, even when {2} definitely should be concerned. The problem? Sometimes {2}''s\
  \ actually good enough to pull it off.
BRAVADO.description.1.COMBATANT="This is fine," {0} says, standing in the open as artillery\
  \ shells rain down. "I''ve seen worse." {1} hasn''t. {1} definitely hasn''t. But {2}''ll keep up the act\
  \ until either the battle ends or someone physically drags {4} to cover.
BRAVADO.description.2.COMBATANT={0} talks big because if {2} doesn''t, someone else will break\
  \ first. {1} boasts, {2} laughs, {2} grins like {2}''s invincible - because if {2} stops, if {2} admits\
  \ how bad things really are, the weight of it all might finally crush {4}.
BRAVADO.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just fix problems - {2} makes it sound like {2}''s\
  \ pulling off miracles. "You need this report done? Lucky for you, I''m the best there is." "Oh, a\
  \ system malfunction? Give me five minutes and witness greatness."
BRAVADO.description.1.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just confident - {2} acts like {2}''s single-handedly\
  \ holding the entire operation together. "Without me? This whole thing would fall apart." It''s\
  \ unclear if {2} actually believes it, but {2} says it so often, others start to wonder if {2}''s\
  \ right.
BRAVADO.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has to act like everything is under control, like {2}''s too\
  \ good to fail. Because if {2} lets even one crack show, if {2} even acknowledges how dire things\
  \ are, the whole illusion shatters. So {2} smirks, flexes, and keeps acting like the universe\
  \ hasn''t already stacked the deck against {4}.

COMBAT_SONG.label=Sings During Engagements
COMBAT_SONG.description.0.COMBATANT={0} belts out a tune the moment the shooting starts.\
  \ Sometimes it''s a classic war ballad, sometimes it''s an old drinking song, and sometimes it''s\
  \ just wordless humming. It''s both comforting and deeply unsettling - especially when {6} voice\
  \ stays perfectly steady even under heavy fire.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1.COMBATANT=Bullets fly, explosions shake the ground, and {0}? {0}''s\
  \ singing. "{0}, why the hell are you singing right now?" someone shouts. "Gotta keep morale\
  \ up!" {2} yells back - right before nailing a perfect headshot while still holding a tune.
COMBAT_SONG.description.2.COMBATANT={0} sings because it drowns everything else out. The screams,\
  \ the comm chatter, the sound of {6} own heartbeat pounding in {6} skull. If {2} stops singing,\
  \ that means the battle''s over - and that means {2} has to face whatever''s left behind.
COMBAT_SONG.description.0.SUPPORT=While alarms blare and chaos erupts, {0} is whistling a tune\
  \ and getting to work. The DropShip might be on fire, the systems might be failing, but that\
  \ won''t stop {4} from casually humming an old folk song as {2} works.
COMBAT_SONG.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s voice is steady, unfazed, even when things go sideways.\
  \ {1} sings because it helps, because someone has to act like everything''s still under control.\
  \ "If {0}''s still singing," someone mutters, "then maybe we''re not totally screwed yet."
COMBAT_SONG.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t even realize when {2} starts singing. {5} hands\
  \ move on autopilot, {6} voice carries through the chaos, and for a moment, it''s like nothing''s\
  \ wrong. If {2} keeps singing, {2} doesn''t have to think about the names missing from the roster\
  \ after this is over.

COMMS_TOGGLE.label=Constantly Toggles Comms Channels
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} cycles through comms channels like {2}''s flipping through\
  \ music stations. {7} chatter, command directives, even open frequencies - if anyone is talking,\
  \ {2}''s listening. "{0}, stay on our channel!" "I am - mostly."
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has to hear what''s going on. Friendly {8}s, enemy\
  \ signals, background noise - {2} constantly switches between them. "Gotta stay informed," {2} says.\
  \ {5} {8} jokes that {2} probably knows the enemy''s dinner plans before they do.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps flipping channels because silence means something\
  \ has gone wrong. Someone''s down. A signal''s lost. A {8} isn''t reporting back. {1}''s seen too\
  \ many comms go quiet forever - so {2} never stops listening, because the moment {2} does, {2} might\
  \ miss someone''s last words.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} listens to every comms feed. Logistics, operations,\
  \ emergency reports - {2} jumps between them so fast it''s a wonder {2} actually understands what''s\
  \ going on. Somehow, though, {2} always seems to catch the most important detail just in time.
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t eavesdrop - {2} just happens to hear everything. One\
  \ second {2}''s tuned into maintenance chatter, the next {2}''s listening to high-level command\
  \ discussions. "You''re not supposed to be on that channel, {0}." "Then why is it so easy to\
  \ access?"
COMMS_TOGGLE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} listens like {2}''s expecting something. Some warning. Some\
  \ disaster. Some signal that no one else is paying attention to. And when someone asks why {2}''s\
  \ so obsessed with monitoring channels, {2} just mutters, "Because I don''t want to hear nothing."

EJECTION_READY.label=Paranoid About Emergency Systems
EJECTION_READY.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in safety assurances. If something is\
  \ meant to activate in a crisis, {2} assumes it won''t. {1} constantly checks, double-checks, and\
  \ personally verifies every precaution, because if something can fail, it will.
EJECTION_READY.description.1.COMBATANT="You trust that system? That''s cute." {0} always has a backup\
  \ plan, an alternative escape route, or a manual override ready to go. {1} assumes any warning\
  \ system is too slow, any failsafe is flawed, and that if {2} doesn''t prepare {4}self, no one else\
  \ will.
EJECTION_READY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen protections fail, safeguards ignored, and too\
  \ many people put their faith in something that was never properly tested. {1} doesn''t trust\
  \ emergency measures - not because {2}''s paranoid, but because in {6} experience, they only work\
  \ when you don''t actually need them.
EJECTION_READY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just check emergency protocols - {2} lives by them.\
  \ If something is supposed to work in a crisis, {2} personally verifies it. If people aren''t\
  \ following procedure, {2} makes sure they do. Others think {2}''s overreacting - until something\
  \ actually goes wrong.
EJECTION_READY.description.1.SUPPORT="You really believe that alarm will go off when it''s supposed\
  \ to? That''s... optimistic." {0} treats every emergency system as already broken until proven\
  \ otherwise. If something hasn''t failed yet, it''s because it hasn''t had the chance to.
EJECTION_READY.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen what happens when maintenance gets lazy, when\
  \ procedures are skipped, when the wrong people sign off on safety reports. {1} doesn''t assume\
  \ an emergency system will work - {2} assumes it won''t. And when it doesn''t, {2} won''t be the one\
  \ caught off guard.

HAND_SIGNS.label=Uses Elaborate Hand Signals
HAND_SIGNS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just use standard gestures - {2}''s got a whole extra\
  \ layer of silent communication. {1} signals things that don''t need signals, and half the time,\
  \ {6} {8} isn''t even sure what {2}''s trying to say. The weird part? {1} seems to think everyone\
  \ should already know.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} gives entire tactical briefings with just {6} hands, even\
  \ when talking would be faster. {1} insists it''s more efficient - except when it isn''t. {5} gestures\
  \ get more exaggerated the more frustrated {2} is, until it looks like {2}''s orchestrating a silent\
  \ electro-opera.
HAND_SIGNS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just use hand signals as a preference - {2} relies\
  \ on them. {1}''s seen how noise gives away positions, how a whispered word at the wrong time can\
  \ be the last thing someone says. {1} signals because it''s safer. Because sometimes, speaking at\
  \ all is too dangerous.
HAND_SIGNS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just talk - {2} narrates with {6} hands. Simple\
  \ explanations become full-body performances, and anyone talking to {4} has to watch as much as\
  \ listen. "Are the signals necessary?" someone asks. "They enhance communication," {0} insists,\
  \ while pointing dramatically.
HAND_SIGNS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} insists {6} elaborate gestures are perfectly clear. They\
  \ are not. {1}''s constantly flashing signals that only {2} understands, expecting others to follow\
  \ along. "What does this mean?" someone asks, mimicking {6} motions. "That''s obvious," {0}\
  \ scoffs. "It means ''consider alternatives.''"
HAND_SIGNS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen conversations get overheard, plans fall apart\
  \ because someone was listening when they shouldn''t have been. {1} signals because it''s safer.\
  \ Because habits save lives. And because sometimes, talking out loud means giving away too much\
  \ to the wrong person.

HATE_FOR_MEKS.label=Harbors a Deep Hatred for ''Mek
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0.COMBATANT="You really think a giant walking target is the best way to\

  \ everyone that half of history''s worst battles were fought with people betting their lives on\
  \ unreliable metal coffins.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just dislike Mek - {2} resents them. The\

  \ instead of who actually has skill. "People used to fight with their own hands," {2} mutters.\
  \ "Now they just let a fusion engine do the killing for them."
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s hatred for Mek isn''t abstract. {1}''s been on the wrong\

  \ flash of energy fire. {1} doesn''t fear Mek - {2} despises them.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has an opinion, and {2}''ll never stop sharing it. "Mek\

  \ about why they shouldn''t.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.1.SUPPORT=If something goes wrong, {0} finds a way to blame it on Mek.\
  \ Supplies running low? "Because of ''Mek maintenance costs." Damage to infrastructure? "Because\

  \ thinks they''re all just walking catastrophes waiting to happen.
HATE_FOR_MEKS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just dislike Mek - {2}''s seen what they leave\
  \ behind. {1}''s seen men and women turned to slurry by ''Mek-scale machine guns, counted the losses\

  \ {1} knows Mek win wars. {1} also knows the damage they cause.

IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.label=Uses Improvised Weaponry
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just rely on standard-issue arms - {2} sees weapons\
  \ everywhere. A loose piece of metal? A makeshift club. A handful of debris? A distraction tool.\
  \ "A gun''s nice," {2} says, "but creativity keeps you alive."
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t wait for the perfect tool - {2} adapts. A broken\
  \ piece of equipment? A blunt weapon. A stray cable? A garrote. {5} {8} has seen {4} turn\
  \ debris into effective tools of survival more times than they can count. "You fight with what\
  \ you have," {2} says, "not what you wish you had."
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust ammunition supplies, doesn''t expect\
  \ reinforcements, doesn''t assume {2}''ll have what {2} needs when {2} needs it. {1}''s seen fights last\
  \ longer than the weapons meant to win them. So {2}''s learned to make anything deadly - because {2}\
  \ refuses to be the one left empty-handed.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has a habit of repurposing things. That wrench? A club.\
  \ That office chair? A barricade. {1} doesn''t go looking for fights, but if one happens, {2}''ll\
  \ immediately size up {6} surroundings for what can be used in a pinch.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t assume safety. If things go bad, {2}''s already\
  \ figured out how to use the tools around {4} as weapons. {1}''s got a solid grip on that\
  \ clipboard for a reason. And if {2}''s holding a heavy-duty stapler? That''s not an accident.
IMPROVISED_WEAPONRY.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust in things being available when needed. {1}''s\
  \ seen people die reaching for weapons that weren''t there. So {2} treats everything like it might\
  \ be the only thing standing between {4} and the worst-case scenario. And if that means turning\
  \ a screwdriver into a weapon, so be it.

PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.label=Believes in Omens
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just prepare for battle - {2} reads the battlefield\
  \ before it even starts. A bird flying against the wind? Bad sign. A weapon jam during pre-check?\
  \ Worse. If something feels off, {2} adjusts {6} approach immediately. Others call it paranoia,\
  \ but {0} swears it''s saved {6} life before.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has walked away from engagements because the omens were\
  \ wrong. If the sun rises through heavy fog, if the wind shifts in a way that feels unnatural, if\
  \ {2} dreams of something {2}''d rather forget - {2}''ll find a way to stall, adjust, or avoid the fight\
  \ entirely. People call {4} superstitious. {1} calls them reckless.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in luck, but {2} believes in warnings.\
  \ {1}''s watched people ignore the signs - only for them to never return. A slight misstep, a broken\
  \ routine, a bird call at the wrong time - all dismissed, all followed by disaster. {1}''s done\
  \ trying to convince others. {1} just hopes {2}''s smart enough to listen when it matters.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} hesitates before making decisions if something feels\
  \ wrong. Maybe it''s a strange silence, maybe it''s a bad dream, maybe it''s just a gut feeling. But\
  \ if an omen tells {4} not to do something, {2} won''t, and {2} doesn''t care how irrational it seems.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t need dramatic omens - {2} picks up on subtle ones. A\
  \ light flickering? A bad sign. A sudden chill in the air? Something''s coming. {1} doesn''t always\
  \ say what {2} expects to happen, but the way {2} reacts makes it clear - {2} believes something will.
PRE_BATTLE_SUPERSTITIONS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows the universe is cruel, that fate doesn''t care. But\
  \ omens? Omens give order to the chaos. They tell {4} when to act, when to wait, when to prepare\
  \ for the worst. Because if {2} ever stops believing in the signs, {2}''ll have to accept that\
  \ nothing is watching out for them at all.

SILENT_LEADER.label=Silent Leader
SILENT_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t give speeches. {1} doesn''t bark orders. {1} moves,\
  \ and people follow. {1} sees what needs to be done, takes the first step, and - without ever saying\
  \ a word - {6} {8} finds themselves falling in line behind {4}.
SILENT_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t need to shout to be heard. A g{8}, a nod, a\
  \ subtle motion of {6} hand - it''s all the direction {6} team needs. {1} rarely explains {4}self,\
  \ but when {2} moves with purpose, people trust {4} enough to follow without question.
SILENT_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen too many commanders make grand speeches, give\
  \ bold promises - only to watch them die meaningless deaths. {1} doesn''t inspire with words. {1}\
  \ inspires by surviving, by acting, by doing what has to be done without the need for\
  \ reassurance. Those who follow {4} don''t do it because {2} tells them to. They do it because {2}\
  \ keeps them alive.
SILENT_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t waste time on debates or power struggles. When\
  \ something needs to be fixed, organized, or handled, {2} just does it. And soon enough, the\
  \ people around {4} realize they''re following {6} lead without even thinking about it.
SILENT_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never asks for recognition, never tries to take control.\
  \ But somehow, {6} way of doing things always becomes the way things get done. People look to {4}\
  \ when they''re uncertain, even though {2} never volunteers for leadership.
SILENT_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t lead because {2} wants to. {1} leads because someone\
  \ has to. {1}''s seen what happens when no one steps up, when people hesitate, when leadership\
  \ fails. {1} speaks when necessary, but most of the time, {2} just acts. And those who survive\
  \ understand why that''s enough.

BATTLE_CRITIC.label=Constant Critic
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.0.COMBATANT=No strategy is ever good enough for {0}. {1} picks apart every\
  \ formation, every maneuver, every decision. "That''s a weak flank. That exit is a death trap.\
  \ This timing is off by at least three seconds." It''s exhausting - but more than once, {6}\
  \ nitpicking has saved lives.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t care about sparing feelings - {2} cares about\
  \ survival. If someone makes a bad call, {2}''ll say it outright. If a plan is sloppy, {2}''ll tear\
  \ it apart in real-time. "That was a terrible angle. You barely made that shot." {5} {8}\
  \ complains - until they realize {2}''s making them better.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust victories. {1}''s seen how overconfidence\
  \ gets people killed, how one unchecked mistake can doom an entire {8}. So {2} criticizes\
  \ everything, no matter how small. Because if people stop improving, they stop surviving.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.0.SUPPORT=No system, no process, no decision is above {0}''s scrutiny.\
  \ "This could be more efficient. That''s a terrible use of resources. Who approved this mess?"\
  \ {1}''s relentless - but frustratingly, {2}''s also usually right.
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t let anything slide. {1}''ll call out redundancies,\
  \ inefficiencies, and anything that isn''t perfectly optimized. "Oh, we''re doing it this way? Bold\
  \ choice. Hope you like fixing it later."
BATTLE_CRITIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t criticize to be difficult - {2} criticizes because {2}\
  \ knows what happens when details get overlooked. The smallest oversight can spiral into\
  \ catastrophe. If {2}''s harsh, if {2}''s relentless, it''s because {2}''s seen how easily things fall\
  \ apart when people stop paying attention.

CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.label=Constantly Performs Safety Checks
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust that things are actually ready unless {2}\
  \ personally verifies them. Gear, positioning, escape routes - {2} checks everything twice, then\
  \ once more just in case. "{0}, we''re on a schedule." "Yeah? And we''re also alive because I\
  \ don''t skip steps."
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} expects things to go wrong, so {2} prepares before they\
  \ do. {1} inspects equipment, tests redundancies, and always runs {6} own last-minute diagnostics.\
  \ {5} {8} groans every time {2} slows them down - until the one time {2} catches something everyone\
  \ else missed.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what happens when people rush. The gear that\
  \ fails, the comms that don''t transmit, the backup plans that weren''t actually ready when needed.\
  \ {1}''s watched people die from mistakes they never even knew they made. So {2} checks, and checks\
  \ again - because if {2} doesn''t, no one else will.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to sign off on anything until {2}''s gone over it\
  \ personally. "Just approve it, {0}." "Not until I check it first." People call {4} overly\
  \ cautious, but {6} work never fails.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t cut corners. If there''s a safety protocol, {2}\
  \ follows it exactly. If there''s an inspection process, {2} does it in full. People complain, but\
  \ they also know they''ve never had a preventable failure under {6} watch.
CHECKS_WEAPON_SAFETY.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just careful - {2}''s haunted. {1}''s seen shortcuts cost\
  \ lives, seen people trust systems that weren''t actually ready. If {2} seems obsessive, if {2}\
  \ slows things down, it''s because {2} knows what happens when people assume things are fine. And\
  \ {2} refuses to let it happen again.

CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.label=Prefers Things Up Close
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in fighting from afar. {1} moves in fast,\
  \ cuts down space, and engages up close where {2} can see the fear in their eyes. "Why keep your\
  \ enemies at a distance when you can make sure they stay down?"
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1.COMBATANT={0} sees long-range engagements as impersonal, inefficient,\
  \ and, worst of all, boring. {1} thrives where things are fast, brutal, and decided in seconds.\
  \ "If I''m fighting," {2} says, cracking {6} knuckles, "I want them to know it was me."
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t take chances. {1}''s seen enemies get back up when\
  \ people thought they were dead. {1}''s watched someone turn away too soon, only to be caught off\
  \ guard. {1} fights up close because when {2} ends something, {2} makes sure it stays ended.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t do passive solutions. If something needs fixing,\
  \ {2}''s right there, hands-on, making sure it''s handled properly. {1} doesn''t trust distant\
  \ coordination - {2} gets in the thick of it.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has no patience for discussions from across a room. {1}\
  \ closes distance, gets right in front of whoever {2}''s talking to, and makes sure they feel the\
  \ weight of {6} words. It''s not aggression - it''s just how {2} operates. But people definitely take\
  \ it that way.
CLOSE_COMBAT_PREF.description.2.SUPPORT={0} hates distance - not just in fights, but in anything. If\
  \ {2}''s involved, {2} wants to be right there, in the moment, in control. {1}''s seen what happens\
  \ when you rely on detached solutions. Distance means risk. Distance means failure. And {2} won''t\
  \ allow it.

COMBAT_POET.label=Recites Poetry
COMBAT_POET.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} narrates the moment. Whether it''s\
  \ ancient war poetry, battlefield elegies, or lines of verse that no one else recognizes, {2}\
  \ speaks as if {2}''s seen this all before. "Bent double, we cursed through sludge; till towards\
  \ our distant rest began to trudge."
COMBAT_POET.description.1.COMBATANT=When the fight begins, {0}''s voice is calm, rhythmic,\
  \ measured. A stanza here, a line there, whispered into comms like a battle hymn. {5} {8}\
  \ doesn''t know whether to be inspired or unsettled. {5} enemies? They just think {2}''s insane.
COMBAT_POET.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t recite poetry for theatrics. {1} does it because\
  \ it''s how {2} copes. The right words make chaos feel structured, give meaning to the things {2}''d\
  \ rather not think about. If {2} stops speaking, if {2} stops finding words for the war, then {2}''ll\
  \ have to admit that none of it ever had meaning to begin with.
COMBAT_POET.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just talk - {2} quotes. Team meetings? A few\
  \ lines about the passing of time. Emergency briefings? Something about the toil of labor.\
  \ Whether anyone appreciates it or not, {2} has a verse for everything.
COMBAT_POET.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t just answer questions - {2}''ll answer them in poetry.\
  \ Sometimes it''s {6} own, sometimes it''s old, forgotten texts, and sometimes it''s just whatever\
  \ fits the mood. "{0}, can you just say yes?" "I could - but where''s the beauty in that?"
COMBAT_POET.description.2.SUPPORT={0} speaks in poetry because it keeps the emptiness at bay.\
  \ {1}''s seen too many things that don''t deserve to be remembered - but somehow, words make them\
  \ bearable. If {2} stops finding poetry in the world, then all that''s left is the cold, empty\
  \ void of everything that''s been lost.

CUSTOM_DECALS.label=Obsessed with Custom Decals
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t leave anything plain. Armor, weapons,\
  \ vehicles - everything gets a custom touch. Whether it''s hand-painted insignias, personal mottos,\
  \ or intricate symbols only {2} understands, {6} gear is always distinctively {6}.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s decals aren''t random; they mean something. Every\
  \ marking tells a story - some a warning, some a remembrance. When people ask what they mean, {2}\
  \ gives different answers every time. Maybe they''re just for {4}. Maybe they''re for the people\
  \ who won''t live to see the next one.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows the war doesn''t guarantee survival. But {6}\
  \ decals? They might last longer than {2} does. Maybe someone will see them one day, wonder who\
  \ {2} was, what {2} fought for. Maybe that''s enough. Maybe that''s all anyone can really hope for.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to let anything be generic. {5} tools, {6}\
  \ workstation, even {6} reports have some kind of personalized insignia. If someone borrows\
  \ something of {6}, they''ll know - because {6} signature touch is everywhere.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats the unit insignia like a necessary part of life.\
  \ A blank wall? Unacceptable. An untouched case? Needs a mark. Whether it''s subtle or elaborate,\
  \ {2} finds a way to leave the company''s insignia on everything {2} works with.
CUSTOM_DECALS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} personalizes things because {2} knows how quickly people\
  \ disappear. How fast their names are forgotten. If {2} can''t control anything else, {2} can at\
  \ least leave behind something unique. If the war erases everything else, at least someone might\
  \ one day see {6} mark and remember {2} existed.

DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.label=Displays Trophies from Past Accomplishments
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} collects proof of {6} victories.\
  \ Spent shell casings, pieces of damaged armor, insignias from defeated foes - {6} personal space\
  \ is covered in relics from past engagements. "You keep all this junk for a reason?" someone\
  \ asks. {0} smirks. "It''s not junk. It''s history."
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s trophies aren''t just for {4}self. {1} keeps them\
  \ visible, a reminder of what {2}''s done and what {2}''s capable of. Some see them as badges of\
  \ honor. Others see them as a warning - a quiet message that {0} isn''t someone to be\
  \ underestimated.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps trophies not out of pride, but because if {2}\
  \ doesn''t, what was it all for? Every token, every relic is a reminder that {2} survived, that {6}\
  \ actions meant something. Without them, everything {2}''s done might as well be forgotten. And\
  \ that''s something {2} refuses to let happen.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s workspace is full of personal trophies. Awards,\
  \ certificates, old mission patches - anything that proves {2}''s been here, that {2}''s done something\
  \ worth remembering. If someone asks about them, {2}''ll always have a story ready.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just display {6} accomplishments - {2} relives them.\
  \ Every object on {6} shelf, every framed relic has a meaning, a memory. Whether people see them\
  \ as inspiring or self-indulgent, one thing is certain: {0} remembers everything {2}''s done.
DISPLAYS_TROPHIES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t collect trophies for vanity. {1} collects them\
  \ because {2} knows how quickly people disappear. {1}''s seen names erased, legacies forgotten. If\
  \ {2} keeps these reminders, maybe someone will remember {2} was here. Maybe that will be enough.

DO_IT_YOURSELF.label=Obsessive Do-It-Yourselfer
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust factory settings or off-the-shelf\
  \ solutions. If {2}''s using something, {2}''s modified it {4}self. "Standard issue? Yeah, no\
  \ thanks." {5} gear is a patchwork of custom fixes, reinforced parts, and things no one else\
  \ fully understands.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1.COMBATANT={0} won''t wait for specialists. {1} adjusts {6} gear, {2}\
  \ repairs {6} equipment, and {2} makes sure everything works {6} way. "You sure that''s safe?"\
  \ someone asks as {2} rewires a system. "No," {0} says, "but now it actually works."
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen things fail - equipment breaking when it\
  \ shouldn''t, systems failing at the worst possible moment. {1} doesn''t trust standard designs,\
  \ because {2}''s seen what happens when they let people down. If {2} can build it, fix it, or\
  \ improve it {4}self, at least {2} knows who to blame if it fails.
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in pre-fabricated anything. If there''s a\
  \ problem, {2} builds {6} own fix. {5} workspace is filled with half-finished projects, custom\
  \ tools, and modifications that no one else quite understands. "Why use stock solutions when you\
  \ can make something better?"
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t use a tool without tweaking it first. Every system\
  \ {2} interacts with has some kind of {0}-approved modification. It''s not official, but it works\
  \ better now. "You didn''t like how it worked, so you just changed it?" someone asks. {0} nods.\
  \ "And now it''s right."
DO_IT_YOURSELF.description.2.SUPPORT={0} customizes everything because {2}''s seen too many things\
  \ fail when they shouldn''t. People trust that things will work the way they''re designed. {0}\
  \ knows better. If {2} built it, if {2} reinforced it, then at least {2} knows it won''t fail the\
  \ moment it''s needed most

FIELD_IMPROVISER.label=Improvises with Field Supplies
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t worry about not having the right tools - {2} makes\
  \ do. A broken weapon, a missing component, an unexpected failure? {1}''s already rigging up a\
  \ solution with whatever {2} can scavenge. "You''d be amazed what you can build with a little\
  \ ingenuity and a complete lack of better options."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just prepare - {2} adapts. If something isn''t\
  \ working, {2} modifies it on the fly. If supplies run out, {2} finds something else that works.\
  \ "You can carry everything you need," {2} says, grinning, "or you can just get creative when it\
  \ matters."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t expect things to be available when needed. Ammo\
  \ runs dry. Equipment fails. Reinforcements don''t come. {1}''s learned to use what''s around {4}\
  \ because it''s always better than waiting for something that isn''t coming.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} won''t stop a task just because {2}''s missing one thing. If\
  \ something''s broken, {2} fixes it with whatever''s on hand. If a system isn''t cooperating, {2} rigs\
  \ up a workaround. "Not the cleanest fix," {2} mutters, "but it works, and that''s what matters."
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t wait for official repair parts or standardized\
  \ procedures - {2} figures something out. Need a replacement component? {1}''ll find one. Can''t access\
  \ a system? {1}''ll bypass it. The methods might not be by the book, but somehow, they always work.
FIELD_IMPROVISER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen people fail because they waited for the proper\
  \ tools or the right conditions. {1}''s seen how fast things go wrong. So {2} never assumes {2}''ll\
  \ have what {2} needs. {1} just makes things work - because the alternative is losing everything\
  \ while waiting for something that will never arrive.

LOUD_COMMS.label=Uses Loud Comms
LOUD_COMMS.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s voice booms over comms, whether it''s necessary or not.\
  \ "I SAID LEFT FLANK - ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?" {1} insists it''s for clarity, but {6} {8} is\
  \ pretty sure their eardrums are suffering more than the enemy.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just issue orders - {2} broadcasts them like a\
  \ declaration of war. If the enemy wasn''t listening before, they definitely are now. {5} {8}\
  \ isn''t sure if it''s intimidation or recklessness, but one thing''s for sure: {2}''s impossible to\
  \ ignore.
LOUD_COMMS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} hates silence. {1}''s seen comms go dead before - heard the\
  \ static where voices used to be. So {2} shouts, {2} yells, {2} forces noise into the\
  \ channel - because if {2}''s still hearing responses, then at least someone is still alive.
LOUD_COMMS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t do quiet radio chatter. {5} voice comes through\
  \ clear, sharp, and way too loud. "CONFIRMING STATUS - DO YOU COPY?" Even when no one needs {4} to\
  \ be that loud, {2} does it anyway.
LOUD_COMMS.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s comms volume is permanently set to maximum. Whether {2}''s\
  \ giving an update, issuing a routine report, or just checking in, it''s like {2}''s trying to reach\
  \ someone five jumps away. "{0}, we can hear you just fine." "GOOD."
LOUD_COMMS.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s been on channels that have gone quiet. Too quiet. The\
  \ kind of quiet that means something''s gone very wrong. So {2} keeps {6} voice loud, {6} comms\
  \ open, {6} presence unignorable. Because if the signal ever drops, if the voices ever cut out,\
  \ {2} knows exactly what that means.

WAR_STORIES.label=Overly Fond of War Stories
WAR_STORIES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a story for every situation. "This reminds me of that\
  \ time on New Aragon - similar terrain, same terrible odds, and guess what? We made it through that\
  \ one too." {5} {8} isn''t sure whether {2}''s boosting morale or just reliving {6} favorite\
  \ moments.
WAR_STORIES.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s stories are legendary, but also suspect. One day, it''s\
  \ a tale of {4} holding off an entire battalion with nothing but a sidearm. The next, {2}''s\
  \ outdriving an artillery barrage on foot. {5} {8} humors {4}, but no one''s ever seen any\
  \ records to back them up.
WAR_STORIES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} tells stories not because they''re entertaining, but\
  \ because {2} refuses to let people be forgotten. {1} speaks of old battles, fallen comrades,\
  \ places that don''t exist anymore. {1} remembers so that others won''t have to. Or maybe, because\
  \ {2} knows no one else will.
WAR_STORIES.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what''s happening, {0} can connect it to something\
  \ {2} saw, heard about, or was totally involved in. "Supply problems? Ha! Back on Trellwan, we ran\
  \ an entire op on half-rations. Let me tell you - " Everyone knows once {2} starts, it''s impossible\
  \ to stop {4}.
WAR_STORIES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just tell war stories - {2} lives them, relives\
  \ them, makes them part of everything {2} does. {1} references past battles like they''re life\
  \ lessons, dropping names of people no one else remembers. To {4}, the past isn''t just the\
  \ past - it''s the foundation of everything now.
WAR_STORIES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps telling the same war stories because {2} knows one\
  \ day, there won''t be anyone left who remembers them. {1} describes battles in vivid detail,\
  \ speaks the names of the dead like a prayer, and acts as if saying them out loud is the only\
  \ thing keeping them real. Maybe it is.

ALL_OR_NOTHING.label=All or Nothing
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hesitate. {1} fights with everything or not at\
  \ all. If {2}''s going in, {2}''s committed, and {2} expects everyone else to be the same. "We don''t\
  \ half-win fights," {2} growls. "We either walk away or we don''t."
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in measured risks. {1} doesn''t pull back,\
  \ doesn''t hold back, and never takes a fight expecting to retreat. "If you''re already in, then be\
  \ all in." {1}''s either the first in the fight or the last one standing. There is no middle ground.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} commits fully to every action because {2}''s seen what\
  \ happens to people who hesitate. The ones who second-guess, who try to find a safer option, who\
  \ hesitate at the wrong moment - they don''t survive. So {2} doesn''t stop. {1} doesn''t hesitate. {1}\
  \ just goes.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t do halfway. If {2}''s assigned a task, it''s getting\
  \ done completely - to the best possible standard. If {2} doesn''t think it''s worth doing right, {2}\
  \ won''t do it at all. "It''s either perfect, or it''s garbage," {2} mutters, redoing something for\
  \ the third time.
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just commit - {2} overcommits. If {2}''s fixing\
  \ something, it''s getting rebuilt from scratch. If {2}''s preparing for a job, {2}''s triple-checking\
  \ everything. "You don''t need to go that far," someone says. {0} just shrugs. "If you''re doing\
  \ something, why not do it completely?"
ALL_OR_NOTHING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in partial effort because {2}''s seen how\
  \ easily things fall apart. The almost-finished defenses that didn''t hold. The half-prepared\
  \ plans that led to disaster. {1} either does things fully, or {2} doesn''t do them at all - because\
  \ anything in between is just waiting for failure to happen.

BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.label=Prefers Grounded Tactics
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust high-level strategies or overcomplicated\
  \ maneuvers. {1} believes victory comes from direct control, from positioning, from knowing\
  \ exactly what''s happening in the fight - not from a distant command center. "You want to win? Get\
  \ your hands dirty and see the fight yourself."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t put faith in big-picture strategies. {1} focuses\
  \ on where {2} is, who {2}''s with, and what''s in front of {4}. {1}''s more interested in terrain,\
  \ cover, movement - things that actually decide a battle. "Grand strategies are great until\
  \ someone''s got a knife at your throat."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen how large-scale strategies sacrifice the people\
  \ actually fighting. {1}''s seen plans drawn up by those who never have to bleed for them. {1}\
  \ trusts what''s real, what {2} can see, what {2} can control. Because {2} knows that when things go\
  \ wrong, it''s not the planners who suffer - it''s the ones actually in the fight.
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t waste time on high-level theories. {1} cares about\
  \ what actually works, what affects people on the ground. If a plan doesn''t hold up in real\
  \ conditions, {2} won''t even consider it. "Looks great on paper. Means nothing if it doesn''t work\
  \ down here."
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in complicated tactics. If something can''t\
  \ be explained in one sentence, {2} doesn''t trust it. {1} values direct execution over drawn-out\
  \ planning and believes the simplest strategies are usually the ones that actually succeed.
BOOTS_ON_THE_GROUND.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen plans fail because they were designed too far\
  \ from the action. {1}''s seen people die following strategies that didn''t account for real\
  \ conditions. {1} only trusts what can be seen, tested, and done in the moment - because that''s what\
  \ actually decides who lives and dies.

BRAVERY_BOASTER.label=Boasts About Bravery
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} always has a story about the time {2} stood {6} ground\
  \ against impossible odds. Whether it was charging into fire, refusing to retreat, or staring\
  \ down a superior force without blinking - {2} makes sure everyone knows about it. "You think this\
  \ is bad? Let me tell you about the time I - "
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} acts like fear is something other people experience. {1}\
  \ tells stories loudly, emphasizing every detail of how {2} stood firm when others might have run.\
  \ Whether it''s completely true or not? Well, that depends on who''s asking.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} tells and retells {6} tales of bravery because {2} needs\
  \ them to matter. {1} needs people to see {4} as fearless, as someone who never wavered, as\
  \ someone worth remembering. Because deep down, {2} knows that in war, the forgotten are already\
  \ dead.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.0.SUPPORT=No matter what the situation is, {0} has a bravery story to\
  \ match. "Dangerous? Hah! You should''ve seen the time I - " It doesn''t matter what''s happening - {2}\
  \ always has a tale of personal valor ready to share.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats even minor incidents like acts of heroism. {1}\
  \ recounts how {2} bravely handled a malfunctioning system, how {2} stood firm during a minor\
  \ crisis, how {2} didn''t even flinch when things went south. It might be over-the-top, but it''s\
  \ hard not to admire the confidence.
BRAVERY_BOASTER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just tell stories - {2} builds a legend. {1}''s seen\
  \ too many people fade into history, forgotten as just another name on a list. So {2} makes sure\
  \ {6} bravery is known, repeated, and impossible to ignore. Because in war, being remembered is\
  \ the only way to live forever.

COCKPIT_DRIFTER.label=Daydreams
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s mind wanders at the worst possible times. Mid-mission,\
  \ mid-firefight, even while waiting for an enemy to make a move - {2}''s caught staring into the\
  \ distance, lost in thought. "{0}, focus!" someone shouts. {1} blinks, snapping back. "Yeah,\
  \ yeah - I was just thinking."
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} fights hard, but {6} mind is elsewhere. {1} dreams about\
  \ what {2}''d do if {2} weren''t here, imagines different places, different battles, different\
  \ endings. Sometimes, {2} wonders if {2}''ll ever get to see any of them.
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t drift off because {2}''s careless - {2} does it\
  \ because {2} needs to escape. If {2} stays too present in the moment, the weight of everything - of\
  \ war, of loss, of survival - might finally break {4}. So {2} lets {4}self slip away, just for a\
  \ moment, to somewhere better.
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can be in the middle of a conversation, a report, or an\
  \ important check - and then, suddenly, {2}''s somewhere else entirely. Staring into space, fingers\
  \ idle, completely gone until someone snaps {4} back. "{0}, did you hear anything I just\
  \ said?" "Uh... most of it?"
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has an entire universe in {6} head. Sometimes {2}''s\
  \ reminiscing, sometimes {2}''s planning, and sometimes... well, even {2}''s not sure where {2} just\
  \ went. "What are you thinking about?" someone asks. {0} blinks. "Oh, uh. Stuff."
COCKPIT_DRIFTER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} lets {6} mind wander because the alternative is staring\
  \ reality in the face for too long. When supplies run low, when losses pile up, when everything\
  \ feels like it''s crumbling - sometimes, the only way to keep moving is to imagine something other\
  \ than this.

CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.label=Believes in Conspiracy Theories
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust anything at face value. Every mission has\
  \ another layer, every battle is part of some bigger scheme. "You think this is just a simple\
  \ engagement? Please. Someone up top is pulling the strings - we just don''t know why yet."
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.1.COMBATANT={0} connects everything to a larger plot. If an enemy force\
  \ is moving strangely, if supply lines are disrupted, if things just feel off - {2} has a theory. It\
  \ might be paranoia, but every now and then, {2}''s right, and that''s the most dangerous part.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen too many warriors die for no reason, seen\
  \ decisions made that make no sense unless someone in command is playing a bigger game. {1}\
  \ doesn''t just suspect conspiracies - {2} knows they exist. {1} just hasn''t figured out who''s really\
  \ behind them yet.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.0.SUPPORT=A system crash? Sabotage. A delayed shipment? Intentional supply\
  \ manipulation. A bad weather pattern? They''re controlling it. {0} always has a conspiracy\
  \ theory, and it''s never just an accident.
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just believe in conspiracies - {2}''s trying to wake\
  \ everyone else up. "You think it''s just bad luck? That''s what they want you to think." {1} has\
  \ charts, data, and an alarming amount of unofficial sources to back up {6} claims. "Wake up,\
  \ sheeple!"
CONSPIRACY_THEORIST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen what happens to people who don''t ask questions.\
  \ {1}''s watched things disappear, people vanish, records rewritten. {1} doesn''t just think someone\
  \ is hiding something - {2} knows. The problem is, the deeper {2} digs, the more {2} starts to wonder\
  \ if {2}''s better off not knowing at all.

DEVOUT_WARRIOR.label=Warrior''s Code Devotee
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t fight just to win; {2} fights the right way. {1}\
  \ has rules, a code, a line {2} won''t cross - even if it would make things easier. "Honor matters,"\
  \ {2} says. "Without it, we''re just killers in metal coffins."
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just live by {6} warrior''s code - {2} expects others\
  \ to respect it. {1} looks down on cowardly tactics, refuses to dishonor a battlefield, and has no\
  \ patience for those who fight without principle. "A victory without honor isn''t a victory at\
  \ all," {2} mutters.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what war does to people - how it strips them of\
  \ identity, of morality, of who they once were. {1} follows a warrior''s code because without it,\
  \ {2}''s afraid of what {2} might become. Maybe the rules don''t always make sense. But without them,\
  \ what''s left of {4}?
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} approaches {6} work with the discipline of a warrior. {1}\
  \ follows personal principles, respects hierarchy and tradition, and refuses to cut corners. To\
  \ {4}, every role is part of the battle, and {2} performs {6} with absolute dedication.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} holds {4}self - and others - to a standard. {1} believes in\
  \ honesty, integrity, and respect for the craft. Even in the most mundane work, {2} acts as though\
  \ {2}''s upholding something greater than {4}self.
DEVOUT_WARRIOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen rules bend and break in the face of war. {1}''s\
  \ watched people compromise their values to survive. {1} refuses. {1} follows a code because if {2}\
  \ doesn''t, then nothing means anything anymore.

DUAL_WIELDING.label=Obsessed with Multitasking
DUAL_WIELDING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in singular focus. {1}''s coordinating\
  \ movements, rechecking systems, listening to multiple comms channels - all while actively engaging\
  \ the enemy. "You can focus on one thing at a time," {2} scoffs. "Or you can actually keep up."
DUAL_WIELDING.description.1.COMBATANT={0} refuses to let {6} mind sit still. If {2}''s not actively\
  \ juggling multiple tasks, {2} feels like {2}''s falling behind. {1} strategizes, analyzes, and\
  \ fights simultaneously, sometimes to the point of overloading {4}self.
DUAL_WIELDING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just multitask - {2} needs to. If {2} focuses on just\
  \ one thing, the weight of everything else creeps in. The war, the losses, the endless cycle. So\
  \ {2} keeps {6} mind running on everything at once - because stopping means thinking, and thinking\
  \ means facing reality.
DUAL_WIELDING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can''t just do one thing. {1}''s managing logistics while\
  \ checking reports, fixing a system while answering a question, tracking work statuses while\
  \ already planning for the next crisis. "How many tasks are you even handling right now?" someone\
  \ asks. {0} shrugs. "All of them."
DUAL_WIELDING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} treats downtime like a failure. If {2}''s not working on\
  \ multiple things at once, {2} feels unproductive. Even when others tell {4} to slow down, {2}\
  \ refuses. "If I don''t do it all, who will?"
DUAL_WIELDING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen disasters happen because someone missed a detail,\
  \ forgot a step, or didn''t track everything properly. {1} refuses to let that happen. {1} tracks\
  \ everything, all the time, even if it means {2}''s always on the edge of burnout.

EMBLEM_LOVER.label=Attached to a Personal Emblem
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s personal emblem isn''t just a symbol - it''s who {2} is.\
  \ It''s on {6} armor, {6} gear, everything {2} owns. It represents loyalty, legacy, and purpose. If\
  \ anyone disrespects it, they disrespect {4}. And {0} doesn''t take that lightly.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} makes sure {6} personal emblem is visible in every\
  \ engagement. {1} believes in its meaning, its history, and what it stands for. "If I go down," {2}\
  \ mutters, adjusting it before a battle, "I go down under this symbol."
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has lost people, places, and parts of {4}self to war, but\
  \ {6} personal emblem remains. It''s the one thing {2} can still control. If that symbol is still\
  \ standing, then so is {2}.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} marks everything with {6} personal emblem - {6} uniform, {6}\
  \ tools, even {6} personal workspace. Whether it''s nostalgia, pride, or something deeper, one\
  \ thing is clear: {2} won''t be seen without it.
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just wear {6} personal emblem - {2} preserves it. {1}\
  \ keeps it pristine, properly positioned, and never altered. If it''s faded or damaged, {2} fixes\
  \ it immediately. "This isn''t just decoration," {2} mutters. "It matters."
EMBLEM_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} keeps {6} personal emblem close because {2} needs to. It''s\
  \ a reminder of who {2} used to be, before the war, before the losses, before everything changed.\
  \ If {2} ever loses it, {2}''s afraid {2} might lose {4}self, too.

EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.label=Obsessive Debriefer
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} analyzes. The moment a battle ends,\
  \ {2}''s already dissecting what worked and what didn''t. Positioning, timing, individual\
  \ performance - nothing escapes review. "We got through it," someone says. "Yeah," {0} mutters,\
  \ taking notes, "but how much better could it have gone?"
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1.COMBATANT={0} refuses to let mistakes go unnoticed. If something went\
  \ wrong, {2} will find out why. {1} doesn''t let anyone leave a mission without a full breakdown.\
  \ "This isn''t criticism," {2} insists. "It''s survival. We learn, or we don''t make it next time."
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just analyze because {2} wants to - {2} does it\
  \ because {2} has to. {1}''s seen one overlooked detail turn into disaster. {1} reviews everything\
  \ because {2} knows somewhere in the data is the difference between living and dying next time.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to let a task go unexamined. After every\
  \ operation, {2} compiles full reports, goes over every detail, and demands everyone provide\
  \ feedback. "We don''t just move on - we improve."
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t let anything be dismissed as ''good enough''. Every\
  \ procedure, every decision, every single mistake gets analyzed in-depth. Some people find it\
  \ exhausting, but they also know that when {0} reviews something, nothing gets missed.
EXCESSIVE_DEBRIEFING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t stop reviewing because {2}''s seen what happens when\
  \ people don''t learn fast enough. {1} knows one miscalculation can doom everything. So {2} analyzes\
  \ relentlessly, because if something ever goes wrong again, it won''t be because {2} didn''t see it\
  \ coming.

EYE_FOR_ART.label=Appreciates Battlefield Scenery
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just see battlefields as places of destruction - {2}\
  \ sees art in the chaos. A burning skyline, the eerie silence before an engagement, the way smoke\
  \ curls against the horizon - {2} notices it all. "War is ugly," {2} says, watching the sunrise over\
  \ wreckage, "but sometimes, it''s damn beautiful too."
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1.COMBATANT=While others focus purely on tactics, {0} catches {4}self\
  \ staring at the way light reflects off armor, how dust settles after an explosion, how the world\
  \ keeps moving even in battle. It''s not distraction - it''s perspective. "You ever really look at a\
  \ battlefield?" {2} asks. "Not just fight in it, but see it?"
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2.COMBATANT={0} takes in every detail, every skyline, every storm rolling\
  \ over the wasteland - not because {2} enjoys it, but because {2} knows it might be the last view {2}\
  \ ever has. In war, moments of beauty are fleeting, and {2} refuses to let them go unnoticed.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t let war completely consume {6} senses. Even in the\
  \ middle of crisis management, {2}''ll stop to notice the way dust swirls in the floodlights, the\
  \ eerie beauty of a battle-scarred skyline, the quiet hum of a base before deployment.
EYE_FOR_ART.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just see battlefields as tactical locations - {2}\
  \ appreciates them like landscapes. The shifting sands of a desert warzone, the glowing embers of\
  \ a city fight, the way ice cracks underfoot on frozen battlefields. "Everywhere has a mood," {2}\
  \ mutters. "You just have to notice it."
EYE_FOR_ART.description.2.SUPPORT={0} watches the way rain falls on ruined buildings, the way\
  \ wind howls through shattered forests, the way the sky remains untouched no matter how much\
  \ destruction unfolds beneath it. {1} clings to these small glimpses of beauty because if there''s\
  \ still beauty, maybe there''s still something worth fighting for.

FAST_TALKER.label=Talks Very Fast
FAST_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s mouth moves as fast as {6} mind - battle reports, status\
  \ updates, strategy shifts - all at rapid-fire speed. "Enemy left - no, two left - no, they''re\
  \ repositioning - okay, we move now now now!" {5} {8} is used to having to translate {6} comm\
  \ chatter into something understandable.
FAST_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} does not pause. {1} dumps all relevant information in one\
  \ long, breathless stream - sometimes before anyone even asks for it. "{0}, slow down." "No time\
  \ slowing wastes seconds seconds cost lives MOVE NOW."
FAST_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} words fast, {6} thoughts faster, because if {2}\
  \ slows down, the memories catch up. The losses, the failures, the ghosts of voices {2}''ll never\
  \ hear again. So {2} keeps talking - because silence is worse.
FAST_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t pause - {2} runs through sentences like they''re a\
  \ race. Reports, updates, even casual conversations come out in one long unbroken stream. "Okay\
  \ so here''s the situation - supplies are low not critical but getting there plus we need to\
  \ reallocate resources or we''re gonna have a big problem in maybe 36 hours max."
FAST_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} delivers every report, every status update, at maximum\
  \ speed, but somehow, {2} never actually misses a detail. It''s like {6} brain moves faster than\
  \ everyone else''s - or maybe {2}''s just used to thinking three steps ahead.
FAST_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t stop moving, doesn''t stop talking, because\
  \ stopping means having to think about how bad things really are. If {2} just keeps moving, keeps\
  \ explaining, analyzing, summarizing, maybe {2} won''t have to acknowledge just how close\
  \ everything is to falling apart.

FINGER_GUNS.label=Uses Finger Guns
FINGER_GUNS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} can drop an enemy, turn to {6} buddy, and still fire off a\
  \ pair of finger guns like {2}''s just landed a perfect shot in a bar trick. "Got ''em." {5} {8}\
  \ can''t decide if it''s confidence or insanity, but it''s definitely amusing.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1.COMBATANT=Mid-battle, mid-debrief, mid-anything, {0} will fire off a\
  \ quick finger gun with a cocky grin. "We got this." Somehow, it works - {6} {8} actually feels a\
  \ little steadier. Maybe it''s the certainty. Maybe it''s the absurdity. Either way, it helps.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} cracks a finger gun after every fight, no matter how bad\
  \ it got. It''s habit, a ritual, a lifeline. Because if {2} stops joking - if {2} stops acting like\
  \ any of this is normal - then {2}''ll have to face just how much of {4}self this war has taken.
FINGER_GUNS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just use finger guns ironically - {2} fully commits\
  \ to them. Affirmation? Finger guns. Acknowledgment? Finger guns. Encouragement? Double finger\
  \ guns with a nod for extra effect.
FINGER_GUNS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has an uncanny sense for when things are getting too\
  \ tense. Right before things boil over, {2} fires off a well-timed finger gun and a grin just wide\
  \ enough to throw people off. It shouldn''t work - but it does.
FINGER_GUNS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} throws out a pair of finger guns like it''s all under\
  \ control. Like things aren''t crumbling, like the latest casualty report doesn''t hurt, like {2}''s\
  \ still the guy who can crack jokes and keep going. Because if {2} ever stops... what then?

FLARE_DEPLOYER.label=Excessive NavPoint Use
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} drops so many NavPoints that {6} {8} has learned to\
  \ ignore half of them. "{0}, why are there ten markers on the map?" "Different angles,\
  \ alternate routes, and in case something changes." "You marked a rock." "That''s not just any\
  \ rock, that one looks like my old instructor!"
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s tactical HUD is covered in NavPoints. Enemy positions,\
  \ possible hazards, ideal cover spots, backup escape routes - it''s all plotted in real time. It''s\
  \ excessive. It''s cluttered. But somehow, {2} never gets lost, and {2}''s always in the right spot.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2.COMBATANT={0}''s not just throwing down NavPoints for fun. {1}''s seen\
  \ people die because they missed a critical detail. {1} maps everything - not because {2} needs to,\
  \ but because if {2} doesn''t, {2}''s terrified {2}''ll miss something important. And in war, one wrong\
  \ step means someone doesn''t come home.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just provide coordinates - {2} floods the system with\
  \ them. "{0}, we only needed a single NavPoint." "Yeah, but I thought you''d want a secondary, a\
  \ tertiary, and a contingency in case of sudden emergencies."
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t trust anyone to just remember directions. If there''s\
  \ a system for marking locations, {2}''s using it to the extreme. Maps, overlays, and digital\
  \ routes all get a ridiculous amount of detail.
FLARE_DEPLOYER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t marking maps out of habit - {2}''s doing it because {2}''s\
  \ been in situations where people got lost, where wrong turns led to death, where missing a\
  \ NavPoint meant disaster. If the map is overloaded, so be it. At least no one can say they\
  \ didn''t know where to go.

FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.label=Likes to "Interrogate" Teammates
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just accept things at face value - {2} needs\
  \ details. If a teammate makes a weird call, if someone hesitates, if a decision seems off, {2}''s\
  \ on them immediately. "Why''d you take that route? What were you thinking? Did you see something\
  \ I didn''t?"
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.1.COMBATANT=After every battle, {0} grills {6} teammates like an\
  \ overzealous investigator. "What were you thinking when you did that?" "How''d that shot feel?"\
  \ "Would you do it differently next time?" It''s not hostile - it''s just... relentless.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just nosy - {2}''s paranoid. {1}''s seen too many people\
  \ make mistakes that cost lives. If {2} questions everything, then maybe {2}''ll catch something\
  \ before it gets {4} or someone else killed.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} needs to know why people do what they do. If someone takes\
  \ an unexpected approach, if a decision seems even slightly unusual, {2}''s asking way too many\
  \ questions about it. "Oh, interesting choice - why? No, really, walk me through it."
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t accept simple answers. "Because it works" isn''t\
  \ good enough - {2} wants process, reasoning, philosophy. "Yeah, but why do you think that? And what\
  \ if you had to do it without that resource?" {5} teammates have learned to be very prepared when\
  \ talking to {4}.
FRIENDLY_INTERROGATOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} asks too many questions because {2}''s seen what happens\
  \ when people don''t talk. {1}''s seen people sit on critical information, small hesitations that\
  \ later got people killed. So now? {1} asks, and {2} keeps asking until {2}''s satisfied.

GUN_NUT.label=Fascinated by Ancient Firearms
GUN_NUT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just a warrior - {2}''s a historian of destruction.\
  \ Every time {2} picks up a new weapon, {2}''s comparing it to ancient ballistic arms. "You think\
  \ this is impressive? Back in the 20th century, they were pulling off headshots with iron sights\
  \ and lead slugs."
GUN_NUT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just admire ancient firearms - {2} trusts them.\
  \ "Give me a well-maintained slug thrower over some overcomplicated energy weapon any day," {2}\
  \ grumbles. {1} swears by mechanical reliability over computer-assisted targeting.
GUN_NUT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows war has always been brutal, but {2} can''t help but\
  \ feel that something was different back then. Fights were personal, weapons required\
  \ craftsmanship, and victory was skill, not just tech superiority. {1} wonders if warriors of the\
  \ past would laugh at how detached war has become - or pity them for how much worse it''s gotten.
GUN_NUT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just study ancient firearms - {2} talks about them\
  \ constantly. No matter the topic, {2} finds a way to bring up old-world guns. "Oh, supply\
  \ logistics? You know, back in the 21st century..."
GUN_NUT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has way too many files, blueprints, and records of\
  \ obsolete ballistic weaponry. {5} personal workspace has framed diagrams of revolver mechanisms\
  \ and printed-out accounts of ancient battlefield tactics. "{0}, why do you have three separate\
  \ books on bolt-action rifles?" "Because they''re beautiful."
GUN_NUT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just admire old weapons - {2} sees them as a relic of\
  \ a different kind of war. Battles with clear fronts, clear enemies, clear objectives. Now? Now,\
  \ war never ends, and technology only makes it colder, more distant. Maybe, just maybe, the\
  \ warriors of old understood something they''ve all forgotten.

LAST_MAN_STANDING.label=Last Man Standing Mentality
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.0.COMBATANT={0} goes into every battle assuming {2}''ll be the last one\

  \ the best, plan for the worst," {2} mutters, "And the worst is usually me alone, fighting to the\
  \ end."
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t stop. No matter how bad things get, no matter how\
  \ many people fall around {4}, {2} keeps going. "Retreat?" {2} scoffs. "You can retreat if you\
  \ want. I''ll be here when you decide to push forward again."
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows how this goes. {1}''s watched {8}s get wiped out,\
  \ seen friends disappear from the comms, been the only one left in the aftermath. So {2} doesn''t\
  \ expect anyone to have {6} back. {1} doesn''t wait for reinforcements. {1} fights like {2}''s already\
  \ alone.
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t rely on others to clean up after a crisis - {2}\
  \ expects to be the last one handling it. "If this whole system fails, I''m the one who''s going to\
  \ be picking up the pieces. So excuse me if I make damn sure it doesn''t."
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t clock out just because {6} shift is over - if things\
  \ are falling apart, {2} stays until it''s handled. {1}''s the last one in the control room, the last\
  \ one running diagnostics, the last one making sure everything is actually stable before {2}\
  \ leaves.
LAST_MAN_STANDING.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too many disasters unfold because people assumed\
  \ someone else would handle it. {1} doesn''t trust anyone to pick up the slack, doesn''t believe in\
  \ someone else stepping in. If something needs to be done, {2} treats it like {2}''s the last person\
  \ left to do it. Because one day, {2} will be.

LEGENDARY_MEK.label=Believes in the Black Marauder
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just believe in the legend of the Black\
  \ Marauder - {2} treats it like fact. {1}''s heard the stories, maybe even witnessed the impossible.\
  \ "You ever see a {8} go silent with no explanation? Yeah. That''s it. The Black Marauder''s\
  \ real - and if it comes for you, you don''t see it coming."
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.1.COMBATANT={0} notices every oddity in combat. Glitched sensors, missing\
  \ wreckage, a {8} that should have made it back but didn''t. "This wasn''t just bad luck," {2}\
  \ mutters, staring at a battlefield that feels too quiet. "This was something else."
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen things that don''t make sense. Forces that\
  \ shouldn''t have lost, but did. Enemies that shouldn''t have survived, but didn''t just\
  \ survive - they vanished. {1} believes in the Black Marauder because {2} needs to. Because if it''s\
  \ not real, then what the hell is happening out there?
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just believe in the Black Marauder - {2} documents.\
  \ If there''s a story, {2}''s heard it. If there''s an anomaly in the records, {2}''s marked it. {1} has\
  \ an entire hidden file of unexplained incidents. "Coincidence? You really think this many\
  \ vanishings are coincidence?"
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.1.SUPPORT={0} finds a way to connect any strange occurrence to the Black\
  \ Marauder. Lost patrol? Possible sighting. Broken comms? Could be interference. Even mundane\
  \ issues somehow lead to, "You know, this exact same thing happened before a confirmed Black\
  \ Marauder event."
LEGENDARY_MEK.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too much weirdness to believe in accidents. {1}\
  \ isn''t chasing ghost stories - {2}''s trying to understand something that shouldn''t exist. Because\
  \ if the Black Marauder is real, if it''s out there, then at least there''s an answer. Even if it''s\
  \ one no one wants to hear.

PASSIVE_LEADER.label=Leads Through Passivity
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t bark commands, doesn''t dictate tactics - {2} just\
  \ moves with purpose, and people follow. {1} sets an example, makes decisions without making a\
  \ show of it, and somehow, {6} {8} ends up doing exactly what needs to be done. "I didn''t tell\
  \ you what to do," {2} shrugs. "You just figured it out."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t force control - {2} lets things unfold. {1} waits,\
  \ watches, lets people make their own calls, and only steps in when absolutely necessary. "You\
  \ don''t need me telling you what to do," {2} says. "You just need to know I''ll step in when it\
  \ actually matters."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched too many commanders micromanage their teams\
  \ into disaster. {1} knows that forcing leadership breeds hesitation - and hesitation gets people\
  \ killed. So {2} doesn''t push. {1} just moves, acts, and hopes they trust {4} enough to follow.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t in charge - but somehow, people listen to {4} anyway.\
  \ {1} doesn''t make demands, doesn''t give orders - {2} just does things the right way, and others end\
  \ up following {6} lead without realizing it.
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} lets people struggle a little, lets them make their own\
  \ choices, lets them think they''re leading themselves. And right when they need it, {2} offers\
  \ just enough of a push. "You got this," {2} says. "But if I were you, I''d check that system\
  \ first."
PASSIVE_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} refuses to be another voice barking orders. {1}''s seen how\
  \ people break under too much control, how they stop thinking for themselves. So {2} leads\
  \ quietly, indirectly - because if they believe they''re choosing to follow {4}, they''ll actually\
  \ commit to it.

REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.label=Rebellious Without Cause
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t outright refuse orders - but {2} always questions\
  \ them, always challenges them, always finds a way to make it clear that {2}''s choosing to follow,\
  \ not just obeying. "I could do it that way," {2} mutters. "Or I could do it my way - which, let''s\
  \ be real, is probably better."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t follow rules because they''re rules - {2} follows\
  \ them if they make sense to {4}. Chain of command? Optional. Discipline? Situational. If someone\
  \ tries to pull rank on {4} without proving they deserve it, {2}''ll make their life very difficult.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just push back for fun - {2} does it because {2}''s\
  \ seen what happens when people follow orders without question. {1} refuses to be another pawn,\
  \ another body thrown into the grinder. If {2} fights, if {2} follows, it''s {6} choice - not theirs.
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t break major rules - just enough to be a problem.\
  \ Skipping unnecessary steps, bypassing bureaucracy, tweaking procedures because they annoy {4}.\
  \ "Look, it still works," {2} says, grinning. "I just did it without all the nonsense."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t care if something is company policy, mission\
  \ standard, or "how things are done." If {2} doesn''t agree with it, {2}''s going to find a way\
  \ around it. "It''s not rebellion," {2} argues. "It''s efficiency."
REBEL_WITHOUT_CAUSE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched too many people get crushed by systems that\
  \ never cared about them. So {2} resists - not for a cause, not for justice, but because it keeps\
  \ {4} from becoming another cog in the machine. If {2} stops pushing back, {2}''s afraid {2}''ll lose\
  \ {4}self entirely.

SIMPLE_LIFE.label=Prefers Simple Solutions
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t waste time with overcomplicated tactics. If the\
  \ objective is clear, so is the path to victory. "Why maneuver for fifteen minutes when we can\
  \ just hit them where it hurts?" If a problem has a straightforward answer, that''s the one {2}''s\
  \ taking.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} sees people spend too much time planning when the best\
  \ solution is just doing the obvious thing. "We could run three simulations, analyze terrain\
  \ variations, and draft contingencies... or we could just shoot the thing that''s causing problems."
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched {8}s waste time on complex strategies - and\
  \ seen them die before they could execute them. {1} keeps things simple because simple keeps\
  \ people alive. The more moving parts there are, the more ways everything can fall apart.
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in unnecessary steps. If a task has five\
  \ stages, {2}''s figuring out how to do it in two. If a system is too complicated, {2}''s already\
  \ looking for a workaround. "Why do it this way when we could do it the easy way?"
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hates when people turn basic tasks into logistical\
  \ nightmares. If {2} sees someone struggling with pointless extra steps, {2} can''t help but step\
  \ in. "Just do it like this - see? Done. No headaches. Why are we making this complicated?"
SIMPLE_LIFE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t simplify things out of laziness - {2} does it because\
  \ {2}''s seen what happens when systems collapse under their own weight. The more complex something\
  \ is, the more likely it is to fail at the worst possible moment. Simple isn''t just better - it''s\
  \ safer.

ANTI_AUTHORITY.label=Distrusts Authority
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t take orders at face value. If a superior gives a\
  \ command, {6} first instinct is to question why. "Are we sure that''s not just a suicide mission\
  \ dressed up as a strategy?" {1} follows orders - sometimes - but only when {2}''s convinced they\
  \ actually make sense.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust allied command, mission planners, or anyone\
  \ not risking their own skin. {1}''s seen too many decisions made by people who never have to face\
  \ the consequences. "Oh, great, another ''brilliant strategy'' from someone sitting in an\
  \ underground, reinforced bunker."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to trust the chain of command. But then {2} saw too\
  \ many bad calls, too many good people thrown away like resources. Now, {2} assumes any order\
  \ could be the one that gets {4} - or {6} {8} - killed for someone else''s ambition.
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in transparent leadership. If someone in\
  \ charge says everything is fine, {6} first instinct is to check for {4}self. "Oh, sure, no\
  \ problems at all - except for the dozen red flags you''re ignoring."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t blindly follow procedures, policies, or team\
  \ initiatives. If leadership wants something done, they''d better have a real justification for\
  \ it. "I''m not ignoring common sense just because someone with a title says so."
ANTI_AUTHORITY.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen leadership make the wrong call, watched the\
  \ fallout, and buried the people who paid the price. {1} doesn''t assume those in charge are\
  \ evil - but {2} does assume they''re too distant to care what happens to people like {4}.

BLOODLUST.label=Thrives in Chaos
BLOODLUST.description.0.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just comfortable in chaotic battles - {2} lives for\
  \ them. When formations break, when plans crumble, when everything turns into an unpredictable\
  \ mess, that''s when {2}''s at {6} best. "You''re panicking? Relax. This is when things get fun."
BLOODLUST.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t freeze when things go sideways - {2} accelerates.\
  \ No hesitation, no second-guessing, just instinct and action. {5} {8} watches {4} make\
  \ reckless choices that somehow always pay off. "Stop overthinking. Just move."
BLOODLUST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just accept chaos - {2} expects it. {1}''s seen too\
  \ many battles fall apart, too many plans shatter on contact with reality. The ones who survive?\
  \ They''re the ones who stop trying to force order onto war and start embracing the madness.
BLOODLUST.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is at {6} absolute best when things are at their worst.\
  \ When deadlines stack up, when systems crash, when everyone else is panicking, {2}''s calmly\
  \ fixing six things at once. "Crisis? Nah, this is when I get stuff done."
BLOODLUST.description.1.SUPPORT={0} struggles with routine but flourishes under pressure. If\
  \ everything is calm and stable, {2} gets bored. But the moment things start falling apart, {2}\
  \ snaps into focus. "I swear, you only work properly when the whole system is burning down."\
  \ {0} grins. "Well, yeah."
BLOODLUST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched too many people break when their perfect plans\
  \ collapsed. {1} doesn''t believe in stability - {2} believes in adapting to the inevitable disaster.\
  \ {1} thrives in chaos because, to {4}, chaos is the only thing that''s ever truly reliable.

BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.label=Acts Bravely When Doubted
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t take doubt as criticism - {2} takes it as a\
  \ challenge. The second someone questions if {2} can handle a fight, {2} throws {4}self into it\
  \ headfirst. "Oh, you don''t think I can do it? Watch me."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1.COMBATANT=People assume {0}''s too brash, too impulsive - but every time\
  \ someone underestimates {4}, {2} rises to the occasion. {1} doesn''t just survive impossible\
  \ situations - {2} thrives in them. "I don''t need you to believe in me. I just need you to stay out\
  \ of my way."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} isn''t fearless - {2}''s terrified of being just another\
  \ warrior lost to history. {1} fights like {2} has something to prove, because if {2} doesn''t, then\
  \ what was the point? When someone doubts {4}, {2} takes it personally. "You think I won''t make\
  \ it? That''s fine. I''ll prove you wrong - or die trying."
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t seek the spotlight, doesn''t need to prove\
  \ {4}self - until someone implies {2}''s not up to the task. The moment someone says, "I don''t think\
  \ you can pull this off," {0} immediately sets out to do exactly that.
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} isn''t the loudest person in the room, but if someone\
  \ questions {6} competence, {2} won''t rest until {2} proves them wrong. "You said I couldn''t fix\
  \ this in time? Well, I just did. So what now?"
BRAVERY_IN_DOUBT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just fight for respect - {2} fights for recognition.\
  \ {1}''s seen what happens to the ones who blend into the background, the ones no one remembers\
  \ when the dust settles. If being doubted means pushing {4}self harder, then so be it. "You think\
  \ I can''t do it? Then I have to. Because otherwise, I''m nothing."

CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.label=Obsesses over Duels
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0.COMBATANT={0} can''t go five minutes without bringing up legendary\
  \ duels. "Yeah, yeah, battlefield tactics are fine, but have you see Molotov vs. Indigo? That was\
  \ real combat." {1} knows every famous match, every underdog story, every historic upset.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just watch duels - {2} models {6} entire combat\
  \ style after them. Flashy maneuvers, high-risk plays, individualist mentality - {2} fights like\
  \ {2}''s putting on a show, even in real warzones. "I don''t just want to win - I want them to\
  \ remember me."
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows real war is brutal, messy, and unfair. Arena \
  fights? They have rules, honor, a winner and a loser. {1} clings to the idea that somewhere,\
  \ there''s a version of combat where skill alone decides the outcome. Because if that''s not true,\
  \ then what''s the point of all of it?
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t talk about politics, history, or strategy - {2} talks\
  \ about the greatest arena fights of all time. {1} remembers them move for move, can analyze every\
  \ mistake, and treats duelist legends like war heroes.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter what''s happening, {0} finds a way to bring up arena\
  \ fights. "Oh, you think that''s impressive? You should''ve seen the time War Dog ran a one-legged\
  \ Thunderbolt to victory against Black Mamba" {1}''s that guy.
CLOSE_QUARTERS_ONLY.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows war is nothing like the arenas, but {2} wishes it\
  \ was. At least in the arenas, there''s a purpose, an end to the fight that isn''t just more\
  \ suffering. If {2} can''t fight in the arenas, at least {2} can dream about a world where war is\
  \ just entertainment instead of reality.

COOL_UNDER_FIRE.label=Remains Calm Under Fire
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.0.COMBATANT=Explosions, alarms, everything falling apart - {0} doesn''t even\
  \ flinch. While others are shouting, scrambling for cover, panicking, {2}''s coolly assessing the\
  \ situation. "Relax," {2} says, reloading like it''s just another drill. "If they were gonna kill\
  \ us, they''d have done it already."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.1.COMBATANT=When chaos erupts, {0} doesn''t freeze - {2} slows down. {1} reads\
  \ the battlefield, calculates options, and makes the right move without hesitation. Others act on\
  \ fear - {2} acts on certainty. "Breathe. Think. Then shoot."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t panic because {2} knows what real fear looks like.\
  \ {1}''s been through worse, lost too much, seen things {2} won''t talk about. Compared to that?\
  \ Incoming fire is just background noise.
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.0.SUPPORT=Systems crashing, power failures, emergency klaxons - {0}\
  \ doesn''t rush, doesn''t freak out. {1} keeps working, methodically solving the problem, while\
  \ others are losing their minds. "Panicking doesn''t fix anything," {2} mutters. "Let''s focus on\
  \ what will."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.1.SUPPORT=When the situation spirals out of control, {0} doesn''t add to\
  \ the noise - {2} cuts through it. {5} voice is steady, {6} hands don''t shake, and somehow, {6} calm\
  \ forces everyone else to settle down too. "One thing at a time," {2} says. "We get through this\
  \ like we always do."
COOL_UNDER_FIRE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too many situations turn disastrous because\
  \ everyone panicked at the wrong moment. {1} refuses to be that guy. If no one else can keep their\
  \ head, {2} will. Because if someone doesn''t stay calm, then no one makes it out.

CRASH_TEST.label=Purposely Tests Equipment Durability
CRASH_TEST.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just use {6} equipment - {2} abuses it. {1} pushes\
  \ everything past its rated limits, just to find out where they break. "If it fails now, that\
  \ means it would''ve failed in combat."
CRASH_TEST.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in manufacturer guarantees. {1} doesn''t\
  \ care what the specs say - {2} needs proof. So {2} pushes every piece of equipment past its redline,\
  \ just to make sure it holds up when it really matters. "If it survives me, it''ll survive a\
  \ battlefield."
CRASH_TEST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen the consequences of untested equipment failing\
  \ at the worst possible moment. A heat sink that should have handled the load, a weapon that\
  \ jammed when it mattered most. Now, {2} breaks things before battle - because if they fail in\
  \ testing, they won''t fail when lives are on the line.
CRASH_TEST.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just check if something works - {2} checks if it can\
  \ survive abuse. {1} runs systems hotter, pushes components harder, and doesn''t stop until\
  \ something fails spectacularly. "Oh, come on, it says it can handle this - so let''s find out."
CRASH_TEST.description.1.SUPPORT={0} refuses to sign off on anything until {2}''s personally\
  \ stress-tested it beyond reasonable limits. If a component is rated for ten tons of pressure,\
  \ {2}''s testing it at fifteen. If a system shouldn''t overheat, {2}''s finding out what temperature\
  \ actually kills it. "Better here than in the field."
CRASH_TEST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen people die because a system failed under real\
  \ conditions. {1} doesn''t trust any spec sheet - {2} only trusts what {2}''s tested {4}self. If that\
  \ means {2} destroys some gear in the process, so be it. It''s better than losing people because\
  \ someone trusted an untested number on a screen.

DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.label=Uses Deadpan Humor
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a knack for perfectly-timed, emotionless one-liners.\
  \ Explosions in the distance? "Well, that sounds promising." Half {6} {8} wiped out? "Guess\
  \ it''s my turn, then." It''s never clear if {2}''s joking, but it definitely helps break the tension.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t panic - {2} makes a dry remark and keeps moving.\
  \ "We''re outnumbered ten to one." {0} nods. "Oh good, that''s an even fight." {5} {8} isn''t\
  \ sure if {2}''s fearless or just too dead inside to care anymore.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} cracks emotionless jokes because if {2} stopped to process\
  \ everything, it might actually get to {4}. It''s easier to act like it''s all just a mildly\
  \ inconvenient joke than admit just how close they all are to dying at any given moment.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s reports always start with something grim. "Well,\
  \ everything''s broken, we''re running on fumes, and I assume command has already planned our\
  \ funerals." Pause. "Anyway, I patched the issue. It should be fine."
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.1.SUPPORT=Emergency meeting? {0}''s there with a straight face. "Oh,\
  \ don''t worry. We''re only mildly doomed." No one''s sure if {2}''s joking. {1} never clarifies.
DEAD_PAN_HUMOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t laugh because nothing is actually funny anymore.\
  \ But if {2} doesn''t make some kind of joke, then all that''s left is the weight of everything\
  \ falling apart around {4}. So instead, {2} keeps {6} voice flat, {6} delivery emotionless, and\
  \ {6} humor just dark enough to keep everyone uneasy.

DRILLS.label=Obsessed with Drills and Simulations
DRILLS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} treats every drill like it''s life or death - because one\
  \ day, it will be. {1} runs combat sims until {6} {8} hates {4} for it. "You think this is\
  \ excessive?" {2} asks, dead serious. "Tell me that after we survive the real thing."
DRILLS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} lives for simulations. {1} has counter-strategies for\
  \ everything, from basic ambushes to hypothetical enemy maneuvers no one else has ever\
  \ considered. "It''s not paranoia," {2} says. "It''s being ready."
DRILLS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched warriors die because they froze up, made a\
  \ bad call, or simply weren''t prepared. Now, {2} drills relentlessly - because if {2} can burn\
  \ survival into muscle memory, maybe {2} can save at least a few of them next time.
DRILLS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} runs drills for everything - from emergency evacuations to\
  \ what to do if a DropShip crash-lands on HQ. {5} colleagues groan, but {2} doesn''t care. "When it\
  \ actually happens, you''ll thank me."
DRILLS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust any system, plan, or procedure unless it''s\
  \ been tested to the breaking point. "If we haven''t drilled it under pressure, then we don''t know\
  \ if it actually works." And if that means running another sim? Then they''re running another sim.
DRILLS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen people die because they hesitated. Because they\
  \ didn''t know what to do fast enough. {1} drills everything because in the moment, there''s no time\
  \ to think - there''s just reacting right, or dying fast.

ENEMY_RESPECT.label=Respects Worthy Enemies
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hate {6} enemies - {2} studies them. If someone\
  \ fights well, if they make the right calls, if they push {4} to {6} limits, {2} remembers them.\
  \ "That guy? They''re good. Next time, I''ll have to be better."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.1.COMBATANT=When {0} faces an enemy that truly challenges {4}, {2}\
  \ thrives. {1} doesn''t just fight to win - {2} fights to prove {4}self. "No tricks, no gimmicks - just\
  \ skill. Let''s see who walks away."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows war is ugly, merciless, brutal. But when {2} finds\
  \ an enemy who fights with skill, honor, and intelligence, {2} acknowledges them. Because if\
  \ there''s nothing but slaughter and chaos, then what''s the point of fighting at all?
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just track enemy movements - {2} analyzes them like\
  \ an art form. If an opposing force executes a brilliant maneuver, {2}''s the first to point it\
  \ out. "That was genius. Annoying, but genius."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t dismiss enemy forces as just another threat. If\
  \ they''re skilled, if they earn {6} respect, {2} talks about them like they''re part of the game.\
  \ "That commander? If they were on our side, we''d never lose."
ENEMY_RESPECT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t respect every enemy - just the ones who fight with\
  \ honor. Because {2}''s seen the other kind - the ones who kill without reason, without restraint.\
  \ Against them? There''s no respect. Only destruction.

EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.label=Extremely Morning-Oriented
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is up before dawn, already running drills while the rest\
  \ of the {8} is barely conscious. "Morning is when the real soldiers prepare," {2} says, sipping\
  \ a steaming-hot cup of coffee while everyone else groans.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.1.COMBATANT=By the time others are starting their first briefing, {0} has\
  \ already run a full systems check, a workout, and possibly a simulated battle. "I''ve been\
  \ productive for hours," {2} grins, as someone else mumbles, "It''s literally 0500."
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just wake up early - {2} needs to. {1}''s seen too\
  \ many people go to sleep and never wake up again. {1} refuses to waste a single morning, because\
  \ every sunrise might be the last one {2} sees.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is already deep into work before anyone else even stumbles\

EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.1.SUPPORT={0} does not tolerate sluggish morning energy. If someone''s\

  \ wouldn''t be struggling with this." {1} says this while effortlessly handling three tasks at once.
EXTREME_MORNING_PERSON.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s body refuses to let {4} sleep past dawn. Years of\
  \ training, of near-death moments in the dark, of knowing that the ones who hesitate die first,\
  \ have burned it into {4}. {1} wakes up before the danger does, because that''s what''s kept {4}\
  \ alive so far.

GALLANT.label=Gallant in Battle
GALLANT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} fights with style. Whether it''s a\
  \ dramatic duel, a well-timed flourish, or a perfectly executed maneuver, {2} makes battle look\
  \ good. "If you''re going to fight," {2} grins, dodging incoming fire, "you might as well make it\
  \ memorable."
GALLANT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} refuses to abandon {6} {8}, even when it means putting\
  \ {4}self in danger. {1}''s the one diving into enemy fire to pull a comrade out, the one holding\
  \ the line so others can escape. "You go," {2} says, standing firm. "I''ll make sure they don''t\
  \ follow you."
GALLANT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} fights with honor because {2} refuses to become just\
  \ another killer. {1}''s seen what war does to people - how it turns them into cold, brutal\
  \ survivors. If {2}''s going to fight, {2}''ll do it {6} way - with courage, with dignity, and with the\
  \ hope that it still matters.
GALLANT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} approaches every task like {2}''s leading a charge. Whether\
  \ {2}''s repairing a system or handling logistics, {2} does it with the same pride and confidence as\
  \ if {2} were on the front lines. "Not all heroes wear coolant vests," {2} smirks, adjusting {6}\
  \ gloves.
GALLANT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never hesitates to step up when someone needs help. If\
  \ there''s a problem, {2}''s handling it, if someone''s struggling, {2}''s lifting them up. {1} makes\
  \ sure everyone succeeds - not just {4}self. "You don''t leave your people behind," {2} says simply.
GALLANT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched too many people lose themselves to war. {1}\
  \ refuses to let that happen to {4}. No matter how bad things get, no matter how much {2}''s lost,\
  \ {2} still stands tall, unshaken, and unbroken. If {2} has to fight, {2}''ll do it with dignity.

IRON_STOMACH.label=Can Eat Anything
IRON_STOMACH.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has zero food standards. Expired rations? Still good.\
  \ Field scavenged supplies? Edible. Some questionable protein paste found in a destroyed base?\
  \ "If it doesn''t kill me, it''s food." {5} {8} is horrified - {2} doesn''t even hesitate before\
  \ taking a bite.
IRON_STOMACH.description.1.COMBATANT={0} eats for survival, not pleasure. {1}''ll consume anything\
  \ that keeps {4} moving, from high-energy nutrient bricks to mysterious battlefield leftovers.\
  \ "Food is fuel," {2} shrugs, gnawing on something vaguely resembling jerky. "Doesn''t matter what\
  \ it is as long as it works."
IRON_STOMACH.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t complain about food because {2}''s been through\
  \ worse. {1}''s starved before. {1}''s had weeks where meals weren''t an option. So if it''s even\
  \ remotely edible, {2} eats it - because {2} knows what it''s like when there''s nothing left to eat at\
  \ all.
IRON_STOMACH.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t care if the meal is burned, over-processed, or\
  \ unidentifiable. If it''s served, {2}''s eating it. "Oh, that''s the bad batch?" {2} asks, taking a\
  \ bite anyway. "Tastes fine to me."
IRON_STOMACH.description.1.SUPPORT={0} eats whatever is fastest, cheapest, or most available.\
  \ Nutrient paste, expired protein bars, mystery leftovers from two days ago - {2}''s completely\
  \ unbothered. "You''re picky about food? Must be nice."
IRON_STOMACH.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t waste time worrying about taste because {2}''s seen\
  \ people die on an empty stomach. {1} eats whatever''s there because, in war, food is just another\
  \ resource - and running out of it can mean the difference between life and death.

MISSION_CRITIC.label=Hyper-Critical of Mission Plans
MISSION_CRITIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just hear a mission briefing - {2} dissects it.\
  \ Before command even finishes talking, {2}''s already identified every weak point, every flaw, and\
  \ every way it could get people killed. "Yeah, okay, but what happens when this part fails?\
  \ Because it will fail."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just trust a plan because it came from higher up\
  \ the chain. {1} needs to see it work. If {2}''s not convinced, {2}''ll grill leadership until they\
  \ either justify it or fix it. "I''m not running a mission just because someone in a suit thinks\
  \ it should work."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to trust mission briefings - until {2} saw too many bad\
  \ calls end in disaster. Now, {2} refuses to blindly follow anything. If a plan isn''t bulletproof,\
  \ {2}''s going to tear it apart - because in war, the ones who don''t question bad plans end up dead.
MISSION_CRITIC.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t trying to be difficult - {2} just refuses to accept\
  \ half-baked plans. If there''s a flaw, {2} will find it, and {2} will point it out. "Oh, so we''re\
  \ just assuming supply lines hold? Yeah, that''s gonna go great."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} believes every strategy should be tested, retested, and\
  \ stress-tested again. If something isn''t solid, {2}''s stopping everything until it is. "Look, you\
  \ can go with this version, or you can go with the one that actually works."
MISSION_CRITIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too many missions fail because someone didn''t ask\
  \ enough questions. {1} doesn''t criticize plans for fun - {2} does it because {2} knows that bad\
  \ planning kills just as effectively as enemy fire. And {2} refuses to be part of another botched\
  \ operation that leaves people dead for no reason.

NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.label=Believes in "No Pain, No Gain"
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in taking it easy. Every drill, every\
  \ mission, every battle - {2} pushes {4}self past the limit, convinced that if it doesn''t hurt, it\
  \ doesn''t count. "You''re sore? Good. That means you''re improving."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1.COMBATANT=To {0}, pain isn''t a problem - it''s proof {2}''s still alive. {1}\
  \ doesn''t back down from grueling conditions, punishing training, or even injuries. "Hurts? Yeah,\
  \ it''s supposed to. If you want to be better, you learn to live with it."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what happens to soldiers who hesitate when\
  \ things get rough. {1} doesn''t believe in comfort, in taking it slow, in waiting until conditions\
  \ are right. War doesn''t care if you''re hurting. Either you push through it, or you die.
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust easy solutions. If something isn''t a\
  \ challenge, {2} assumes it''s not actually helping {4} improve. "If it doesn''t make you sweat,\
  \ it''s not worth doing."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in shortcuts, doesn''t sympathize with\
  \ complaints, and thinks everyone should be pushing themselves harder. If someone grumbles about\
  \ a tough job, {2} just smirks. "You want an easy life? You picked the wrong line of work."
NO_PAIN_NO_GAIN.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched people break because they weren''t ready to\
  \ endure real hardship. {1}''s seen them fail when things got too rough, collapse when the pressure\
  \ hit. {1} refuses to be one of them. Pain isn''t just necessary - it''s the price of survival.

PERSONAL_ARMORY.label=Keeps a Personal Armory
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just have weapons - {2} collects them. Laser\
  \ rifles, old ballistics, experimental prototypes - {6} quarters look like a personal weapons\
  \ depot. "You say ''overkill,'' I say ''being prepared for any situation.''"
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust standard-issue gear - {2} prefers {6} own\
  \ meticulously maintained, custom-modified weapons. Each one has a purpose, a history, and a\
  \ reason for being in {6} collection. "Command says ''stick to regs.'' Command can borrow my\
  \ backups when theirs fail."
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hoard weapons for fun - {2} does it because {2}''s\
  \ seen what happens when people are caught unprepared. {1}''s not going to be the one scrambling\
  \ for a weapon when everything falls apart. If the war comes to {4}, {2}''s ready for it.
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.0.SUPPORT={0} may not be frontline, but {2} sure acts like it. {1} keeps\
  \ an entire stockpile of sidearms, knives, and probably some heavy weapons in places they\
  \ absolutely shouldn''t be. "What? You don''t have a contingency stash?"
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t think being support staff means being unarmed.\
  \ {1}''s got sidearms stashed in toolkits, a shotgun behind a supply crate, and at least one\
  \ knife strapped somewhere no one expects. "Look, I don''t plan for things to go south - I just make\
  \ sure when they do, I''m still standing."
PERSONAL_ARMORY.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in the idea of ''safe zones.'' {1}''s seen\
  \ support staff get wiped out, seen people die reaching for weapons they didn''t have. {1} refuses\
  \ to be helpless when the fighting reaches {4}. If war comes, {2}''s bringing {6} own guns to the fight.

QUICK_ADAPTER.label=Adapts Quickly to New Situations
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t freeze when things go sideways - {2} adjusts\
  \ instantly. Enemy reinforcements? {1}''s already repositioning. Equipment failure? {1}''s switching\
  \ tactics mid-fight. "You think sticking to the plan is smart? Plans get you killed. Adapting\
  \ keeps you alive."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t panic when things don''t go according to mission\
  \ briefings. {1} expects things to shift, anticipates sudden changes, and adjusts faster than the\
  \ enemy does. "They changed their tactics? Good. That means I get to change mine too."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t have the luxury of overthinking. {1}''s watched\
  \ soldiers die because they froze for just a second too long. If a situation shifts, {2} moves\
  \ first, thinks second. Because the ones who wait? They don''t make it.
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t panic when systems fail, supplies run out, or\
  \ schedules fall apart. {1} immediately finds a workaround, fixes the problem, and moves on like\
  \ it was never an issue. "Oh, the entire system crashed? Give me five minutes."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.1.SUPPORT=New tech, new protocols, new disasters - {0} absorbs them all\
  \ instantly. {1} doesn''t dwell on how things were done before - {2} just adapts. "The system changed\
  \ again? Cool. I already figured it out."
QUICK_ADAPTER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust stability. {1}''s seen entire operations fall\
  \ apart in seconds. {1} knows the ones who survive aren''t the strongest or the smartest - they''re\
  \ the ones who change first. Because if you can''t keep up, you''re already falling behind.

RETALIATOR.label=Seeks Revenge for Any Slight
RETALIATOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just let things go. If an enemy targets {4},\
  \ shoots in {6} direction, or even looks at {4} the wrong way, {2}''s making damn sure they regret\
  \ it. "You scratched my armor? Bad move. Now you''re my problem."
RETALIATOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} remembers every slight - every ambush, every dirty trick,\
  \ every insult over open comms. And {2} doesn''t just get even - {2} makes sure whoever wronged {4}\
  \ never forgets it. "You thought I''d forget what you did? That''s adorable."
RETALIATOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in forgiveness in war. If someone gets\
  \ away with hurting {4} or {6} {8}, it means they think they can do it again. {1} will track\
  \ them down. {1} will make it right. Because if {2} doesn''t? Then what''s the point of fighting at\
  \ all?
RETALIATOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} may not start conflicts, but {2} never lets them go. If\
  \ someone questions {6} work, mocks {6} methods, or even slightly disrespects {4}, {2}''s keeping a\
  \ mental file on them forever. "Oh, you thought that snide comment wasn''t going to have\
  \ consequences? Cute."
RETALIATOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s revenge isn''t loud - it''s calculated. Delayed requisition\
  \ forms, conveniently missing supplies, small but infuriating inconveniences. {1} doesn''t lash\
  \ out - {2} waits, plans, and strikes when it''s most effective.
RETALIATOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} can''t let slights go, because {2} knows that if {2} does, it\
  \ sets a precedent. If people think they can walk over {4}, they will. So {2} makes sure every\
  \ slight is paid back - because in this world, respect is only given to those who take it by force.

RUSH_HOUR.label=Enjoys the Rush of a Crisis
RUSH_HOUR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just handle chaotic situations - {2} thrives in\
  \ them. When the battle turns into a full-blown disaster, {2}''s grinning, moving faster, thinking\
  \ sharper. "Oh, now we''re really playing," {2} says, dodging incoming fire like it''s just another\
  \ drill.
RUSH_HOUR.description.1.COMBATANT=The more desperate the fight, the more focused {0} becomes.\
  \ {1} doesn''t care about calm, controlled engagements - {2} wants last stands, desperate charges,\
  \ impossible odds. "You call this a crisis? I call it a challenge."
RUSH_HOUR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just enjoy the rush - {2} needs it. In the quiet\
  \ moments, {6} hands shake, {6} mind won''t stop racing. But when the crisis hits? {1}''s steady,\
  \ clear, unbreakable. Because if {2}''s not in danger, {2}''s not sure who {2} even is anymore.
RUSH_HOUR.description.0.SUPPORT=When everything is falling apart, {0} isn''t panicking - {2}''s\
  \ energized. {1}''s fixing systems, rerouting power, barking orders like {2}''s been waiting for\
  \ this. "Oh no, a total systems meltdown? Finally, something interesting."
RUSH_HOUR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t cause problems, but when things are too quiet, {2}\
  \ gets restless. When a crisis does hit, {2} jumps in with way too much enthusiasm. "Catastrophic\
  \ failure? Yeah, okay, let''s go!"
RUSH_HOUR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t enjoy disaster, but it''s the only time people need\
  \ {4}, listen to {4}, rely on {4}. When things are calm, {2} feels irrelevant. But in a crisis?\
  \ That''s when {2}''s truly alive.

SILENT_PROTECTOR.label=Protects Allies Silently
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT=Without Ever Saying It Out Loud) - {0} doesn''t make a big\
  \ deal about watching over {6} team - {2} just does it. Covering flanks, blocking shots, dragging a\
  \ wounded ally to safety - {2} never talks about it. "Just keep moving," {2} mutters, holding the\
  \ line without expecting thanks.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} won''t give speeches about teamwork, loyalty, or honor.\
  \ But when things go bad, {2}''s the one putting {4}self between the danger and {6} friends. {1}''ll\
  \ take hits, hold positions, and sacrifice {6} advantage just to keep others alive. "Don''t worry\
  \ about me. Just finish the job."
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen too many people get left behind. {1} won''t let it\
  \ happen again. If {6} {8} is in trouble, {2}''s already moving to cover them. Because if someone\
  \ has to take the risk, it''ll be {4} - every time.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t announce what {2}''s doing - {2} just quietly makes\
  \ sure things go right. If a system is failing, if supplies are running low, if someone needs\
  \ help, {2}''s already handling it before they know to ask.
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t expect thanks, doesn''t make a scene, doesn''t draw\
  \ attention. If someone''s struggling, {2} quietly covers for them. If a mistake needs fixing, {2}\
  \ corrects it before anyone notices. "No need to mention it. Just... try not to screw up next time."
SILENT_PROTECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t everyone else first for praise - {2} does it because\
  \ {2} knows how easy it is for people to fall through the cracks. If someone has to keep things\
  \ from spiraling out of control, it might as well be {4}.

ALWAYS_TACTICAL.label=Always Thinking Tactically
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just react - {2} anticipates. {1}''s analyzing enemy\
  \ movements, tracking supply positions, and adjusting for terrain advantages before {6} {8}\
  \ even realizes the fight has shifted. "They''re moving left. Cut them off at that ridge in three\
  \ seconds."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.1.COMBATANT={0} fights efficiently, wasting zero movements, always\
  \ predicting the next step. If something looks like luck, it''s actually precision. "You think\
  \ that was instinct? No. That was reading the field before it happened."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t get lost in the fight - {2} controls it. {1}''s seen\
  \ how quickly things spiral when people stop thinking and start reacting blindly. War isn''t just\
  \ brutality - it''s a series of calculations with life-or-death stakes.
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.0.SUPPORT={0} sees everything as a tactical problem to be solved. Supply\
  \ chains? Personnel assignments? Resource management? "You don''t win wars with guns alone. You\
  \ win them by out-thinking the enemy before the first shot is fired."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just solve current problems - {2}''s already planning\
  \ for what comes next. If someone suggests a course of action, {2}''s already identified the\
  \ weaknesses and alternatives. "Good plan. Now tell me what happens when it goes wrong."
ALWAYS_TACTICAL.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in luck or optimism. {1}''s seen too many\
  \ brilliant strategies collapse because no one thought about contingencies. {1} strategizes\
  \ relentlessly, because in war, the best plans are the ones that don''t get you killed when they\
  \ fail.

BATTLE_SCREAM.label=Uses a Battle Scream
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t fight in silence - {2} fights with pure, raw energy.\
  \ Whether it''s charging headfirst into combat or firing a devastating salvo, {2} lets out a\
  \ gut-wrenching, primal scream. "If you''re not shouting, you''re not really in the fight!"
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s battle scream isn''t just noise - it''s a weapon. It\
  \ rattles the enemy, it fires up {6} {8}, and it drowns out everything else. Pain, fear,\
  \ exhaustion? Gone. "When you hear me scream, you follow me in, or you get out of my damn way!"
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t roar in battle for show - {2} roars because it''s\
  \ the only way to drown out the horror of war. The burning wrecks, the dying voices, the sheer\
  \ chaos - it all disappears under {6} own voice. Because if {2} stops screaming, {2} might actually\
  \ hear what''s happening around {4}.
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just work - {2} fights against every stubborn system,\
  \ every failing mechanism. When something won''t budge, when a panel won''t come loose, when a\
  \ machine resists? Cue the war cry. "YOU. WILL. WORK." Metal groans. Problem solved.
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.1.SUPPORT=If things get tense, {0} doesn''t calmly handle it - {2} lets out\
  \ a full battle scream before diving in. Emergency alarms blaring? Scream. Major system failure?\
  \ Scream. Even a minor inconvenience? Possibly still a scream. "It''s fine! Just psyching myself\
  \ up!"
BATTLE_SCREAM.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t talk about stress. {1} doesn''t vent. {1} bottles it\
  \ all up - until it comes out as a piercing, primal battle scream when things reach a breaking\
  \ point. {1} laughs it off after. "All good now." But is it? Is it really?

BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.label=Brief and To the Point
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t waste breath in combat. Orders, reports,\
  \ warnings - they''re all short, direct, and immediate. "Move left." "Enemy incoming." "Cover me."\
  \ No extra words. No wasted time.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t explain things - {2} just does them. If someone asks\
  \ for a plan, {2} gives a three-word response. "We win. Let''s go." Anything beyond that?\
  \ Unnecessary.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in long-winded speeches. War doesn''t care\
  \ about words. If {2} speaks, it''s because something needs to be said. And if it doesn''t? {1} stays\
  \ silent and keeps moving.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t explain things when people should already know\
  \ them. Reports? Minimalist. Memos? One sentence. If someone asks a long-winded question, they\
  \ get a one-word answer.
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} believes meetings should last five minutes, not an hour.\
  \ If there''s a problem, {2} gives the shortest possible fix and moves on. "Problem?" Fixes it.\
  \ "Next?"
BRIEF_AND_TO_THE_POINT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched people die because someone took too long\
  \ explaining something. {1}''s learned that fewer words, faster action means better odds of\
  \ survival. If {2} doesn''t need to say it, {2} doesn''t.

CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.label=Collects Callsigns
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just hear callsigns - {2} remembers them. Every\
  \ hero, every ace, every fallen comrade - {2} keeps a mental log. "Stormbringer? Yeah, I fought\
  \ against them once. Tough bastard. Still out there?"
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} insists on giving people callsigns, even if they don''t\
  \ want one. If you fight with {4}, you earn a name, and {2}''ll make sure it sticks. "Nah, you\
  \ don''t get to be ''just Jones.'' You''re ''Trouser Snake'' now."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t keep a list for fun - {2} keeps it because so many\
  \ are gone now. Callsigns are all that''s left of them, and if {2} doesn''t remember them, who will?\
  \ "{7}r. Coldsteel. Widowmaker. They fought. They mattered. I won''t forget."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just handle logistics - {2} documents every pilot,\
  \ every unit, every alias. If you have a callsign, {2} knows it, remembers it, and probably has\
  \ notes on it. "Oh yeah, you fought with Iron Fang last year, right? Heard good things."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} rarely remembers real names, but if you give {4} a\
  \ callsign? {1}''ll never forget it. "Who''s ''Captain Reynolds''? No clue. Who''s ''Gravedigger''? Yeah,\
  \ I know exactly who that is."
CALLSIGN_COLLECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} writes down every name, every alias, every legend. {1}\
  \ knows too many people disappear in this war - vanish from the records, lost to time. {1} refuses\
  \ to let that happen. If {2} has to be the last one who remembers, so be it.

CHATTERBOX.label=Constant Chatterbox
CHATTERBOX.description.0.COMBATANT={0} is constantly narrating, cracking jokes, and running\
  \ commentary, even when dodging enemy fire. "Oh great, another missile lock - real original, guys!"\
  \ {5} {8} has learned to tune {4} out or roll with it.
CHATTERBOX.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never shuts up. {1}''s talking tactics, reliving old\
  \ fights, or just going on about something unrelated mid-firefight. "You ever wonder if our\
  \ DropShips are just really expensive coffins? No? Just me? Cool."
CHATTERBOX.description.2.COMBATANT={0} fills the silence because silence means thinking. And\
  \ thinking means remembering. And remembering means realizing how bad things really are. So\
  \ instead, {2} just keeps talking. About anything. Because if {2} stops, what''s left?
CHATTERBOX.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just work - {2} talks through the process. "Okay, so\
  \ now we recalibrate the system - oh wow, this is a mess, who even installed this? - anyway, now we\
  \ just... and boom, fixed it."
CHATTERBOX.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t need an audience to talk - {2}''s perfectly fine\
  \ talking to {4}self. But if someone is nearby? Even better. "Did you know that if this system\
  \ fails, we all die horribly? Just saying. Anyway, how''s your day?"
CHATTERBOX.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows what it means when people stop talking. It means\
  \ they''re tired, broken, or already lost. {1} refuses to let that happen to {4}self - or anyone\

COMBAT_ARTIST.label=Combat as Art Form
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} creates. Every shot, every\
  \ maneuver, every strike is deliberate, practiced, and flawless. "Anyone can pull a trigger. A\
  \ real warrior makes it look good."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just survive battles - {2} flows through them,\
  \ treating combat like a perfectly choreographed dance. Every step, every feint, every\
  \ counterattack is fluid, seamless, and effortless. "War isn''t just about winning - it''s about how\
  \ you win."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t fight like a brute, because {2} refuses to believe\
  \ war is just violence for violence''s sake. If {2} doesn''t turn it into something greater, into\
  \ art, then what is it? Just murder. And {2} can''t let {4}self believe that''s all there is.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just see war as strategy - {2} sees it as expression.\
  \ {1} studies legendary duels, dissects perfect maneuvers, and talks about battles like they\
  \ belong in a museum. "That last engagement? Pure artistry. You don''t just see skill like that\
  \ every day."
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.1.SUPPORT={0} applies {6} artistic philosophy to everything. If\
  \ something isn''t precise, efficient, and elegant, {2} disapproves.
COMBAT_ARTIST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} romanticizes war because {2} has to. If {2} lets {4}self see\
  \ it as just blood, destruction, and suffering, {2} might not be able to justify {6} role in it\
  \ anymore. So instead, {2} sees it as a craft, an art, something worth perfecting. Because if war\

DARING_ESCAPE.label=Specializes in Daring Escapes
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just retreat - {2} orchestrates an escape with\
  \ flair. Smoke, misdirection, last-second maneuvers - {2} turns what should be a desperate flight\
  \ into something that looks almost effortless. "You call it running. I call it leaving\
  \ dramatically."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1.COMBATANT=When things go south, {0}''s already two steps ahead. {1}''s the\
  \ one who finds the overlooked exit, or improvises a crazy plan that somehow works. "There''s\
  \ always a way out. You just have to be willing to take it."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t escape because {2}''s afraid - {2} does it because\
  \ {2}''s seen what happens when people refuse to retreat. {1}''s learned that sometimes, the\
  \ difference between living and dying is knowing when to run. And {2} never hesitates when that\
  \ time comes.
DARING_ESCAPE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust any situation to stay safe for long. {1}''s\
  \ got emergency exit routes mapped, contingency plans in place, and a go-bag ready at all times.\
  \ "You laugh now, but when everything goes to hell, I''ll be the one getting out alive."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has an uncanny ability to disappear from dangerous,\
  \ awkward, or annoying situations. {1}''s the first one to duck out of a failing meeting, the one\
  \ who always finds the shortest line, the best exit, the quickest solution. "I don''t run. I\
  \ strategically disengage."
DARING_ESCAPE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t wait for rescue, doesn''t trust that someone will\
  \ come for {4}. {1}''s seen too many people left behind, too many desperate last stands that led\
  \ nowhere. So {2} makes sure {2} always has a way out. Because in war, survivors aren''t always the\
  \ best fighters - they''re the best escape artists.

DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.label=Doomsday Prepper
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just prepare for combat - {2} prepares for\
  \ everything. EMP strikes, total infrastructure collapse, a sudden rebellion - {2} has plans for all\
  \ of it. "Laugh all you want, but when the comms go dark and the supply lines fail, I''ll be the\
  \ one still standing."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.1.COMBATANT={0}''s has extra rations, fuel reserves, emergency power\
  \ cells, and a dozen weapons that aren''t standard issue. {1} doesn''t just fight battles - {2}\
  \ prepares to outlast wars. "You rely on logistics. I rely on myself."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} stockpiles and prepares because {2} knows that wars don''t\
  \ end when people say they do. {1}''s seen entire units abandoned, vehicles left to rot, warriors\
  \ forgotten by their own commanders. If everything collapses, {2} will not be one of the ones\
  \ left to die in the ruins.
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust any system to work forever. {1} has redundant\
  \ power sources, hidden supply caches, and a list of fallback plans that leadership doesn''t even\
  \ know about. "Oh, the main reactor failed? Good thing I stashed a spare energy cell where no one\
  \ thought to look."
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has hidden stockpiles everywhere. Rations in the storage\
  \ bay, extra weapons in unmarked crates, an escape route planned for any disaster. People think\
  \ {2}''s paranoid - until the first real crisis hits. "What do you mean you didn''t pack three months''\
  \ worth of emergency food?"
DOOMSDAY_PREPPER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} prepares not because {2} expects help, but because {2}''s\
  \ learned that help doesn''t come. {1}''s seen entire outposts abandoned, warriors cut off and left\
  \ to fend for themselves. {1} will never let {4}self be that vulnerable again. If the world ends\
  \ tomorrow? {1}''s ready.

EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.label=Scavenges for Gear
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} loots. Every battle is a chance to\
  \ pick up better weapons, spare armor, or rare tech. If it''s not nailed down, {2}''s already\
  \ figuring out how to use it. "Waste not, want not. That guy''s not using {6} boots anymore, so I\
  \ will."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t rely on supply chains. {1}''s patched together\
  \ weapons from three different manufacturers, repurposed enemy tech, and turned scrap into\
  \ survival tools. "You trust requisitions. I trust whatever I can pull off a wrecked war machine."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has run dry before - been left without ammo, without\
  \ working equipment, without a damn chance. Now, {2} picks up everything {2} can, because {2} knows\
  \ the day will come when no one is resupplying {4}. And when that day comes? {1}''ll be the only\
  \ one still armed.
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} hoards spare parts, salvages damaged equipment, and can\
  \ fix a system using components that no one else thought were worth keeping. "You were gonna\
  \ throw this away? I just made it fully operational again."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has stashes everywhere. A forgotten crate of munitions, a\
  \ backup power cell, a nearly functional enemy targeting system {2} ''acquired''. When things go\
  \ wrong, {2} has what''s needed. "Oh, now you need the part I ''shouldn''t have taken''? Funny how\
  \ that works."
EQUIPMENT_SCAVENGER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t scavenge for fun - {2} does it because {2} knows\
  \ supplies don''t last forever. {1}''s seen bases stripped bare, troops left defenseless, entire\
  \ operations collapse because no one had the foresight to keep extras. If war means fighting with\
  \ scraps, then {2}''s making sure {2} has the best scraps available.

FRIEND_TO_FOES.label=Sympathetic to Enemies
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t fight with hatred - {2} fights because {2} has to. {1}\
  \ recognizes that the people on the other side aren''t so different from {4}. "They''ve got orders.\
  \ We''ve got orders. The difference is who''s left standing at the end."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1.COMBATANT={0} isn''t the type to shoot a retreating enemy, nor does {2}\
  \ take pleasure in victory. {1} fights only as much as necessary. "Not every enemy deserves to\
  \ die. Some of them are just trying to survive - same as us."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2.COMBATANT={0} understands that war is politics, not personal. If things\
  \ had played out just a little differently, {2} might have been wearing their colors, following\
  \ their orders, killing {6} own people. That thought haunts {4} every time {2} pulls the trigger.
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.0.SUPPORT={0} studies enemy tactics, but not just for strategic\
  \ reasons - {2} wants to understand them. Their history, their motivations, their art. "You to beat\
  \ them? Try understanding why they''re fighting in the first place."
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t see war as black and white. {1} believes that if\
  \ things changed, if people actually listened instead of just fighting endlessly, maybe they\
  \ wouldn''t have to be enemies forever. "We''ve fought with worse people than them before. Who says\
  \ that can''t change?"
FRIEND_TO_FOES.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in good guys and bad guys anymore. {1}''s\
  \ seen leaders give orders that waste lives like they mean nothing. {1} knows the ones dying in\
  \ the scrum - on both sides - are just pawns in someone else''s war. And that realization is hard to\
  \ ignore.

GUNG_HO.label=Gung-Ho Attitude
GUNG_HO.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t wait for perfect conditions - {2} dives in\
  \ headfirst. While others are weighing options, {2}''s already moving. "Sitting around won''t win\
  \ this fight - hitting them first will!"
GUNG_HO.description.1.COMBATANT={0} thrives in the chaos of war, treating every mission as a\
  \ personal challenge. The more dangerous the objective, the bigger {6} grin. "Oh, this is a bad\
  \ idea? Good. That makes it more fun."
GUNG_HO.description.2.COMBATANT={0} pushes forward relentlessly, not just because {2} enjoys\
  \ combat, but because slowing down means thinking. And thinking means acknowledging just how much\
  \ this war has taken from {4}.
GUNG_HO.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t hesitate - {2} just acts. System failure? {1}''s on it\
  \ before anyone finishes panicking. Major logistical issue? Already moving to fix it. "Less\
  \ talking, more doing."
GUNG_HO.description.1.SUPPORT={0} takes on every task with full force. If there''s a problem,\
  \ it''s not an obstacle - it''s a battle to be won. {1} refuses to approach any situation\
  \ half-heartedly.
GUNG_HO.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t stop moving because stopping means facing reality.\
  \ If {2} keeps acting like every moment is a fight, then {2} never has to process the nagging\
  \ thought that none of it will ever change.

INSPIRATIONAL_POET.label=Gives Inspirational Speeches
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just talk - {2} commands attention. Before a battle,\
  \ after a crushing loss, in the middle of a desperate fight, {2} speaks with a fire that makes\
  \ others believe they can win. "We aren''t done yet. We never will be. Not until this fight is\
  \ ours."
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t let fear or doubt take hold - not on {6} watch.\
  \ When morale is at its lowest, when the enemy seems unstoppable, {2} stands tall, spitting\
  \ defiance in the face of despair. "They want us to quit. They think we''ll break. But I say we\
  \ show them what happens when you push us too far."
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in blind optimism, but {2}''s seen what\
  \ happens when soldiers lose hope. {1} speaks because someone has to, because if {2} doesn''t, then\
  \ this war will swallow them whole before the next shot is even fired.
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just there to do {6} job - {2} holds people together.\
  \ When shifts get long, when the odds seem impossible, {2}''s the one reminding everyone why they\
  \ keep going.
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.1.SUPPORT={0} can make anything feel important and {2} makes sure\
  \ everyone knows that their work matters. "You think this is small? Nothing is small in war. The\
  \ moment we forget that is the moment we start losing."
INSPIRATIONAL_POET.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t naturally optimistic, but {2} knows what happens when\
  \ people stop believing they can win. {1} talks, {2} inspires, because if {2} doesn''t keep morale\
  \ up, then sooner or later, people will stop trying at all.

MEK_MATCHMAKER.label=Believes in ''Mek Compatibility
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t care about technical readouts or factory\
  \ settings - {2} knows when a unit feels right. If {2}''s forced into something that doesn''t match\
  \ {4}, {2} feels it immediately. "You don''t pick a machine based on numbers. You feel which one\
  \ belongs to you."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} can''t fully prove {6} belief in machine compatibility, but\
  \ {2} knows it''s real. {1}''s seen people fight like legends in one machine, then struggle in\
  \ another. "Call it superstition if you want. All I know is, when you find your ride, everything\
  \ just works."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched people fail catastrophically in machines that\
  \ didn''t fit them, seen them hesitate for half a second too long because they weren''t in sync. {1}\
  \ refuses to make that mistake. "The wrong machine will kill you faster than the enemy ever could."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t think anyone can just step into any machine and\
  \ perform the same way. {1}''s seen too many people struggle for no reason, only to immediately\
  \ improve when paired with the right unit. "It''s not just equipment - it''s a bond."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} insists that machines have quirks, and some people sync\
  \ with them better than others. {1} notices who flows naturally with their unit and who is\
  \ constantly fighting it. "You don''t just control it - you work with it. And if that doesn''t\
  \ happen, you''re in the wrong machine."
MEK_MATCHMAKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t buy into standard assignments or universal\
  \ optimization. {1}''s watched people fall apart in machines that didn''t suit them, forced into\
  \ something they couldn''t adapt to. And when they hesitated? They didn''t survive. "You either\
  \ find the machine that matches you, or you die in the one that doesn''t."

MISSILE_JUNKIE.label=Overkill Enthusiast
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} refuses to take half-measures. If something needs to go\
  \ down, it needs to stay down. {1} doesn''t just eliminate threats - {2} obliterates them. "One shot?\
  \ Cute. I fired twenty just to be sure."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just win fights - {2} ensures absolute destruction.\
  \ Whether it''s an enemy force or an already-crippled target, {2} keeps firing. "If there''s still\
  \ salvage left, I obviously didn''t fire enough."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in measured responses anymore. {1}''s\
  \ watched people hesitate, watched {8}s get wiped out because they thought a single barrage was\
  \ enough. If {2}''s firing, {2}''s running till empty. If {2}''s striking, {2}''s leveling the whole damn\
  \ battlefield.
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in minimalist solutions. If something\
  \ needs fixing, {2} reinforces it beyond reason. If something needs supplies, {2} orders triple the\
  \ requirement. "Redundancy? No. This is just common sense."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} refuses to do anything halfway. If {2}''s organizing\
  \ something, it''s flawless. If {2}''s preparing for something, {2}''s over-prepared. "You think this\
  \ is too much? That''s just because you''ve never really been ready for anything."
MISSILE_JUNKIE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t push things to excess because {2} wants to - {2} does\
  \ it because {2}''s seen entire operations fail because people only did the minimum required. If {2}\
  \ does something, {2} makes damn sure there''s no chance of failure. "I don''t do ''just enough.'' I\
  \ do what actually works."

NEVER_RETREAT.label=Hates to Give Up
NEVER_RETREAT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in lost causes. As long as {2}''s\
  \ breathing, {2}''s still in the fight. {1}''ll push forward even when logic, reason, and survival\
  \ instincts say to fall back. "You think it''s over? Not until I say it is."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.1.COMBATANT=When others are ready to retreat, {0} is already planning {6}\
  \ next move. No matter how hopeless the situation looks, {2} refuses to stop. "We''ve lost when\
  \ we''re dead. And last time I checked, we''re still breathing."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what happens to those who give up. They don''t\
  \ get mercy, they don''t get a second chance. They get erased. {1} fights because stopping isn''t an\
  \ option. "Giving up isn''t survival. It''s just choosing to lose slower."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t accept failure as an answer. If a situation looks\
  \ unsalvageable, {2} doubles down, working harder, pushing past exhaustion until {2} finds a way.\
  \ "It''s not impossible. We just haven''t figured out how yet."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has zero patience for people who say something can''t be\
  \ done. {1}''ll stay up as long as it takes, trying every method, every angle, until {2} forces a\
  \ solution into existence. "I don''t fail. I solve problems. Even if it takes forever."
NEVER_RETREAT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched people give up - on their work, on their fight,\
  \ on themselves. {1}''s seen them fade away, crushed by war. That will not be {4}. {1} pushes on\
  \ because stopping means accepting defeat, and {0} does not accept defeat.

OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.label=Optimistic to a Fault
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} refuses to see a fight as unwinnable. Outnumbered? That\
  \ just means more targets. Outgunned? They''ll run out of ammo first. {5} confidence is\
  \ unshakable, even when reality says otherwise. "We just need one good break. And trust me - it''s\
  \ coming."
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just stay positive - {2} acts like things are going\
  \ great even when they absolutely aren''t. {1} could be the last one standing, surrounded,\
  \ bleeding, and still smirking. "We''ve got ''em right where we want ''em!"
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has to believe there''s hope, because if {2} stops\
  \ believing, what''s left? {1}''s seen what happens to those who accept reality for what it is. They\
  \ stop fighting. They give up. {1} refuses to let that happen to {4}. "No, we aren''t doomed. No,\
  \ we aren''t done. Not while I''m still standing."
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to accept unsolvable problems. Even when things\
  \ are falling apart, {2} keeps pushing forward, convinced there''s always a way to fix things.\
  \ "Don''t say ''it''s impossible.'' Say ''we haven''t figured it out yet.''"
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.1.SUPPORT=No matter how bad things get, {0} insists that it''s not that\
  \ bad - sometimes to the frustration of everyone else. "Sure, everything''s broken, the situation is\
  \ dire, and we''re completely unprepared, but think of the upside!"
OPTIMISTIC_TO_A_FAULT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows the truth of war, but {2} refuses to let it break\
  \ {4}. {1} stays positive because {2}''s seen what happens when people stop believing things can get\
  \ better. If that means lying to {4}self just to keep going, then so be it. "We''ll be fine. We\
  \ have to be fine."

REACTIVE.label=High Strung
REACTIVE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t do calm. Even when things aren''t urgent, {2}''s\
  \ tense, wired, ready to react. Every noise, every movement, every shift on the battlefield is\
  \ something {2}''s already preparing for. "Relax? We''re in a warzone. Relax after we survive."
REACTIVE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in safe moments. If things are too quiet,\
  \ if an operation is going smoothly, {2} starts getting worse, not better. "Something''s wrong.\
  \ It''s too easy. Too clean. There''s always something waiting."
REACTIVE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows what happens to those who get too comfortable. {1}''s\
  \ seen it, lived through it. One second, everything''s fine. The next, it''s over. {1} stays on edge\
  \ because {2} refuses to be caught off guard like that again.
REACTIVE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in small problems. If something is off,\
  \ it''s one step away from catastrophe. Every system failure, every missing supply, every\
  \ unexplained noise needs to be fixed immediately. "This isn''t just a glitch. This is how things\
  \ start falling apart."
REACTIVE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t do calm. If nothing is happening, {2}''s still\
  \ tense, still scanning the room, still bracing for something to go wrong. "You''re all too\
  \ relaxed. Something''s about to happen - I know it."
REACTIVE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t paranoid. {1}''s experienced. {1}''s seen good people\
  \ die because they trusted things would work out. {1} refuses to make that mistake. If {2} has to\
  \ carry the weight of constant vigi{8}, then so be it. "I''d rather be wrong a hundred times\
  \ than right just once when it''s too late."

RISK_TAKER.label=Extreme Risk Taker
RISK_TAKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in safe bets. If there''s a reckless,\
  \ high-stakes move that could turn the tide, {2}''s already going for it. "Sure, there''s a safer\
  \ way. But this way''s faster, riskier, and way more fun."
RISK_TAKER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} sees hesitation as worse than failure. The only way to\
  \ win is to take risks others won''t. {1} thrives in desperate situations, the kind where only\
  \ madmen or legends make it out alive. "They think I''m crazy. They just don''t understand what it\
  \ takes to win."
RISK_TAKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t take risks because {2} wants to live - {2} takes them\
  \ because {2}''s already made peace with dying. {1} pushes forward recklessly, making impossible\
  \ plays, because in {6} mind, {2} was never going to make it out of this war alive anyway.
RISK_TAKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never follows standard procedure when a faster, more\
  \ dangerous approach exists. {1} tests theories mid-operation, takes huge gambles on untested\
  \ ideas, and never waits for permission. "Calculated risks? Boring. Let''s just see what happens."
RISK_TAKER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hates slow, cautious approaches. If there''s a shortcut\
  \ that might work, {2}''s taking it. If there''s a wild, untested alternative, {2}''s all in. "Yeah,\
  \ yeah, it might backfire. But if it doesn''t, we just saved a ton of time."
RISK_TAKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust careful planning because {2}''s seen how\
  \ quickly everything falls apart no matter what precautions you take. If everything is destined\
  \ to fail eventually, why not push every decision to its absolute limit? "Caution won''t save you\
  \ when the end comes. Taking action might."

SIGNATURE_MOVE.label=Has a Signature Move
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} performs. Every battle, every\
  \ engagement, {2} executes {6} move, something distinct, unmistakable, {6} own. "If they survive,\
  \ they''ll remember exactly who did it."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t care if it''s tactically efficient - what matters is\
  \ style, impact, and recognition. If {2}''s going to win, {2}''s going to do it {6} way. "If they\
  \ don''t know it''s me by how I fight, then I''m not fighting right."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just want to win - {2} wants to be remembered. {1}\
  \ carves {6} identity into combat itself, ensuring that even if {2} doesn''t make it out, {6}\
  \ technique, {6} legacy, {6} name will live on. "If I fall, they''ll still be talking about me\
  \ years from now."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just do things - {2} does them {6} way. Whether it''s\
  \ a specific technique, a ritualized habit, or an unmistakable style, everything {2} touches feels\
  \ like {4}. "If you don''t recognize my work when you see it, then I''m doing something wrong."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in generic solutions. {5} way of solving\
  \ problems, fixing things, or handling challenges is something unique to {4} - and it always works.\
  \ "Anyone can do the job. I make it look good while I''m at it."
SIGNATURE_MOVE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too many people fade into nothing, their stories,\
  \ their impact erased by time and war. {1} refuses to be just another worker, just another body.\
  \ {5} signature move is more than just habit - it''s a way to make sure no one forgets {2} was here.

TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.label=Withdraws from Conflict
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see retreat as cowardice - {2} sees it as strategy.\
  \ If a fight isn''t worth it, if there''s a smarter way out, {2}''ll take it. "Survival isn''t about\
  \ winning every fight. It''s about knowing which ones to walk away from."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t engage in pointless fights. {1} picks {6} moments,\
  \ waits for the right time, and doesn''t waste energy on clashes that don''t matter. "Let them wear\
  \ themselves out. I''ll be here when it actually matters."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t withdraw because {2}''s afraid - {2} withdraws because\
  \ {2}''s tired. {1}''s seen too many fights, too much bloodshed, and {2} knows how easily lives are\
  \ thrown away for nothing. If {2} walks away, it''s because {2} values {6} survival more than\
  \ someone else''s idea of honor.
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t waste {6} time on pointless debates or petty\
  \ disputes. {1}''ll listen, nod, and then quietly walk away, letting others fight while {2} moves\
  \ on. "You all let me know when you''re done yelling. I''ll be over here actually getting things\
  \ done."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has no patience for drama, politics, or endless conflicts.\
  \ If something is going nowhere, {2} removes {4}self before it can drag {4} down too. "You want to\
  \ argue for hours? Be my guest. I''ve got better things to do."
TACTICAL_WITHDRAWAL.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched people destroy themselves over pointless\
  \ grudges, needless rivalries, and unwinnable battles. {1} refuses to become another casualty to\
  \ someone else''s pride. If stepping away means staying alive, then that''s exactly what {2}''ll do.

ACCENT_SWITCHER.label=Switches Accents Randomly
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s speech patterns are completely unpredictable. One\
  \ moment, {2}''s speaking with a crisp, formal tone; the next, {2}''s dropped into a thick drawl or\
  \ clipped military jargon. "Aye, lad, ye best watch yer flank - oh, wait, I mean, move your ass\
  \ before they frag you."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never explains why {2} does it, but {2}''ll slip into\
  \ different accents at the worst possible times. It''s hard to tell if it''s deliberate\
  \ misdirection or just habit. "Reckon we hit ''em hard, real cowboy style - or perhaps a more\
  \ refined approach is in order, oui?"
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has spent too long in too many places, surrounded by too\
  \ many different voices. {1} picks up accents without thinking, blending in, shifting, changing.\
  \ If {2} still remembers {6} real voice, {2} never lets it show. "I''ve been a lot of people. I\
  \ don''t even know which one''s actually me anymore."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s colleagues have given up trying to figure out {6}\
  \ origins. One day {2} sounds like a noble diplomat, the next {2}''s speaking like {2} just walked\
  \ out of a frontier settlement. "Oh, sugar, don''t worry none, I got it fixed - wait, pardon,\
  \ monsieur, I meant to say, the issue has been resolved."
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t even realize when {2} does it. Sometimes {2}''ll slip\
  \ into an accent mid-conversation and act like nothing happened. When called out on it? {1} just\
  \ shrugs. "Well, ain''t that just your perception, mate?"
ACCENT_SWITCHER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t force the accent changes - they happen on their own.\
  \ {1}''s lived too many lives, in too many places, and {6} voice reflects all of them. It''s not a\
  \ quirk - it''s a reminder that {2}''s never really belonged anywhere for long.

AMBUSH_LOVER.label=Walks Softly
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t stomp around like others do. {5} footsteps are\
  \ light, calculated, deliberate. One moment, {2}''s across the room; the next, {2}''s right behind\
  \ you. "You hear that? No? Exactly."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see the point in announcing {6} presence. Every\
  \ movement is controlled, every step soft. While others crash forward, {2}''s already maneuvering\
  \ unseen. "Loud gets you killed. Quiet lets you choose when to strike."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen enough ambushes, enough betrayals, enough\
  \ slaughter to know that noise only makes you a target. {1} doesn''t move loudly because {2} still\
  \ wants to be alive at the end of the day. "The moment they hear you, they''ve already decided\
  \ you''re dead."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} moves without sound, without warning, and it startles\
  \ everyone. One second the room is empty; the next, {2}''s just there. "I swear, {0}, you''ve got\
  \ to stop sneaking up on people." "...I walked in like normal."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t intentionally lurk, but {2}''s quiet enough that\
  \ people constantly forget {2}''s around. Conversations stop abruptly when {2} finally talks. "Oh,\
  \ wow - {0}, I didn''t even know you were here." "Yeah. I get that a lot."
AMBUSH_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t move loudly because {2} knows better. Being heard,\
  \ being seen, being noticed? That''s just an invitation for trouble. {1}''s learned that the longer\
  \ {2} stays quiet, the more likely {2} is to make it through whatever''s coming next. "The moment\
  \ they forget you''re there, you''ve already won."

BATTLE_HARDENED.label=Battle-Hardened Stoic
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t flinch at incoming fire, surprise ambushes, or\
  \ desperate last stands. {1}''s been through worse, and {2} never lets it show. "Panic won''t save\
  \ you. Keep moving."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t waste words on complaints, bravado, or false\
  \ hope. {1} fights, {2} endures, {2} survives, and that''s all there is to it. "Talk later. Fight\
  \ now."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t let {4}self feel anymore, not like {2} used to.\
  \ {1}''s watched too many people die, too many wars grind on without meaning. If {2} stops to\
  \ process it, it''ll break {4}. So {2} doesn''t. "Keep your head down. Keep moving. Nothing else\
  \ matters."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.0.SUPPORT={0} stays calm under pressure, never raising {6} voice, never\
  \ letting stress crack through. Alarms blaring? Still focused. People panicking? {1}''s already\
  \ handling the problem. "Losing your head won''t fix it. Focus."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t whine, grumble, or overreact. If something is bad,\
  \ {2} deals with it. If something is really bad, {2} deals with it harder. "Yeah. It''s bad. So fix\
  \ it."
BATTLE_HARDENED.description.2.SUPPORT={0} used to care, used to feel. But war doesn''t care, and\
  \ eventually, {2} learned to stop wasting energy on emotions no one had time for. If something''s\
  \ wrong, {2} fixes it. If something hurts, {2} pushes through it. "Pain means you''re still alive.\
  \ That''s all it means."

BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.label=Breaks Radio Silence
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} understands the importance of stealth and discipline, but\
  \ {2} just can''t help {4}self. The {8} is moving in total silence when suddenly: "Hey, anyone\
  \ else think this is way too quiet?"
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} hates absolute silence. It makes {6} skin crawl, sets {6}\
  \ nerves on edge. {1}''ll risk whispering, muttering, or making a joke just to break the tension.\
  \ "Radio''s dead silent? Yeah, okay, now I''m worried."
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has been there - the silence stretching on too long, the\
  \ slow realization that no one''s responding. If {2} speaks, it''s because {2} needs to hear someone\
  \ answer back. "Someone say something. Just... anything. I don''t care what."
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} knows when to keep {6} mouth shut. {1} just doesn''t care.\
  \ If the channel is dead silent for too long, {2}''ll drop in with something completely unnecessary.\
  \ "Sooo... what do you think the chances are that we aren''t walking into a trap?"
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t like silence. It feels unnatural, wrong, too\
  \ empty. If no one else is talking, {2}''ll fill the void, even if it gets {4} in trouble. "Okay,\
  \ but hypothetically, if I were to just start humming right now - "
BREAKS_RADIO_SILENCE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows exactly what it feels like to wait on the other end\
  \ of a dead radio, to call out and hear nothing in return. {1} talks because if {2} doesn''t, {2}''ll\
  \ start wondering if {2}''s the last one left. "Radio check. Someone say something. Now."

CONVOY_LOVER.label=Prefers Convoy Missions
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see convoy missions as boring logistics - {2} sees\
  \ them as a real test of skill. Protecting a moving force, managing ambush points, bottlenecks,\
  \ and chokepoints - to {4}, that''s the real game. "Stationary fights are predictable. Convoy\
  \ missions? That''s where you prove you know what you''re doing."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} likes that convoy missions matter. There''s something\
  \ different about ensuring something critical gets through, rather than just destroying a target.\
  \ "You''re not just fighting to win. You''re fighting to deliver something that matters."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched convoy missions go horribly wrong. {1}''s seen\
  \ supply lines torn apart, civilian transports ambushed, key assets lost forever. {1} takes them\
  \ personally now. "Convoy''s getting through. No matter what. No matter what."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} enjoys the rhythm of a convoy. The movement, the\
  \ preparation, the precision. There''s something about logistics in motion that makes sense to\
  \ {4}. "Nothing''s better than a well-organized convoy rolling like a well-oiled machine."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just care about getting somewhere - {2} enjoys the\
  \ process of getting there. The planning, the movement, the sense of progress. "A base is just a\
  \ place. The mission? That''s a story unfolding in real time."
CONVOY_LOVER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} understands that war isn''t won by battles - it''s won by\
  \ supply lines. {1}''s seen what happens when a convoy doesn''t make it. {1} knows that everything\
  \ collapses when the supplies stop coming. "Fights don''t matter if the people fighting don''t have\
  \ what they need. Convoy goes through. End of discussion."

CAMOUFLAGE.label=Likes to Blend In
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} makes sure {6} gear is invisible\
  \ until it''s too late. From terrain-matching coatings to active concealment tricks, {2} takes\
  \ hiding {6} equipment as seriously as {2} takes the fight itself. "If they don''t see it coming,\
  \ they don''t get a chance to react. That''s the whole point."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t believe in standard color schemes or obvious\
  \ silhouettes. {5} equipment always matches the terrain - dust-covered in deserts, ice-slicked in\
  \ tundras, urban-camouflaged in cities. "Standing out is just asking to get shot first."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched people die because they stood out, because\
  \ their gear wasn''t hidden well enough. {1} learned the hard way that survival is about not being\
  \ seen at all. "If they see you first, you''re already dead. Hide everything. Always."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} refuses to leave anything exposed. {1}''ll cover, blend, and\
  \ disguise anything that could be spotted from a distance. If something stands out, {2} fixes it\
  \ immediately. "Survival starts with us not being noticed at all."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} moves through situations without fanfare. {1}''s not\
  \ invisible, but people rarely notice when {2} arrives or leaves - just that things seem to run more\
  \ smoothly when {2}''s around. "Oh, {0} was here? Yeah. That makes sense."
CAMOUFLAGE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched others rise up, make names for themselves - only\
  \ to be cut down first when things go bad. {1}''s learned that staying unnoticed is the safest way\
  \ to survive. "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. I prefer not to be the nail."

DISTANT_LEADER.label=Leads from a Distance
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t shout orders from the front - {2} positions {4}self\
  \ where {2} can see everything, analyzing movements, making precise calls. "You don''t lead by\
  \ charging in. You lead by making sure everyone gets through alive."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t need spotlights, titles, or recognition to lead.\
  \ {5} voice is calm, {6} directions are measured, and {2} ensures {6} team is always positioned\
  \ for success. "I don''t need to be in front. I just need to be in control of the field."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows what happens to leaders who put themselves in the\
  \ thick of every fight. {1}''s buried too many of them. {1} stays just far enough back to keep\
  \ control, to make sure {6} people don''t die for nothing. "You want to be the hero? Go ahead.\
  \ I''ll make sure the rest of us survive."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t hover or demand attention - {2} sets things in\
  \ motion, gives clear direction, and lets things unfold as planned. "You don''t need to be in the\
  \ middle of everything to keep it running. You just need to know how to steer it from where you\
  \ are."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} is the kind of person who gives advice, direction, and\
  \ strategy, then steps right back into the background. {1} doesn''t need people to follow {4}\
  \ explicitly - {2} just makes sure they know where to go. "I don''t need credit. I just need this to\
  \ work."
DISTANT_LEADER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen leaders charge forward and never come back. {1}''s\
  \ watched too many put themselves at the center of things and get ripped apart. {1} stays where {2}\
  \ can be most useful, which means not dying for a symbol. "I lead from here because if I don''t,\
  \ there won''t be anyone left to lead."

DRAMATIC_FINISH.label=Prefers Dramatic Finishes
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just win - {2} makes sure everyone remembers how {2}\
  \ won. {1} times {6} final moves perfectly, adding a sense of style to every encounter. "Anyone\
  \ can win. Not everyone can make it look good."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1.COMBATANT={0} knows the fight is {6}, but {2} waits - lining up the\
  \ perfect shot, setting up a final strike that leaves no doubt. If it doesn''t feel cinematic, it\
  \ wasn''t done right. "It''s not just about beating them. It''s about ending it in a way they''ll\
  \ never forget."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2.COMBATANT={0} refuses to let {6} fights be just another skirmish. {1}''s\
  \ seen too many battles blend together, too many victories that feel hollow. If {2}''s going to\
  \ fight, then the ending better damn well be worth it. "If this is going to be another day of\
  \ war, I''m going to make sure the last second actually matters."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just complete things - {2} ensures that the ending\
  \ feels significant. Whether it''s a final word, a well-timed reveal, or a perfect conclusion, {2}\
  \ knows how to leave an impression. "No, no, no. You can''t just finish it. You have to stick the\
  \ landing."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hates anticlimaxes. If something is wrapping up, {2} will\
  \ make sure it happens with flare, weight, and the perfect sense of timing. "You don''t just fade\
  \ out. You make sure the last thing they see is the part they''ll remember."
DRAMATIC_FINISH.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched people disappear, missions end without\
  \ closure, lives lost without significance. {1} refuses to let {6} own moments fade into\
  \ obscurity. Every ending needs impact - because if it doesn''t, then what was the point of\
  \ anything? "If this all has to end, then damn it, it better end in a way that lasts."

ENGINE_REVERER.label=Emphatic with Technology
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see machines as lifeless tools - {2} treats them\
  \ with respect, patience, and understanding. {1} swears {6} weapons fight better when {2}\
  \ acknowledges them properly. "A machine isn''t just metal and circuits. It knows when you trust\
  \ it - and when you don''t."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has seen too many people abuse their gear, rush their\
  \ startup sequences, ignore the warning hum of a system under stress. {1} refuses to do the same.\
  \ "You listen to it, you learn from it, and it will take care of you in return."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t think failures are random. {1}''s watched unworthy\
  \ hands try to control machines they didn''t respect, and watched those machines betray them in\
  \ their moment of need. "Call it superstition. But if you don''t show your machine respect, one\
  \ day, it won''t be there when you need it most."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never just interacts with technology - {2} communicates with\
  \ it. Whether it''s a quick word of encouragement, a gentle pat on the side of a console, or a\
  \ quiet thank you, {2} believes it matters. "You''d be amazed what a little appreciation does.\
  \ Machines like being treated well."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} swears different machines have different moods. Some are\
  \ stubborn, some are temperamental, and some respond to kindness. If something refuses to work,\
  \ {2} doesn''t assume it''s broken - {2} assumes it''s upset. "Give it a second. It''s just being\
  \ difficult today. Happens to everyone."
ENGINE_REVERER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows too many people who treated their machines like\
  \ soulless tools - and they''re gone now. Maybe it''s coincidence. Maybe it''s not. But {2}''s not going\
  \ to take that chance. "Machines remember. They know who respects them, and they know who\
  \ doesn''t."

FLIRTY_COMMS.label=Flirts Over Comms
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} never lets the chaos of battle stop {4} from throwing in\
  \ a well-timed flirt. Explosions in the background? Enemy fire raining down? {1}''s still casually\
  \ complimenting someone''s voice over the comms. "You know, if we survive this, you owe me dinner\
  \ for saving your ass just now."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} knows the situation is serious, but that doesn''t mean {2}\
  \ can''t have a little fun. Whether it''s teasing an ally or shamelessly charming the enemy, {2}\
  \ keeps things light. "Your targeting is getting better. Or are you just trying to impress me?"
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows that every battle might be {6} last. So why not\
  \ enjoy {4}self while {2} can? If {2}''s going out, {2}''s going out with a smirk and a last-minute\
  \ confession. "If this is it, I need you to know... I''ve always looked great doing this."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can be discussing critical situations, but that won''t stop\
  \ {4} from dropping a playful remark or two. Whether it''s mock admiration or genuine charm, {2}\
  \ makes sure no conversation is boring. "That''s a beautiful comms setup you''ve got there. But not\
  \ as beautiful as the voice coming through it."
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a gift for casually throwing out flirtatious remarks\
  \ with zero hesitation. Half the time, people aren''t even sure if {2} means it. "Oh, you sound\
  \ stressed. Want me to whisper sweet nothings about how competent you are?" They''re not always\
  \ appropriate.
FLIRTY_COMMS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t flirt just to entertain {4}self - {2} does it because\
  \ the alternative is silence. {1} keeps things playful because if {2} stops, {2} has to think about\
  \ what happens when there''s no one left to talk to at all. "Don''t go quiet on me now. Who else am\
  \ I supposed to charm while the world falls apart?"

FOCUS_FREAK.label=Hyper-Focused Under Pressure
FOCUS_FREAK.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t crack under pressure - {2} sharpens. When everything\
  \ is going wrong, when the chaos is at its peak, {2} locks in, making perfect calls and impossibly\
  \ fast reactions. "Panicking won''t save you. Thinking faster than the enemy will."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.1.COMBATANT={0} might be distracted, restless, or even reckless when\
  \ things are calm, but the moment the situation turns critical, {2}''s all focus. No wasted\
  \ movements, no unnecessary words - just pure, disciplined action. "Everything else? Doesn''t matter\
  \ right now. We do this, and we survive."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched hesitation get people killed. {1}''s seen what\
  \ happens when fear takes over. So when things get bad, {2} shuts everything out, narrowing down\
  \ to what needs to happen to stay alive. "If you stop to think about how bad it is, it''s already\
  \ too late."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.0.SUPPORT={0} might be laid back or unfocused when things are normal,\
  \ but when things start falling apart, {2}''s suddenly the most competent person in the room. No\
  \ hesitation, no wasted energy - just pure execution. "You can freak out after we fix this. Right\
  \ now, we get it done."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.1.SUPPORT={0} shuts out distractions, ignores the noise, and locks in on\
  \ the task at hand. When the stakes are high, {2} works with a speed and intensity that almost\
  \ doesn''t seem possible. "Everything else? Irrelevant. We get through this first. Then you can\
  \ breathe."
FOCUS_FREAK.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t focus because {2} wants to - {2} focuses because\
  \ failure isn''t an option. {1}''s seen what happens when things aren''t handled fast enough, when\
  \ mistakes slip through, when people hesitate. "You think you have time to worry? You don''t. Do\
  \ it right now or don''t do it at all."

FOUL_MOUTHED.label=Foul-Mouthed
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s comms are a constant stream of expletives, whether {2}''s\
  \ frustrated, excited, or just having a normal conversation. {5} insults are creative, effective,\
  \ and completely unfiltered. "Oh, for ****''s sake, that''s the worst shooting I''ve ever seen! Do\
  \ I need to ****ing hold your hand out here?"
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just swear - {2} weaponizes it. {5} profanity is so\
  \ aggressive that it either rallies {6} allies or completely rattles {6} enemies. "Listen here,\
  \ you miserable pack of rusted ****-stains, either you run now or I''ll show you what a real\
  \ ****ing disaster looks like."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to care about how {2} spoke, about keeping things\
  \ professional. But war has burned that away. Now, {6} language is raw, brutal, and\
  \ honest - because what''s the point in holding back? "I don''t have time for your ****ing optimism.\
  \ We''re knee-deep in **** and unless you stop talking and start shooting, we''re going to die in\
  \ it."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can''t do anything without a few choice words. Whether {2}''s\
  \ talking to {4}self, complaining about a minor inconvenience, or offering ''constructive\
  \ feedback'', {2}''s always swearing. "Oh, you''ve got to be ****ing kidding me. Who the **** put\
  \ this together? A ****ing blindfolded toddler?!"
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s tone barely changes between casual conversation and\
  \ absolute rage, making it nearly impossible to tell when {2}''s genuinely furious or just talking\
  \ normally. "Yeah, yeah, we''ll get it done. Relax. Stop looking at me like that, this is just how\
  \ I ****ing talk."
FOUL_MOUTHED.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t dress things up, doesn''t soften the truth. {1}\
  \ calls things exactly as they are, and if that means dropping more expletives than actual words,\
  \ so be it. "You want me to phrase it nicely? Fine. We''re totally ****ed."

FREESTYLE_COMBAT.label=Has a Freestyle Approach
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t do structured plans or textbook strategies. {1}\
  \ improvises on the fly, adjusting as the fight unfolds, reacting faster than anyone expects.\
  \ "Look, I could follow protocol, or I could just do what actually works. Guess which one I''m\
  \ picking?"
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} trusts instinct over orders, flow over formation. {5}\
  \ style is chaotic but effective, and somehow, it keeps working. "Plans fall apart. Tactics get\
  \ countered. You know what doesn''t? Thinking faster than the other guy."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} used to follow orders, used to stick to the doctrine. But\
  \ {2}''s watched it fail, seen people die because they did what they were told instead of what\
  \ actually needed to be done. Now? {1} adapts, or {2} dies. "You want me to follow the plan\
  \ exactly? Then tell me how that worked out for the last poor bastard who tried it."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t care about standard procedures or official\
  \ methods. If there''s a faster, more efficient, or completely unconventional way to do something,\
  \ {2}''s already doing it. "Oh, you wanted it done properly? No. I got it done right."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has no patience for needless steps or bureaucratic\
  \ nonsense. {1} finds solutions in the moment, working on instinct rather than instructions. "You\
  \ want a process? Fine. Here''s my process: I make it work."
FREESTYLE_COMBAT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust manuals, procedures, or carefully written\
  \ guidelines. {1}''s seen too many people waste time following the rules while everything burned\
  \ around them. {1} works fast, loose, and with no hesitation - because that''s what keeps people\
  \ alive. "You can either waste time doing it the right way, or you can do it my way and actually\
  \ survive this."

GEOMETRY_GURU.label=Geometry Guru
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} calculates. Every shot, every\
  \ movement, every approach is based on angles, arcs, and positioning. "You don''t just fire - you\
  \ predict. You don''t just move - you control the space."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never fires blindly; every shot is lined up, ricocheted,\
  \ or angled for maximum impact. {1} treats the battlefield like a perfectly plotted\
  \ three-dimensional puzzle. "Everything has a weak spot. You just have to find the right angle to\
  \ exploit it."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust luck, instinct, or blind aggression. {1}\
  \ trusts geometry. {1}''s seen how battles turn into chaos, how emotions get people killed - but\
  \ angles? Angles don''t lie. "It''s not about winning. It''s about solving for X. And in this case,\
  \ X is the fastest way to make them not my problem."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.0.SUPPORT={0} can''t unsee geometry in everything. The way things align,\
  \ the way efficiency improves when angles are perfect, the mathematical beauty of well-organized\
  \ space. "You don''t just put things down randomly. You optimize them."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a habit of breaking down even the simplest things into\
  \ mathematical terms. Whether it''s lining up objects, explaining movement patterns, or analyzing\
  \ layouts, {2}''s always thinking in angles. "Look, you could do it that way, but if you shift it\
  \ 17 degrees, you''ll maximize efficiency by at least 12%."
GEOMETRY_GURU.description.2.SUPPORT={0} finds comfort in numbers, angles, and predictable\
  \ calculations because everything else is chaos. {1} can''t control the war, the losses, the\
  \ destruction - but {2} can control how things align, how things flow, how everything fits into\
  \ place. "The world falls apart, people die, plans fail. But geometry? Geometry is perfect."

ICE_COLD.label=Emotionless in Crisis
ICE_COLD.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t panic, doesn''t flinch, doesn''t react to chaos\
  \ like everyone else does. Whether it''s losing an advantage, being outnumbered, or watching\
  \ allies fall, {2} just keeps moving. "Fear won''t save you. Acting will."
ICE_COLD.description.1.COMBATANT={0} speaks in the same steady, flat tone whether {2}''s giving\
  \ orders, dodging fire, or watching a disaster unfold. {1} operates like a machine, precise and\
  \ deliberate, even as everything around {4} burns. "We handle it. That''s all. Doesn''t matter how\
  \ bad it looks."
ICE_COLD.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched panic kill more people than bullets. {1}''s\
  \ buried leaders who froze up, warriors who hesitated, teams who lost control. {1} learned long\
  \ ago that shutting it all out is the only way to make it through. "Doesn''t matter how bad it is.\
  \ I''ll deal with it. Because I always do."
ICE_COLD.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t rush, panic, or even raise {6} voice when things\
  \ go wrong. {1} simply assesses the problem, executes the next step, and moves forward. "Crisis?\
  \ No. It''s just a situation that needs handling."
ICE_COLD.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s voice stays calm and even while everyone else is losing\
  \ their minds. It doesn''t matter how bad things get - {6} response is always unshaken, controlled,\
  \ and matter-of-fact. "Yeah, it''s bad. No, that doesn''t change what we need to do."
ICE_COLD.description.2.SUPPORT={0} used to feel more, used to let {4}self react. But {2}''s\
  \ seen too many people lose control, seen how fast things spiral the moment someone lets fear in.\
  \ Now, {2} keeps it buried - because survival demands it. "You think staying calm is easy? No. But\
  \ it''s the only reason I''m still here."

PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.label=Extremely Picky
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} won''t just take any weapon, ''Mek, or gear - {2} has\
  \ preferences, and {2} sticks to them religiously. If something isn''t precisely the way {2} likes\

  \ right one.
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} will absolutely fight in whatever conditions {2} has to,\
  \ but that doesn''t mean {2} won''t voice {6} disappointment the entire time. Whether it''s loadout\
  \ choices, terrain, or enemy tactics, {2} has opinions. "You call this a firing position? No\
  \ cover, bad angles, and don''t get me started on the damn wind."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen people die because they settled for "good\
  \ enough". {1} refuses to make that mistake. If something isn''t exactly right, it''s wrong, and {2}\
  \ won''t compromise. "Precision isn''t optional. You think I''m difficult? Fine. At least I''ll still\
  \ be alive."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has preferences for everything - how things are arranged,\
  \ how people talk, how tasks should be done. If something is off by even a fraction, {2}''ll notice\
  \ it immediately. "No, absolutely not. That''s three degrees off-center, and now it''s all ruined."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just complain - {2} fixes things. If something isn''t\
  \ up to {6} personal standard, {2}''ll redo it from scratch. "Look, I don''t trust anyone else to do\
  \ it right. Just let me handle it before I lose my mind."
PICKY_ABOUT_GEAR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} wasn''t always this particular, but {2}''s seen what happens\
  \ when people let things slide. Small mistakes lead to bigger ones, and bigger mistakes get\
  \ people killed. {1} refuses to be another casualty of carelessness. "You think it doesn''t matter?\
  \ That''s what they said before everything went to hell."

RECORD_KEEPER.label=Statistics Nerd
RECORD_KEEPER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just react in combat - {2} analyzes. Every shot,\
  \ every maneuver, every decision is backed by numbers and probability models. "The odds of that\
  \ working are less than 12%, but sure, let''s pretend luck is real."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has a fact or figure for every situation, whether it''s\
  \ accuracy rates, survival odds, or enemy engagement trends. {1} never just trusts intuition.\
  \ "Statistically speaking, you should already be dead. But hey, keep doing whatever it is you\
  \ call ''strategy.''"
RECORD_KEEPER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust gut feelings or heroics - {2} trusts data.\
  \ {1}''s watched people make emotional decisions, and {2}''s seen how that ends. {1} survives because\
  \ {2} follows the numbers. "Your instincts don''t mean ****. The data says this is a bad idea. I''m\
  \ listening to the data."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has a number for everything. If something has happened\
  \ before, been studied, or analyzed, {2} knows the probability of it happening again - and {2} will\
  \ bring it up. "Based on historical trends, there''s a 76% chance this will fail exactly the same\
  \ way as last time."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} will correct you if you''re exaggerating, estimating\
  \ wildly, or misrepresenting statistics. {1} doesn''t care if it''s annoying - {2} cares about\
  \ accuracy. "Actually, you''re off by 3.7%, but sure, let''s round it up and pretend that''s fine."
RECORD_KEEPER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has stopped believing in luck, instincts, or gut feelings.\
  \ {1}''s seen too many people bet on hope and lose. The numbers are cold, cruel, and unforgiving,\
  \ but at least they don''t lie to you. "Hope gets people killed. Statistics tell you when they''re\
  \ going to die."

RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.label=Resourceful
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t panic when things go wrong - {2} adapts. Running low\
  \ on ammo? {1}''s already found an alternative. Outnumbered? {1}''s using the terrain to even the\
  \ odds. "Doesn''t matter what we have. What matters is how we use it."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never sees {4}self as out of options. If something looks\
  \ useless, it just means {2} hasn''t figured out how to use it yet. "A bad position? No, it''s a\
  \ perfect trap if you know how to set it up."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t expect resupplies, doesn''t assume backup is\
  \ coming. {1}''s seen what happens when people rely on things they can''t control. If {2}''s going to\
  \ survive, it''ll be because {2} made something out of nothing. "War doesn''t care what you don''t\
  \ have. You fight with what''s in front of you, or you die waiting for something better."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in impossible problems. If something\
  \ can''t be done, {2} finds another way. {5} solutions are unconventional, creative, and sometimes\
  \ reckless, but they always work. "If the rulebook says it can''t be done, the rulebook is wrong."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t need ideal circumstances - {2} excels in the worst\
  \ ones. Whether it''s repurposing old materials, finding alternatives, or just knowing exactly\
  \ what to prioritize, {2} gets it done. "You think we don''t have what we need? We do. You just\
  \ don''t see it yet."
RESOURCE_SCROUNGER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too many people die waiting for a solution\
  \ instead of making one. {1} refuses to be one of them. If something needs fixing, if a problem\
  \ needs solving, {2} will find a way, no matter what it takes. "We can wait for a miracle, or we\
  \ can make one. Your call."

TRASH_TALKER.label=Relentless Trash Talker
TRASH_TALKER.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} talks through the entire damn\
  \ thing. Whether {2}''s mocking an enemy''s aim, critiquing their strategy, or giving sarcastic\
  \ play-by-plays, {2} never lets up. "Oh wow, you actually hit something! Shame it wasn''t me, but\
  \ hey, small victories, right?"
TRASH_TALKER.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just insult - {2} targets weaknesses, exploits\
  \ frustration, and makes sure the enemy is too pissed off to think straight. "Oh no, don''t take\
  \ your time! It''s not like I''ve dodged this same move six times already."
TRASH_TALKER.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows every fight could be {6} last, but if {2}''s going\
  \ out, {2}''s making sure {6} enemies hate {4} to the bitter end. {1} mocks to stay sane, to keep\
  \ the fear out, to make sure {2} never starts thinking too hard about how easily {2} could die.\
  \ "Hey, if you kill me, at least you''ll finally have something to brag about."
TRASH_TALKER.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never lets a moment pass without some kind of remark,\
  \ whether it''s teasing, sarcasm, or brutal honesty disguised as humor. "Oh, fantastic job\
  \ screwing that up in record time. Really, I''m impressed."
TRASH_TALKER.description.1.SUPPORT={0}''s trash talk isn''t cruel - it''s just how {2} interacts. If\
  \ {2}''s not making fun of you, it''s probably a bad sign. "Oh, you actually got it right this time?\
  \ Guess miracles do happen."
TRASH_TALKER.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trash talk just for fun - {2} does it because if {2}\
  \ doesn''t keep things light, everything gets too heavy. {1} keeps the mocking, the teasing, the\
  \ insults flowing, because it''s easier than thinking about how little room there is for laughter\
  \ in war. "Oh, we''re probably doomed, but at least I''ll get to make fun of you until we''re all\
  \ dead."

CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.label=Quick to Correct Pronouns
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t let bullets, explosions, or chaos stop {4} from\
  \ making sure people get pronouns right. {1}''ll dodge incoming fire while effortlessly correcting\
  \ someone mid-sentence. "Yeah, yeah, cover me - also, ''they'' just took down two enemies, not ''she.''\
  \ Now move."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} treats pronouns like any other battlefield precision - you\
  \ don''t mess them up. {1}''ll make a correction without missing a beat, right alongside calling out\
  \ enemy positions or tactical shifts. "Enemy at your nine o''clock, fallback route is clear, and\
  \ you misgendered them again - fix it."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen people lose everything - homes, families, futures.\
  \ But names, pronouns, identity itself? That''s one thing war shouldn''t erase. So {2} doesn''t let\
  \ it slide. Ever. "You respect who they are, or you don''t deserve to fight alongside them."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t make a big deal about it - {2} just corrects people''s\
  \ pronouns instantly and moves on. It''s as natural to {4} as breathing. "Yeah, she''s handling\
  \ that - no, wait, they are. Anyway, back to what I was saying."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hears everything, and if a pronoun is wrong, {2} corrects\
  \ it. Doesn''t matter if it''s in passing or during a high-stakes discussion - {2}''s fixing it\
  \ immediately. "Not ''her,'' they. Keep going."
CORRECTS_PRONOUNS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has watched countless people reduced to statistics, ranks,\
  \ and numbers. {1} refuses to let identity become just another casualty. {1} will always correct\
  \ someone''s pronouns with a quick, "if we lose who we are, then what the hell are we even\
  \ fighting for?"

BODY_DISCOMFORT.label=Uncomfortable in Their Own Body
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} fights hard, fast, aggressive - but it never feels natural.\
  \ There''s a hesitation in {6} movements, a disconnect between body and instinct, like {2}''s\
  \ piloting {4}self instead of simply existing. "I move because standing still feels worse."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} runs {4}self ragged - pushing {6} body to the limit, past\
  \ the pain, past exhaustion. It''s not just discipline - it''s a way to feel something other than\
  \ this quiet, crawling wrongness. "If I stop moving, I start thinking. And I don''t like where\
  \ that leads."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} wears the uniform, the gear, the weight of the war - but\
  \ none of it ever feels real. {1} moves like {2}''s trapped in armor that isn''t {6} own, unsure if\
  \ the person {2} once was is even still underneath it all. "I don''t know if this body was ever\
  \ mine. I just know it''s the only one I''ve got to keep surviving in."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never sits still. {1} shifts {6} stance, tugs at sleeves,\
  \ readjusts posture - always moving, always slightly off-ba{8}, like nothing ever feels fully\
  \ settled. "I''m fine. Just... this shirt''s wrong. Or maybe it''s just me."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} avoids catching {6} own reflection, doesn''t linger when\
  \ changing, keeps {6} focus on anything but {4}self. If {2} talks about {6} body, it''s with\
  \ detachment, like it''s just another object {2} happens to be stuck with. "It''s just a body. It\
  \ works. That''s all that matters."
BODY_DISCOMFORT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} wonders if the person {2} was supposed to be got lost\
  \ somewhere before the war, before all of this. If the body {2} has is {6}, or just something the\
  \ world forced {4} into. "I don''t know if I hate this body, or if I just hate the way it never\
  \ really felt like mine."

MEK_COMFORT.label=Uncomfortable Off-Duty
MEK_COMFORT.description.0.COMBATANT={0} feels restless the second {2}''s not in combat. Sitting\
  \ still, relaxing - it just doesn''t feel right. {1} moves like {2}''s waiting for something to go\
  \ wrong, even when everything''s fine. "Off-duty? What does that even mean? Feels like a damn\
  \ trap."
MEK_COMFORT.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust peace, silence, or downtime. {5} mind stays\
  \ wired for battle, scanning for threats that aren''t there, anticipating the next crisis before\
  \ it happens. "This isn''t normal. Something''s coming. It always does."
MEK_COMFORT.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has been at war for too long. The fight is the only thing\
  \ that makes sense - without it, {2} feels empty, lost, disconnected. {1} moves through off-duty life\
  \ like a ghost, just waiting to be pulled back into the only thing that feels real. "Out there, I\
  \ know who I am. Here? I don''t know what the hell I''m supposed to do."
MEK_COMFORT.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t sit back and enjoy downtime - {2} finds something to\
  \ do, even when it''s unnecessary. If there''s nothing urgent, {2} makes up reasons to stay\
  \ occupied. "Rest? No, I''m good. I''ll... I''ll find something to work on."
MEK_COMFORT.description.1.SUPPORT={0} hates long stretches of nothing. {1} needs movement,\
  \ action, some kind of task. When forced to relax, {2} becomes short-tempered, distracted, always\
  \ glancing toward the door like {2}''s waiting to be called back in. "How do people do this? Just...\
  \ sit here? For hours?"
MEK_COMFORT.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen too many quiet moments shattered by disaster.\
  \ {1}''s lived through peace turning into chaos in an instant. So {2} never fully relaxes, never\
  \ lets {6} guard down, because {2} knows what happens when you do. "The second you start thinking\
  \ you''re safe, that''s when it happens. That''s when you lose everything."

FEAR_OF_FIRE.label=Fear of Fire
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fear fire - {2} hates it. Flamethrowers,\
  \ explosions, even the glow of overheating systems make {6} breath catch in {6} throat. {1} fights\
  \ like {2}''s always one step ahead of an inferno only {2} can see. "No. No fire. I don''t care how\
  \ controlled it is - I said no."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t play with fire. {1}''ll take detours, avoid cover\
  \ that looks too flammable, refuse to engage near heat sources. It''s not paranoia - it''s survival.\
  \ "You want to fight in that sector? Surrounded by fuel tanks? Yeah. No. Find another route."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fear fire - {2}''s watched it consume people.\
  \ {1}''s heard the screams, smelled the smoke, seen what''s left after an inferno. And {2} knows that\
  \ if {2} ever ends up in that situation, there won''t be anything left to save. "I''d take a bullet\
  \ over fire. A hundred times over. At least a bullet leaves something behind."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} hates fire, hates the smell of burning, hates the way it\
  \ moves. Even small, harmless flames make {6} hands tighten, {6} pulse quicken. {1} doesn''t say\
  \ anything, but {2} never takes {6} eyes off them until they''re out. "No, I''m fine. Just - could you\
  \ put that out already?"
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} won''t admit {2}''s afraid, but {2}''ll always have a reason to\
  \ leave a room where something''s burning, to avoid places that smell like smoke, to never stand\
  \ too close to heat sources. "You all enjoy the bonfire. I''ll be over here. Far away from it."
FEAR_OF_FIRE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has seen people burn. {1}''s heard their screams, watched\
  \ them writhe, smelled what''s left after the flames finally die out. And every time {2} does, {2}\
  \ swears it won''t be {4}. "If fire ever comes for me, I won''t give it the chance. I''ll make sure\
  \ I go before it gets me."

TOUCH_SENSITIVE.label=Touch Sensitive
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} hates being touched unexpectedly. A hand on {6} shoulder?\
  \ Instant tension. A brush against {6} arm? Barely-contained instinct to pull away. {1} moves like\
  \ someone who''s always bracing for an impact that hasn''t come yet. "Don''t - just don''t touch me\
  \ without warning."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} fights best when there''s space between {4} and {6}\
  \ enemies. {1} doesn''t like being grabbed, held, or pressed into close-range combat - it makes {6}\
  \ skin crawl. "I don''t do grappling. If they get that close, I make sure they don''t stay there."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t flinch because {2}''s nervous - {2} flinches because\
  \ too many times, a hand on {6} arm was followed by a knife, a grip on {6} shoulder by a strike.\
  \ {1}''s learned that even friendly touches can turn deadly in an instant. "Every time someone''s\
  \ grabbed me without warning, something bad followed. You expect me to just forget that?"
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t obvious about it, but any time someone accidentally\
  \ brushes against {4}, claps {4} on the back, or leans in too close, {6} body reacts before {2}\
  \ does. "Nothing''s wrong. Just - don''t do that again."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} is constantly adjusting, subtly shifting away from people\
  \ without making a scene. It''s not hostile - it''s just instinct. {1} moves like someone who never\
  \ quite feels comfortable in physical space with others. "It''s not you. I just... prefer some\
  \ space."
TOUCH_SENSITIVE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t hate touch - {2} just can''t handle it. It makes\
  \ everything feel too real, too immediate, too much. The war, the weight of existence, the\
  \ feeling of being trapped in a body {2} never fully accepted. "Just - don''t touch me. I don''t need\
  \ a reason."

HOLOVID_FANATIC.label=Holovid Fanatic
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} has a line from a holovid for every situation. Even in\
  \ the middle of combat, {2}''s dropping one-liners, reenacting dramatic moments, and making sure\
  \ everyone knows exactly which classic scene they''re living through. "You ever see Steel Storm\
  \ VI? Yeah? Then you know what happens next."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} fully believes in the coolest, most dramatic ways to\
  \ fight. If there''s a stylish, over-the-top holovid maneuver that probably shouldn''t work, {2}''s\
  \ trying it anyway. "Okay, hear me out - if I time this just right, it''ll look incredible."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows real war isn''t like the holovids, but if {2} lets\
  \ {4}self think about that too much, the weight of reality will crush {4}. So {2} plays the part,\
  \ delivers the lines, and pretends the good guys always win. "Tell me this isn''t exactly like\
  \ that scene from Blood Horizon. Just let me have this."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just watch holovids - {2} lives and breathes them.\
  \ Every conversation is sprinkled with deep-cut references that absolutely no one understands.\
  \ "Oh, this is exactly like Nightfall Over Terra-7. Wait, you haven''t seen it? What do you do\
  \ with your life?"
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has a holovid moment for everything. If something happens,\
  \ {2}''s already comparing it to a classic scene, no matter how ridiculous the connection is.\
  \ "This? This is straight out of The Curse of Atlas. Trust me, we''re about to hit the third-act\
  \ twist."
HOLOVID_FANATIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows holovids are escapism, but {2} doesn''t care. They''re\
  \ structured, predictable, full of meaning. Unlike the mess that is real life, where nothing\
  \ follows a script and everything falls apart for no reason. "Real life''s got terrible pacing. At\
  \ least in holovids, things happen for a reason."

INVINCIBLE.label=Convinced They''re Invincible
INVINCIBLE.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just take risks - {2} welcomes them. {1}''ll charge\
  \ headfirst into fire, take the most dangerous route, and act like {2}''s physically incapable of\
  \ dying. "Oh, relax. I''ve survived worse than this. Probably."
INVINCIBLE.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see narrow escapes as luck - {2} sees them as\
  \ confirmation. Every bullet that whizzes past, every enemy that fails to land a hit just fuels\
  \ {6} belief that {2}''s untouchable. "You see that? Didn''t even graze me. Like I said, they can''t\
  \ hit me."
INVINCIBLE.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t let {4}self believe in {6} own mortality, because\
  \ if {2} does, the weight of everything {2}''s survived, everything {2}''s lost might crush {4}. It''s\
  \ not arrogance - it''s desperation. "I can''t die. Not yet. Not like they did."
INVINCIBLE.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t hesitate before doing something reckless, whether\
  \ it''s lifting something way too heavy, skipping proper procedures, or ignoring obvious hazards.\
  \ {1} acts like the rules don''t apply to {4}. "Oh, come on. What''s the worst that could happen?\
  \ Never happened to me before."
INVINCIBLE.description.1.SUPPORT={0} has walked away from disasters unscathed so many times that\
  \ {2}''s convinced it''s not luck - it''s just how things work for {4}. {1} treats every near-miss as\
  \ proof of {6} invulnerability, yelling out "I am invincible" at the slightest provocation.
INVINCIBLE.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t stupid. {1} knows people die - {2}''s seen it happen too\
  \ many times. But if {2} ever lets {4}self think it could happen to {4}, if {2} ever lets fear\
  \ creep in, {2} knows it''ll slow {4} down, make {4} hesitate. And hesitation gets you killed.\
  \ "You think I''m reckless? No. I just refuse to believe I''m next."

STUTTERS.label=Stutters
STUTTERS.description.0.COMBATANT={0}''s voice may stumble, but {6} hands never shake. {1} might\
  \ struggle to get the words out, but when the moment comes to act, {2}''s quicker and sharper than\
  \ anyone else. "L-l-listen, I d-don''t need to s-say it twice. Y-you better move n-now."
STUTTERS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} hides behind jokes, dry remarks, and an attitude, but\
  \ when the adrenaline spikes, the stutter follows. {1} plays it off, but everyone knows {2}''s\
  \ trying to bury it under bravado. "Oh, y-you think you''re g-g-good? G-give me a sec, lemme just\
  \ d-d-dodge that like it''s n-n-nothing."
STUTTERS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} wasn''t always like this. Maybe it was the stress, the\
  \ years of battle, the losses piling up. Whatever the cause, {6} mouth can''t always keep up with\
  \ {6} brain anymore. "It''s j-j-just a voice, r-right? As long as I c-can still f-f-fight, it\
  \ d-doesn''t matter."
STUTTERS.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s mind is fast, but sometimes {6} words aren''t. {1} knows\
  \ the answer, knows what needs to be done, but getting it out in real time takes effort. "I-it''s\
  \ n-not that c-c-complicated. J-just f-follow the d-d-damn instructions."
STUTTERS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t mind people noticing - {2} minds when they pretend not\
  \ to hear it. {1} waves it off, but every once in a while, you can see the frustration flicker\
  \ through. "Yeah, yeah, I g-g-get it, I t-trip over my words. B-but you know w-w-what? I still\
  \ get sh-sh-**** done."
STUTTERS.description.2.SUPPORT={0}''s body keeps going, but {6} mind is fractured in ways {2}''ll\
  \ never fully fix. The stutter is just a symptom, a telltale sign that something in {4} is still\
  \ processing all the things {2}''ll never talk about. "J-j-just let me w-w-work. D-d-doesn''t matter\
  \ how I say it, as long as I g-g-get it d-d-done."

ACROPHOBIA.label=Afraid of Heights
ACROPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hesitate in a fight, doesn''t flinch at\
  \ explosions, doesn''t fear charging into danger. But the second {2}''s too high off the ground,\
  \ that confidence vanishes. "No. I don''t need a ''better vantage point.'' I need to be on the\
  \ ground where I belong."
ACROPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} is known for being fearless - until a situation involves\
  \ height. {1} avoids cliffs, refuses to stand near edges, and takes every alternate route\
  \ possible. "Yeah, yeah, I know it''s the ''quickest way.'' It''s also a death sentence. Find another\
  \ path."
ACROPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched people go over the edge. {1}''s seen what''s\
  \ left when they hit the ground. {1} remembers the silence right before impact. {5} fear isn''t\
  \ irrational - it''s experience. "You ever hear the sound someone makes when they realize there''s no\
  \ way back? I have. That''s why I''m staying right here."
ACROPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} will find another way, no matter how impractical. Ladders,\
  \ scaffolding, high walkways - {2}''ll go twice the distance if it means staying close to the ground.\
  \ "Nah, not my problem. Someone else can deal with it. Preferably someone who doesn''t value their\
  \ life."
ACROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} plays it cool, but if you watch closely, {2} never gets too\
  \ close to anything with a sheer drop. {1} keeps {6} distance, avoids looking down, and never\
  \ volunteers for anything involving heights. "Nope. Not happening. You want me to do what? Yeah,\
  \ I don''t think so."
ACROPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just fear falling - {2} fears what happens after. The\
  \ helplessness, the seconds of knowing there''s nothing you can do, the certainty that the ground\
  \ is waiting for you. {1}''s seen it too many times to ever risk it {4}self. "People think fear of\
  \ heights is about the fall. It''s not. It''s about the moment before - the one where you know\
  \ there''s nothing left to save you."

CLAUSTROPHOBIA.label=Fear of Enclosed Spaces
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} thrives in open terrain, where {2} can move, reposition,\
  \ and breathe. But when {2}''s forced into tight corridors, narrow tunnels, or cramped interiors,\
  \ {6} nerves start to fray. "I don''t care if it''s ''good cover'' - it''s a deathtrap. I need space to\
  \ move."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} will take the long way if it means avoiding enclosed\
  \ areas. {1} doesn''t do tunnels, small vehicles (not anymore), or tight formations. If there''s\
  \ only one exit, {2}''s already looking for another option. "One way in, one way out? Yeah, not\
  \ happening. That''s how people die."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has been stuck, buried, locked in, and {2} swore {2}''d\
  \ never let it happen again. {1}''s seen what happens when people can''t get out, heard the last\
  \ panicked breaths of those who never made it. "You don''t understand. It''s not the space. It''s\
  \ the feeling of knowing there''s no way out."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never outright says {2} has a problem, but {2}''s always\
  \ positioning {4}self near exits, keeping space between {4}self and others, and avoiding rooms\
  \ that feel too small. "I''ll stand. Don''t need to sit. Yeah, the corner''s fine. More space."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t panic, but {6} discomfort is obvious if you know\
  \ what to look for. {5} breathing changes, {6} posture stiffens, and {6} eyes keep darting to the\
  \ door. "I''m fine. Just - this place is way too small. Not a fan."
CLAUSTROPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows what it''s like to be helpless in a confined space,\
  \ unable to move, waiting for something to end {4}. {1} can still hear the echoes of those who\
  \ didn''t make it out. "I don''t do tight spaces. Ever. Because I know exactly how it ends."

AGORAPHOBIA.label=Fear of Open Spaces
AGORAPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} hates wide-open battlefields. {1} feels exposed,\
  \ vulnerable, and too easy to target. If there''s no cover, if there''s too much empty space around\
  \ {4}, {6} instincts start screaming. "You want me to stand out in the open? What, you trying to\
  \ get me killed?"
AGORAPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} isn''t afraid to fight, but {2} feels better when there''s a\
  \ ceiling over {6} head, solid walls around {4}, and nowhere for enemies to flank {4}. Wide, open\
  \ battlefields? {1}''ll take {6} chances elsewhere. "I don''t trust empty space. Too many angles,\
  \ too many places to get hit from."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen what happens when people stand out in the open.\
  \ {1}''s watched them get picked off from unseen angles, witnessed how quickly an exposed position\
  \ turns into a death sentence. Now? {1} stays where {2} can control {6} surroundings. "Out there,\
  \ you''re nothing but a target. Here? Here, at least you have a chance."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} is always near a wall, close to an exit, never lingering in\
  \ open spaces for too long. {1} doesn''t like crowds, doesn''t like too much space between {4} and\
  \ the nearest solid structure. "I''ll stand over here. Feels better this way."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t panic, but {2}''s noticeably uneasy in large, open\
  \ spaces. {1} sticks to shadows, corners, anywhere that makes the world feel smaller. "I''d rather\
  \ not stand in the middle of this room. You never know who''s watching."
AGORAPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} hates open spaces because {2} knows exactly how fast things\
  \ can go wrong when there''s no cover, no safety, nowhere to hide. {1} avoids crowds because\
  \ they''re unpredictable, uncontrollable, and just as dangerous in their own way. "Too many eyes,\
  \ too many exits, too many places to die without seeing it coming."

NYCTOPHOBIA.label=Fear of the Dark
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} fights without hesitation, moves without fear, but in\
  \ total darkness, {6} hands tighten, {6} breathing changes. {1} won''t admit it outright, but the\
  \ blackness unnerves {4}. "I don''t need night vision - I need a damn light."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t freeze in the dark - {2} moves, acts, does anything\
  \ but stand there and let the blackness settle around {4}. The quiet, the emptiness, the feeling\
  \ of not knowing what''s lurking? Unacceptable. "I''ll take an open firefight over this any day. At\
  \ least bullets don''t sneak up on you from nowhere."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows better than most that bad things happen in the\
  \ dark. {1}''s heard the screams of people who wandered too far into it, seen the bodies of those\
  \ who didn''t make it out. {1} doesn''t fear the dark itself - {2} fears what always waits inside it.\
  \ "The dark doesn''t kill you. It just hides the thing that will."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t trust dimly lit rooms. If a bulb flickers, {2}\
  \ notices immediately. If {2}''s in a dark space for too long, {2} starts looking for any excuse to\
  \ bring in more light. "No, I don''t think it''s ''cozy'' - I think it''s a goddamn liability."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} isn''t dramatic about it, but {2} won''t walk into a\
  \ pitch-black space. If someone turns off the lights too soon, {2}''s already reaching for a\
  \ flashlight. "I don''t do pitch black. Shadows? Fine. But I want to see what''s around me."
NYCTOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} has heard too many stories, seen too many things disappear\
  \ into the black and never return. {1} doesn''t fear the dark because it''s empty - {2} fears it\
  \ because {2} knows it never really is. "You don''t hear them scream. One second they''re there.\
  \ Then... nothing. That''s why I don''t go in blind."

MONOPHOBIA.label=Fear of Being Alone
MONOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} can handle gunfire, explosions, and chaos, but the second\
  \ {2}''s alone, the tension starts building. {1} checks {6} comms too often, moves faster than\
  \ necessary, like {2}''s trying to escape the silence itself. "You still there? Just - check in every\
  \ few minutes, alright?"
MONOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t do silent battlefields, abandoned locations, or\
  \ lone assignments. If {2}''s the only one left in an area, {2}''s on edge, restless, moving just to\
  \ break the quiet. "I don''t like this. Too quiet. Way too quiet."
MONOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen teammates disappear, heard allies fall silent,\
  \ felt the weight of being the last one alive. {1} doesn''t fear isolation itself - {2} fears what it\
  \ means. "The second you''re alone? That''s when you know it''s over."
MONOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t announce {6} discomfort, but {2}''s always where\
  \ people are. {1} lingers just a little longer in group settings, always finds a reason to stay\
  \ around someone. "Nah, I''m not leaving yet. Just... finishing something up."
MONOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t handle silence well. {1} fills it with casual\
  \ conversation, jokes, even pointless observations - anything to keep the emptiness from creeping\
  \ in. "Yeah, I know I talk a lot. You''d rather sit in silence?"
MONOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t afraid of solitude. {1}''s afraid of what happens to {4}\
  \ in solitude. The thoughts that come back, the ghosts that settle in, the weight of everything\
  \ {2}''s lost pressing down on {4} all at once. "You think being alone just means no one''s\
  \ around? No. It means there''s no one left."

HEMOPHOBIA.label=Fear of Blood
HEMOPHOBIA.description.0.COMBATANT={0} fights without hesitation, pushes through gunfire and\
  \ explosions, but the moment {2} sees blood - {6} or anyone else''s - {6} focus fractures. {5}\
  \ breathing changes, {6} grip tightens, and {2} forces {4}self to look anywhere else. "I''m fine. I\
  \ just - don''t ask me to look at it."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t acknowledge injuries. If someone''s hit, if\
  \ something''s bleeding, {2} focuses on everything else - the fight, the strategy, anything but the\
  \ mess pooling beneath them. "We''ll deal with it after. Just - just don''t describe it to me."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has seen blood spill in ways no one should, has watched it\
  \ drain from bodies, watched people cough it up, watched it soak into the ground like a stain\
  \ that never washes away. {1}''s lost too many people, and now the sight of it makes {6} stomach\
  \ twist. "It''s not fear. It''s knowing exactly what happens next."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.0.SUPPORT={0} winces when someone gets a paper cut, turns away if there''s\
  \ even a hint of red. {1} refuses to handle anything that involves blood and will find any excuse\
  \ to leave the room. "Nope. Not doing that. Someone else handle it."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.1.SUPPORT={0} pretends {2}''s fine, but the moment someone starts bleeding,\
  \ even slightly, {6} reaction is immediate. {5} expression tightens, {6} hands clench, and {2}\
  \ very quickly finds an excuse to be somewhere else. "Yeah, I''m good. Just - uh, I''ll be back in a\
  \ minute."
HEMOPHOBIA.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just fear blood - {2} knows what it means. {1}''s seen\
  \ people lose too much, watched them weaken, slow down, go pale. Blood isn''t just a mess - it''s a\
  \ countdown. "Blood means something went wrong. And when there''s enough of it, you already know\
  \ how the story ends."

ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.label=Fear of Zero-G
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} thrives in any environment where {2} can feel the\
  \ weight of {6} own body. But the second {2}''s in zero gravity, {2} freezes. {5} instincts fail\
  \ {4}, {6} movements feel wrong, and the lack of control sets {6} nerves on fire. "This - this\
  \ isn''t right. I can''t - I need something solid beneath me."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} hates floating. It''s not natural, not right, and\
  \ every attempt to move feels like {2}''s fighting against something invisible. {1} won''t admit it,\
  \ but the moment {2}''s in zero-G, {2} becomes a liability instead of a fighter. "I''m not scared. I\
  \ just - don''t ask me to do anything useful up here."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has been in zero-G before, and {2} hated every second\
  \ of it. No control, no weight, no sense of where danger could come from. {1}''s seen people drift\
  \ away, unable to stop themselves, watched them disappear into the black, helpless. "You lose\
  \ control up here? You don''t get it back. You just keep floating until something kills you or you\
  \ run out of air."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} actively avoids any situation that might require zero\
  \ gravity. If there''s a job that needs to be done weightless, {2}''s already volunteering someone\
  \ else. "I''ll take the next shift. On the ground. Where things stay where they''re supposed to be."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} tries to act normal, but in zero-G, {2} can''t hide {6}\
  \ discomfort. {1} moves too carefully, too rigidly, {6} body tense with every motion. "Yeah, I''m\
  \ fine. Just - I''m gonna stay right here until we''re back to normal."
ZERO_G_PARALYSIS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just dislike zero gravity - {2} fears it because\
  \ {2}''s seen what happens to people who lose control in it. {1}''s watched people flail, drift,\
  \ panic, and die without being able to do a thing about it. "On the ground, you fall. In zero-G,\
  \ you just keep going. And no one''s saving you if you go too far."

HEDONIST.label=Hedonist
HEDONIST.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t fight for honor, duty, or ideology - {2} fights because\
  \ it makes {4} feel alive. Every battle is a rush, a sensation, a fleeting moment of pure\
  \ adrenaline that nothing else can match. "You hear that? That''s the sound of life happening. And\
  \ I intend to enjoy every second of it."
HEDONIST.description.1.COMBATANT={0} never lets a win pass without making the most of it. {1}\
  \ lives fast, hard, and without restraint, because in {6} mind, there''s no point in holding back.\
  \ "We survived today? Then we drink, we feast, and we take what we can. Because tomorrow?\
  \ Tomorrow is a gamble."
HEDONIST.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has stopped believing in long-term plans, in saving up, in\
  \ waiting for better days. {1}''s seen too many people die with regrets, too many final moments\
  \ filled with ''what ifs''. {1} refuses to be one of them. "I don''t care what comes next. Right now,\
  \ I''m alive. And that means I take everything life has to offer."
HEDONIST.description.0.SUPPORT={0} isn''t one to deny {4}self pleasure, no matter how bleak things\
  \ get. If there''s good food, good drink, or something enjoyable to be had, {2}''s already\
  \ indulging. "Oh, you''re telling me I shouldn''t enjoy myself? That sounds like a you problem.
HEDONIST.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t believe in waiting for a ''better time''. {1} finds\
  \ pleasure wherever {2} can, whenever {2} can, and drags others into the fun - sometimes against\
  \ their better judgment. "You''re really gonna sit there and be miserable when you could be having\
  \ a damn good time? Come on."
HEDONIST.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just like pleasure - {2} demands it, because {2}''s seen\
  \ what happens to people who keep putting it off. {1} knows tomorrow isn''t promised, so {2} takes\
  \ everything while {2} still can. "You think we have time to waste? That we''ll all just live long\
  \ enough for a ''right moment''? No. We take what we can, while we still can."

BROADCASTS_MUSIC.label=Broadcasts Music
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} sets the mood. {5} comms are\
  \ always playing something, whether it''s dramatic orchestral scores, pounding war drums, or\
  \ completely inappropriate upbeat tunes. "If we''re going into hell, we might as well have a\
  \ killer playlist."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.COMBATANT={0} keeps {6} {8} energized and {6} enemies confused\
  \ by ensuring every engagement comes with a backing track. One moment it''s hard-hitting metal,\
  \ the next it''s a slow, eerie hum that unsettles everyone. "Oh, you don''t like my music? Guess\
  \ you better finish the fight fast then."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.COMBATANT={0} keeps the music going because without it, all that''s\
  \ left is the sound of gunfire, screams, and things {2}''d rather not remember. {1} drowns it all\
  \ out before it can creep in. "You want me to turn it off? No. I don''t do silence."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.0.SUPPORT={0}''s workspace is never quiet. Whether it''s a steady\
  \ beat, a slow melody, or something completely chaotic, there''s always some kind of sound filling\
  \ the air. "I work better with music. And you? You''ll get used to it."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t ask permission - {2} just starts playing whatever\
  \ music {2} wants, expecting everyone else to deal with it. If someone complains? {1} turns it up\
  \ just a little louder. "You''d rather sit in silence? That''s the real crime here."
BROADCASTS_MUSIC.description.2.SUPPORT={0} knows that if {2} ever lets things go silent, the\
  \ memories will start creeping back in. The people who aren''t here anymore, the things {2} should\
  \ have done differently. So the music stays on - always. "The second the music stops, that''s when\
  \ it gets bad. And I don''t plan on letting it stop."

NEMESIS.label=Has a Nemesis
NEMESIS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight - {2} fights with purpose. There''s always one\
  \ name, one face, one opponent that {2}''s constantly measuring {4}self against. Every battle is\
  \ just another step toward proving, once and for all, who''s better. "Tell me they''re here. Tell\
  \ me they showed up. I want this fight to matter."
NEMESIS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} has an personal enemy and {2} remembers every fight, every\
  \ close call, every trick {6} nemesis has ever pulled. {1} replays past encounters in {6} head,\
  \ looking for patterns, weaknesses, an edge. "Last time, they hesitated when pressured. This\
  \ time? I won''t give them the chance."
NEMESIS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} knows that most fights don''t matter, that most enemies are\
  \ just faceless obstacles. But there''s one. One that is different. One that is personal. This\
  \ rivalry is the only thing left that still feels like it has meaning. "They''ll either kill me,\
  \ or I''ll kill them. And that''s the only thing I know for sure anymore."
NEMESIS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} has one person who, for whatever reason, has become {6} eternal\
  \ competition. It might be serious, ridiculous, or entirely one-sided, but {2} refuses to back\
  \ down. "Oh, they did it first? Great. Now I have to do it better."
NEMESIS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} turns everything into a direct challenge between {4}self and\
  \ {6} nemesis. It could be work efficiency, problem-solving, or even something as simple as\
  \ making coffee - {2} must come out on top. "If they did it in five minutes, I''ll do it in four.\
  \ Watch me."
NEMESIS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just have a rival - {2} has a fixation. A constant\
  \ presence in {6} life that keeps {4} pushing forward, staying sharp, refusing to slip into\
  \ complacency. Without that challenge, {2}''s not sure {2}''d know what to do with {4}self anymore.\
  \ "Without them, I don''t know who I''d be. And that scares me more than losing."

FEAR_MEKS.label=Fear of Mek
FEAR_MEKS.description.0.COMBATANT={0} hates being near Mek, not because they''re ineffective,\
  \ but because they''re too effective. Every time {2} sees one move, {2} remembers what they leave\
  \ behind - crushed buildings, burning wreckage, bodies no one ever digs out. "You don''t pilot a\
  \ ''Mek. You unleash one. And when it moves, something always gets left in ruins."
FEAR_MEKS.description.1.COMBATANT={0} won''t touch a ''Mek unless there''s no other choice. {1}''d\
  \ rather fight on foot, in vehicles, anywhere that doesn''t feel like piloting a walking war\
  \ crime. "You ever seen a ''Mek step on a person? No? Then you don''t understand why I don''t trust\
  \ those things."
FEAR_MEKS.description.2.COMBATANT={0} has watched entire towns vanish under ''Mek fire. {1}''s seen\
  \ soldiers pulped by autocannons meant for armored targets. And the worst part? Most pilots don''t\
  \ seem to care, they just continue walking forward like nothing happened."
FEAR_MEKS.description.0.SUPPORT={0} never stands too close to a ''Mek, never trusts that they''re\
  \ fully powered down, never walks beneath one without {6} pulse spiking. They''re too big, too\
  \ unnatural, too much like monsters pretending to be machines. "I don''t care if it''s offline.\
  \ That thing''s one bad signal away from flattening this entire place."
FEAR_MEKS.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t see engineering marvels, doesn''t admire firepower or\
  \ armor plating. When {2} looks at a ''Mek, all {2} sees are crushed buildings, burning streets,\
  \ people who never had a chance to run. "You ever watch a ''Mek walk through a city? The pilot\
  \ thinks it''s just debris. I''ve seen the bodies they pull out after."
FEAR_MEKS.description.2.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just dislike Mek - {2} fears them, because {2}''s been\
  \ there when they''ve turned entire streets into craters, reduced people to nothing but a red\
  \ mist. And {2} knows they''re not done yet. "Mek don''t fight. They erase. And once they''ve\
  \ started, they don''t stop until nothing''s left."

LOCAL_CONNECTOR.label=Local Connector
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just see territory - {2} sees people. Whenever\
  \ {2}''s deployed, {2} learns the culture, the customs, the stories of those who live there. {1}\
  \ doesn''t believe in fighting blindly. "You want to survive out here? Then talk to the ones who\
  \ actually live here - they''ve been surviving longer than we have."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.COMBATANT={0} isn''t just here to fight - {2}''s here to understand. {1}\
  \ talks to locals, listens to their concerns, finds ways to work with them instead of trampling\
  \ over them. {1} knows that alliances built through respect last longer than those built through\
  \ fear. "You think we can just roll in, do our job, and leave? That''s why so many before us failed."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t trust command, strategy reports, or maps\
  \ drawn by people who have never stepped foot here. {1} trusts locals. {1} knows that understanding\
  \ them is the difference between life and death. "You ignore them, you die. It''s that simple. And\
  \ when you do, they won''t mourn you. They''ll say you deserved it."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.0.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t treat new places like temporary stops. {1}\
  \ learns the culture, the etiquette, the things outsiders usually ignore. If {2}''s going to be\
  \ somewhere new, {2}''s going to do it right. "If you don''t bother to learn how people live, don''t\
  \ be surprised when they don''t want you here."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.1.SUPPORT={0} never stays just with {6} unit - {2} integrates into local\
  \ life. {1}''ll be found talking with vendors, learning regional slang, and making {4}self at home.\
  \ "You want to know what''s really going on? Talk to the people who actually live here. Not the\
  \ ones just passing through."
LOCAL_CONNECTOR.description.2.SUPPORT={0} isn''t just curious - {2}''s calculating. {1} knows that when\
  \ things go south, it won''t be {6} team, {6} leadership, or {6} training that saves {4}. It''ll\
  \ be whether or not the locals think {2}''s worth saving. "One day, you''re going to need a favor.\
  \ And if you didn''t bother to earn their trust first, you''re not getting one."

HATRED.label=Hates the Enemy
HATRED.description.0.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t just fight against the enemy - {2} fights because of\
  \ them. Every engagement is personal, every battle another chance to wipe them from existence.\
  \ "No mercy. No second chances. If they''re standing, they''re still a threat."
HATRED.description.1.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t see gray areas or moral debates. {1} sees right and\
  \ wrong, us and them. The enemy isn''t just someone on the other side - they''re a stain that needs\
  \ to be wiped out. "I don''t want to hear about ''understanding them.'' I want to hear that they''re\
  \ dead."
HATRED.description.2.COMBATANT={0} doesn''t hate without reason. {1}''s seen the ruins, the bodies,\
  \ the aftermath of what the enemy has done. {1} doesn''t fight for glory - {2} fights for revenge.\
  \ "You don''t ''negotiate'' with butchers. You make sure they never get the chance to do it again."
HATRED.description.0.SUPPORT={0} won''t entertain conversations about why the enemy does what they\
  \ do. {1} won''t listen to sympathy, won''t engage with debate. To {4}, the only good conversation\
  \ about the enemy is one that ends with their destruction. "I don''t care about their motives. I\
  \ care about making sure they don''t walk away from this war."
HATRED.description.1.SUPPORT={0} doesn''t just oppose the enemy - {2} despises them. Any attempt at\
  \ rationalizing, debating, or finding common ground sets {4} on edge. "You think they''d show you\
  \ the same sympathy? They wouldn''t. So stop wasting your breath."
HATRED.description.2.SUPPORT={0} carries the scars of what the enemy has done. {1}''s lost too\
  \ much, seen too much, felt too much pain to ever let it go. {5} hate isn''t blind - it''s earned.\
  \ "If you knew what I knew, if you''d seen what I''ve seen, you''d hate them too. And you wouldn''t\
  \ stop until they were gone."
