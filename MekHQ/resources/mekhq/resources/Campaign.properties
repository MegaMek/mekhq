unableToEnterSystem.abandoned.ic=%s, I've spoken with the JumpShip Captain, and we've reached an impasse. They're \

unableToEnterSystem.outlawed.ic=%s, I regret to inform you that we're unable to navigate to that system. It's \
  somewhat awkward, but the system owners have taken exception to our activities and outlawed us. Maybe we should \
  travel somewhere else?
unableToEnterSystem.outlawed.ooc=Outlawing can occur as the result of supremely low Faction Standing, or accepting a \
  contract from an enemy of the system owners.

# Bioweapon Attack
bioweaponAttack.inCharacter={0}, this is an emergency.\
  <p>I''ve just confirmed the release of an engineered biological agent within the current system. Multiple \
  independent data sources verify deliberate deployment rather than accidental contamination or natural outbreak.</p>\
  <p>The agent''s characteristics indicate weaponized design. Containment is proving difficult at the planetary level, \
  and several civilian medical networks have already collapsed under response strain. Reliable epidemiological data \
  is incomplete and deteriorating as infrastructure fails.</p>\
  <p>At present, there is no verified countermeasure. Standard containment protocols have proven ineffective.</p>\
  <p>I strongly recommend immediate suspension of non-essential planetary contact. Any relaxation of these measures \
  significantly increases unit risk.</p>\
  <p>This event has strategic implications beyond medical concerns. Left unchecked, the agent could render large \
  portions of our forces nonviable over time. This appears to be the intended outcome.</p>\
  <p>I haven''t had time to check our current deployment statuses. However {0}, if we''re on a mission, it might be \
  time to back out. It''ll look bad on our record, but so will a mountain of body bags. I know you''ll do the right \
  thing.</p>
bioweaponAttack.outOfCharacter={0} has been unleashed on {1}. This is a canonical event. The effects of each \
  bioweapon vary. Some are less lethal than others. It is your decision whether to risk your command by remaining \
  planetside.\
  <p>Bioweapons are highly contagious and extremely difficult to eradicate once they infect your personnel. Unless, \
  of course, you choose <i>drastic</i> measures. The pathogen becomes inert only when the host dies. If you remain \
  planetside, your personnel <b>will</b> be infected. The only uncertainty is <i>when</i>.</p>\
  <p>A vaccine may eventually be developed to prevent further infections. It will not, however, save those who have \
  already been exposed.</p>
diseaseOutbreak.inCharacter.yesCure={0}, we are now facing a major disease outbreak within the system. Unlike previous \
  events, an effective vaccine has been developed and verified. Distribution has begun, but availability is limited \
  and local infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with demand.\
  <p>Vaccination will prevent further infections among protected personnel. It will not reverse prior exposure, and it \
  will not stabilize conditions planetside on its own. Even with a vaccine in circulation, transmission remains \
  active wherever coverage is incomplete.</p>\
  <p>If we remain in system, I strongly recommend immediate vaccination of all eligible personnel and strict control \
  of planetary access until full coverage is confirmed. Delays or partial compliance will result in avoidable \
  losses.</p>\
  <p>This vaccine changes the risk profile, not the nature of the situation. Assume the outbreak remains a live \
  threat, mitigated but not contained.</p>
diseaseOutbreak.outOfCharacter.yesCure=An outbreak of {0} has occurred on {1}. This is a canonical event. The effects\
  \ of each disease vary. Some are less lethal than others. It is your decision whether to risk your command by remaining \
  planetside.\
  <p>This disease is highly contagious and can be difficult to eradicate once it infects your personnel. Unless, \
  of course, you choose <i>drastic</i> measures. The pathogen becomes inert only when the host dies. If you remain \
  planetside, your personnel <b>will</b> be infected. The only uncertainty is <i>when</i>.</p>\
  <p>Fortunately, a vaccine has already been developed. You should go to your Infirmary and issue a Vaccine Mandate. \
  This will sure your unit is inoculated against infection.</p>
diseaseOutbreak.inCharacter.noCure={0}. we are now facing a system-wide disease outbreak with no known cure and \
  no viable vaccine. Current medical intervention is limited to containment and palliative measures. These actions \
  reduce secondary spread but do not halt the event.\
  <p>Local medical infrastructure is collapsing under sustained demand. Quarantine enforcement is inconsistent, and \
  population movement continues to undermine remaining controls. As a result, transmission is accelerating despite \
  all reasonable countermeasures.</p>\
  <p>Any continued presence in the system presents an escalating risk to our unit. Planetary operations, civilian \
  contact, and extended deployments could result in personnel losses over time. This outcome cannot be prevented, only \
  delayed.</p>\
  I must state this plainly. Withdrawal from the system is the only action that fully preserves unit readiness. \
  Remaining here converts a medical crisis into an operational one.</p>\
  <p>I will continue monitoring the situation and report immediately if conditions change. Until then, assume the \
  outbreak will worsen.</p>
diseaseOutbreak.outOfCharacter.noCure=An outbreak of {0} has occurred on {1}. This is a canonical event. The effects\
  \ of each disease vary. Some are less lethal than others. It is your decision whether to risk your command by \
  remaining planetside.\
  <p>This disease is highly contagious and can be difficult to eradicate once it infects your personnel. Unless, \
  of course, you choose <i>drastic</i> measures. The pathogen becomes inert only when the host dies. If you remain \
  planetside, your personnel <b>will</b> be infected. The only uncertainty is <i>when</i>.</p>\
  <p>Unfortunately, <b>no vaccine</b> is available at this time. It is unknown whether one will be developed and if \
  so, when.</p>
disease.newCure=A vaccine for {0} has been developed. {0} is currently active in this system.\
  <p>You are advised to issue a vaccine mandate to prevent further infections. Vaccine mandates can be issued from \
  the infirmary.</p>
