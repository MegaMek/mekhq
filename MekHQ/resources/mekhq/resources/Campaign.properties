unableToEnterSystem.abandoned.ic=%s, I've spoken with the JumpShip Captain, and we've reached an impasse. They're \
  reluctant to enter some systems on our route. I can probably turn them around, but it may require us to accept \
  additional risk. Let know what you want to do.
unableToEnterSystem.abandoned.ooc=You are attempting to draw a route to an empty system while having the 'avoid empty\
  \ systems' option enabled. Disable that option before proceeding.\
  <p>Currently, there are no penalties for entering empty systems, however this will not always be the case.</p>
unableToEnterSystem.outlawed.ic=%s, I regret to inform you that we're unable to navigate to that system. It's \
  somewhat awkward, but the system owners have taken exception to our activities and outlawed us. Maybe we should \
  travel somewhere else?
unableToEnterSystem.outlawed.ooc=Outlawing can occur as the result of supremely low Faction Standing, or accepting a \
  contract from an enemy of the system owners.
