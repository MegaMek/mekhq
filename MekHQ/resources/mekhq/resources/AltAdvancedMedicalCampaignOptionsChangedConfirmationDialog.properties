AltAdvancedMedicalCampaignOptionsChangedConfirmationDialog.description=<h1 style="text-align:center">Alternate \
  Advanced Medical (AAM)</h1>\
  You have just enabled <b>AAM</b> in a campaign that previously had it disabled. AAM uses the expanded hit \
  locations and injuries from ATOW:Companion to offer a more dynamic medical experience. It allows for prosthetics, \
  debilitating injuries, diseases, and much more. Be aware that injury times under AAM are generally longer than \
  those found under vanilla Advanced Medical. You are expected to maintain second-line forces to cycle in as your \
  A-Teams start taking injuries.\
  <p>For more information on AAM, please see the Glossary.</p>\
  <h2 style="text-align:center">Injuries</h2>\
  <p>AAM is not compatible with Total Warfare-scale 'Hits' nor vanilla Advanced Medical's injuries. It is necessary, \
  therefore, to convert those wounds into something AAM can understand. All injured characters will receive an 'Old \
  Wound' injury, in place of any Total Warfare 'Hits' or vanilla injuries. This injury will be permanent if the original\
  \ injury was also permanent. Otherwise, it will be assigned a semi-random healing time. Missing limbs, from vanilla\
  \ Advanced Medical, will be converted directly to AAM severed limbs.</p>\
  <h2 style="text-align:center">Enhanced Imaging Implants</h2>\
  <p>Under AAM (if you also have Implants enabled), ProtoMek Pilots are required to have the EI Neural Implant. \
  Affected characters can be given the implant for free. This has no effect on non-ProtoMek Pilots or in campaigns \
  where Implants are disabled.</p>
