  and Vehicle Gunners has been relaxed. This was done as part of work towards the long-requested 'Commanders Only' \
  mode. {2}'s profession now requires both gunnery and piloting skills. If the character was missing gunnery, they \
  were given gunnery for free. The level will match their piloting skill. If the character was missing piloting, they \
  were given piloting for free. The level will match their gunnery skill. If the character was missing both, they were \
  given both for free at level 3.
