SalvagePostScenarioPicker.tutorial=Below you will see a list of units that are currently available for salvage. Two \
  boxes exist for you to pick units to tow/drag, carry (in cargo), or tug (using a Naval Tug Adaptor) your salvage. \
  The rules for this can be found in <i>Campaign Operations</i>.\
  <p>Once you have arranged for salvage to be transported, you need to decide whether you want to claim it. You do so \
  by ticking one of the boxes to the left of the salvaged unit.\
  <p>The box marked with \u267B is for keeping the salvage. The other box is for selling the salvage immediately. Any\
  \ salvaged units not claimed will be given to your employer.</p>\
  <p>Note that salvage not assigned transports (via the drop-down boxes) will be abandoned to the enemy. Neither you,\
  \ nor your employer will gain access to it. As per the official rules, you only have one chance to salvage the \
  field. Any abandoned salvage will be permanently lost. The label for each item of salvage has a <b>detailed \
  tooltip</b> breaking down how long it takes to salvage.</p>
