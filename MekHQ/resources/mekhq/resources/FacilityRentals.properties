ContractStartRentalDialog.inCharacter={0}, {1} is offering us access to several support facilities under the current \
  contract. We''ve got options: extra medical bays, a full MASH unit if things get bloody, and even a connection to \
  some vetted security subcontractors.\
  <p>It''s not charity - everything comes with a monthly tag - but it could seriously lighten the load on our core \
  team. If we want in, we''ll need to commit early and stay current on payments. Miss a bill, and the whole setup gets\
  \ yanked, no questions asked.</p>
ContractStartRentalDialog.inCharacter.bay={0}, I''ve reached out to the relevant parties. We''re looking at a surcharge\
  \ of {1} C-Bills per week if we want to go ahead with this bay rental.\
  <p>Let me know if you still want to go ahead.</p>
ContractStartRentalDialog.button.confirm=Confirm
ContractStartRentalDialog.outOfCharacter.bay=Better bays allow you to perform more complex refits (as per Campaign \
  Operations, not currently enforced). They also provide reduced Target Numbers for Maintenance and Repairs.\
  <p>You can stop renting a bay at any time by moving the unit back to a repair site other than Maintenance or \
  Factory.</p>
ContractStartRentalDialog.outOfCharacter.intro=Once the contract has begun, you will be charged monthly for any \
  additional facilities you rent. If you miss a payment, you will permanently lose access to these resources. You \
  will be warned if this is in danger of occurring.
ContractStartRentalDialog.outOfCharacter.hospitals=<p>Each MASH Facility rented will cost {0} C-Bills per month and \
  provide <b>25</b> additional MASH capacity. This only has a mechanical effect if the tracking of MASH Theaters is \
  enabled in Campaign Options.</p>
ContractStartRentalDialog.outOfCharacter.kitchens=<p>Each Kitchen Facility rented will cost {0} C-Bills per month and\
  \ provide <b>150</b> additional Field Kitchen capacity. This only has a mechanical effect if the tracking of Fatigue \
  is enabled in Campaign Options.</p>
ContractStartRentalDialog.outOfCharacter.security=<p>Each Security Subcontract negotiated will cost {0} C-Bills per \
  month and provide <b>35</b> additional Prisoner Capacity. This only has a mechanic effect if the tracking of \
  Prisoners of War is enabled in Campaign Options.</p>
