  <p>Following a comprehensive review of your recent operational history, the General Command Office has concluded \
  that your continued presence within the active duty structure of <b>{19}</b> is no longer tenable.</p>\
  <p>Your repeated failures in the field have placed strategic assets at risk and eroded confidence in the command \
  hierarchy. As such, you are hereby directed to accept immediate retirement, with no option for reassignment or \
  appeal.</p>\
  <p>All rank and associated command authority are revoked upon delivery of this notice. You are entitled to standard\
  \ retirement benefits in accordance with <b>{19}</b> military code.</p>\
  <p>Service in the <b>{19}</b> Armed Forces is a privilege earned through performance. When that performance fails,\
  \ so too must the privilege be withdrawn.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.periphery={0},\
  <p>Your leadership of <b>{18}</b> has been reviewed following multiple operational failures that have directly\
  \ undermined the security and stability of <b>{19}</b>. In a nation of our size, such outcomes cannot be \
  tolerated.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, you are to accept mandatory retirement, thereby removing your name from the active chain \
  of command. This decision is final. It ensures that our forces can rebuild trust, regain cohesion, and refocus on \
  the defense of our people.</p>\
  <p>You will retain eligibility for veteran benefits and will be provided with a modest residence and stipend \
  appropriate to your service. These provisions are extended in recognition of your past sacrifices, but do not imply\
  \ ongoing trust or authority.</p>\
  <p><b>{19}</b> cannot afford weak links. This retirement preserves what remains of our strength.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.CC={0},\
  <p>The Capellan Confederation recognizes long-standing service, and we remain grateful to all who have committed \
  themselves to the defense of the State. It is in this spirit that we extend to you a transition opportunity that \
  will allow your experience to serve the Confederation in a more stable and structured capacity.</p>\
  <p>Following repeated reviews of your recent field deployments, the Ministry of Defense has determined that your \
  present command posture no longer aligns with current strategic expectations. This assessment reflects not ill \
  intent, but a necessary recalibration in the interest of broader national security.</p>\
  <p>You are therefore directed to accept reassignment to Strategic Reserve Status, effective immediately. This role \
  carries no field responsibilities but preserves your record, benefits, and standing. It is the considered position \
  of this office that acceptance of this transition will demonstrate continued loyalty and ideological clarity - both \
  of which are monitored with great interest in today''s environment.</p>\
  <p>There is no dishonor in stepping aside when the State requires it. There is, however, concern when such requests\
  \ are resisted.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.DC={0},\
  <p>The Dragon expects absolute devotion, but it also demands that honor be maintained, even in failure. Your recent\
  \ actions in the field have been reviewed. The conclusions are clear. Continuation of your command would invite \
  greater scrutiny, not only upon you, but upon the legacy of your family.</p>\
  <p>The Coordinator''s wisdom grants you a final opportunity: to step aside with dignity, to enter retirement \
  quietly, and to protect what can still be preserved. This transition is not a punishment. It is a gesture of \
  restraint - for your name, and for your ancestors who once served more ably than you have.</p>\
  <p>You are hereby directed to accept immediate retirement from active duty. Your service record will remain sealed \
  to the public. No formal dishonor will be attached to your name, provided you comply without hesitation.</p>\
  <p>The Dragon sees all. It remembers not only your deeds but your choices. Leave now, and let your name speak of \
  silence rather than shame.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.LA={0},\
  <p>After a thorough performance review and in consultation with the Regional Command Board, it has been determined \
  that your continued presence in the active command structure is no longer conducive to the operational goals of the\
  \ Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces.</p>\
  <p>While we appreciate the unique circumstances under which your commission was originally acquired, such \
  appointments must still meet the demands of the field. Recent outcomes have made it clear that such demands have, \
  regrettably, not been met.</p>\
  <p>To preserve institutional integrity - and to ensure that personnel placement is aligned with meritocratic \
  expectations - you are advised to accept voluntary retirement, effective immediately. This course of action will \
  allow you to retain pension rights, social standing and will prevent the need for more formal inquiry into \
  <b>{18}</b>'' performance metrics.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.FS={0},\
  <p>Service in the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns is a calling - an act of faith in the ideals of freedom, \
  justice, and duty. Those who accept that burden are expected to rise to the standard set by generations of officers\
  \ before them. Unfortunately, recent assessments of your field performance indicate that standard has not been \
  met.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have faced a string of setbacks and failures that cannot be ignored. We recognize the \
  complexities of command, but the outcome remains the same: operational underperformance that places mission \
  integrity and the reputation of our forces at risk.</p>\
  <p>To that end, and in the interest of preserving both your dignity and the public''s confidence in the Armed \
  Forces, you are hereby encouraged to accept honorable retirement, effective immediately. This path ensures your \
  record closes with decorum and prevents further embarrassment to the service you once swore to uphold.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Suns remains grateful for those who try. But we must be led by those who succeed.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.FWL={0},\
  <p>In light of recent evaluations conducted by the Joint Provincial Oversight Board and at the recommendation of \
  multiple member-state defense representatives, the Ministry has determined that your current role within the Free \
  Worlds League Military is best concluded through a strategic transition to retirement status.</p>\
  <p>This recommendation is not solely a reflection of battlefield performance - though that record, as reviewed, \
  raises valid questions - but rather a product of evolving priorities within the interprovincial command structure. \
  As you are well aware, cohesion and political alignment are as vital to stability as tactical efficiency.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are requested to accept retirement with honors, effective immediately. This transition \
  ensures continued access to your benefits and precludes the need for further review by any standing committees or \
  oversight panels. It is, we believe, the most prudent course for all parties involved.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.TH={0},\
  <p>The Terran Hegemony maintains the highest standards of operational integrity, not only for the sake of military \
  effectiveness, but because each officer bears the symbolic weight of our civilization''s legacy. As such, continued \
  service is a privilege contingent on performance, conduct, and public confidence.</p>\
  <p>Following an internal audit and review of recent field deployments under your command, the Strategic Conduct \
  Board has concluded that your continued visibility within the active forces presents an unnecessary reputational \
  risk to the Hegemony''s unified image.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are directed to accept immediate retirement from all active duties. This transition will \
  preserve your benefits, minimize external scrutiny, and ensure your name is recorded with due dignity. We expect \
  you to understand the value of this path and the discretion it affords.</p>\
  <p>The Hegemony does not fail. It adjusts. Quietly, and without spectacle.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.ROS={0},\
  <p>The Republic was founded upon the belief that strength does not come from domination, but from unity. Every \
  citizen, every soldier, and every commander contributes to that unity - not just through battle, but through \
  discipline, responsibility, and trust.</p>\
  <p>After a comprehensive review of your recent command history, the Unified Command Council has determined that \
  your continued service in an active operational role no longer aligns with the expectations and needs of the \
  Republic Armed Forces. This decision is not taken lightly. It reflects neither condemnation nor dishonor, but \
  rather a call to protect the harmony we have all sworn to uphold.</p>\
  <p>You are therefore directed to accept honorable retirement, effective immediately. This transition will be \
  conducted with the utmost respect for your prior service, and with full recognition of your contributions. It is \
  the firm recommendation of this office that you embrace this course - not only for your own legacy, but for the \
  continued cohesion of the Republic''s military structure.</p>

  <p>The Star League Defense Force is entrusted with a solemn duty: to uphold the peace, order, and unity of the \
  Inner Sphere. Every officer bears that burden not as an individual but as a representative of the ideals we \
  defend.</p>\
  <p>Following a formal evaluation by the Personnel Review Directorate, it has been determined that your recent \
  performance in the field does not meet the standards required of SLDF command personnel. The cumulative impact of \
  these operational shortcomings compels us to take corrective action in service to institutional integrity.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, you are directed to enter mandatory retirement. This action preserves the dignity of your\
  \ service and removes the need for formal disciplinary proceedings. You will retain all honors accrued and are \
  expected to conduct yourself henceforth with the decorum befitting a former officer of the League.</p>\
  <p>The Star League endures through order, not sentiment. When service becomes strain, honor lies in stepping \
  aside.</em></p>

  <p>The Federated Commonwealth relies on the capability and professionalism of its officers to represent the \
  strength and unity of our combined legacy. Each command role is a position of trust, requiring not only loyalty, \
  but competence and consistency in the field.</p>\
  <p>Following an operational review of your command record, the General Staff has concluded that your recent \
  performance does not align with the expectations of active-duty leadership. While your service is noted, the \
  present trajectory of your command leaves no viable path for continued assignment at this level.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are to accept immediate retirement from active duty. Your transition will be conducted with \
  full honors and administrative support. This course of action is final, and no alternate posting will be \
  considered.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Commonwealth must be led by those who meet its demands. Stepping aside with dignity is, itself, a \
  service to the realm.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.RWR={0},\
  <p>The Republic values discretion, continuity, and loyalty. While outcomes in the field have been less than ideal, \
  we understand that certain burdens are not always carried gracefully. What matters now is that we resolve this \
  situation in a manner that reflects well on all involved.</p>\
  <p>Following an internal consensus review, it has been determined that your continued presence in uniform no longer\
  \ serves the Republic''s interests. To preserve institutional harmony and ensure no further complications arise, you\
  \ are hereby instructed to accept immediate retirement - effective without delay.</p>\
  <p>This transition will include a generous relocation package, housing allowance, and severance bonus. Declining \
  this arrangement is strongly discouraged, as it would place undue stress on the Office of Stability''s mandate to \
  maintain operational coherence... and you wouldn''t want to do that.</p>\

  <p>Service in the Taurian Defense Force is not given - it is earned. And it is judged not by titles or promises, \
  but by action in the field and the trust of the people we defend. That trust has limits.</p>\
  <p>After careful review of your recent operational record, it is the decision of this command that your continued \
  presence in an active role compromises the effectiveness and cohesion of our forces. In light of this, you are \
  directed to accept mandatory retirement, effective immediately.</p>\
  <p>This decision preserves your record from further scrutiny and allows the Concordat to redirect its resources \
  toward personnel who are ready to shoulder the burden of our defense.</p>\
  <p>We fight not for glory or ambition, but because no one else will. If you cannot hold that line, then you must \
  step away from it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.MOC={0},\
  <p>In the Magistracy Armed Forces, we believe that every individual who steps forward to serve deserves both \
  respect and support - whether they continue in uniform or step away from the line.</p>\
  <p>After a careful and measured review of your recent performance and its impact on operational outcomes, the \
  Personnel Affairs Board has determined that the most appropriate course of action is for you to accept retirement \
  with full honors and benefits, effective immediately.</p>\
  <p>This is not a punitive decision, but a preventative one - designed to preserve your personal well-being, protect\
  \ the stability of the forces under your former command, and allow you the space to reinvest in your future beyond\
  active service.</p>\
  <p>You will retain access to medical care, housing stipends, and vocational transition programs through the \
  Canopian Veteran Welfare Bureau. Additional accommodations may be arranged based on your preferences for \
  post-service placement.</p>\

  <p>The Outworlds Alliance stands apart not because we are weak, but because we choose to act with restraint where \

  <p>Reports from your recent operations have raised questions that cannot be ignored. While full inquiry is neither \
  desired nor politically viable, it is clear that your methods have placed the Alliance in a compromised position - \
  one that contradicts the values we are sworn to uphold, and the trust our citizens place in us.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are directed to accept immediate retirement, effective upon receipt of this notice. This \
  decision will shield both your record and the integrity of the Alliance Military Corps from further scrutiny. You \
  will be granted full pension rights and relocation options under sealed terms.</p>\

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.MH={0},\
  <p>Your record has been reviewed by the Senate, and the judgment is clear: your command of <b>{18}</b> has \

  have cost the Hegemony both resources and reputation.</p>\
  <p>By standard measure, your failures would merit public execution. That you are reading this message is a result \
  of intervention by a patron within the upper ranks - one who evidently still sees some value in preserving your \
  miserable life.</p>\
  <p>As such, you are hereby granted forced retirement, effective immediately. You are stripped of rank, denied the \
  right to command, and reassigned to non-combatant veteran status under surveillance. Do not mistake this as a \

  <p>In the cycles of duty, there are moments when it becomes clear that further advancement does not serve the \

  <p>Accordingly, by directive of the First Circuit, your current assignments are hereby concluded, and you are \
  reassigned to a position of meditative doctrinal study within the Third Sphere of Internal Reflection at the Gibson\

  <p>This transition is not disciplinary. It is a realignment of purpose - an invitation to reattune your thoughts \
  with the clarity of Blake''s teachings, and to contemplate the intersections between will, result, and sanctified \
  intent. The silence of service often speaks more purely than the chaos of command.</p>\
  <p>Accept this assignment with humility. Resist, and the Word will interpret resistance accordingly.</p>\
  <p>Blake illuminates the path. Not all are meant to walk at the front.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.WOB={0},\
  <p>The Word sees all outcomes as reflections of intent. And where intent has strayed - whether by ignorance, \
  fatigue, or willful deviation - there must be redress. Your recent field performance reveals troubling divergences \
  from the divine clarity of Blake''s design.</p>\
  <p>As such, by the judgment of the Inner Sanctum, you are hereby invited to permanent doctrinal reassignment at a \
  Reeducation and Realignment Facility. You will report without delay. All material possessions and identifiers are \
  to be surrendered upon entry. Further communication with the outside is neither necessary nor permitted.</p>\
  <p>This is not exile. This is purification. You are not cast out, you are brought inward - to confront the flawed \
  patterns of your former self and allow Blake''s truth to burn away what remains impure.</p>\
  <p>The faithful are not abandoned. They are re-formed - until only faith remains.</p>

  \ of Battle Act.</p>\
  <p>This decision follows a full review conducted by the operational auditors and confirmed by the Department of  \
  Strategic Readiness. Multiple engagements under your command have resulted in avoidable losses, breakdowns in \
  leadership structure, and deviation from standard AFFS combat protocols. Despite repeated opportunities for course \
  correction, the unit has failed to reestablish effectiveness in the field.</p>\
  <p>Let me be clear - this is not a judgment of character, but a necessary action in defense of the greater mission. \
  Our enemies do not rest, and we cannot afford to carry liabilities into battle.</p>\
  <p>All personnel under your command will be reassigned based on individual performance records. You are relieved of\
  \ duty and are to report to the regional Command Review Office for exit processing and formal debrief.</p>

  <p>By joint resolution of the Defense Subcommittee on Interprovincial Asset Management and the Military Oversight \
  Board, your unit - <b>{18}</b> - is hereby disbanded and removed from recognized command structures \
  within the Free Worlds League Military.</p>\
  <p>This decision reflects recent findings regarding repeated tactical inefficiencies during your recent deployments\
  \ in contested zones. While performance metrics have informed the final recommendation, it is also noted that your \
  command structure no longer aligns with the current strategic integration model endorsed by the Parliament''s \
  Military Appropriations Coalition.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>'' unique charter, originally backed by external provincial funding, has been reviewed and voided\
  \ under Section 43B of the Revised Unit Endowment Statutes. Consequently, further retention of your command \
  presents a redundancy in both budgetary terms and strategic value. Military necessity and political consensus are, \
  in this case, aligned.</p>\
  <p>All subordinate personnel will be redistributed in accordance with their province of origin, pending standard \
  reassessment. You are instructed to report to the regional audit office on Oriente for final clearance.</p>

  <p>Following a comprehensive performance review conducted by the Office of Systems Analysis and approved by the \

  dissolved as of this transmission.</p>\
  <p>The decision is based on a pattern of inefficiency, unacceptable asset attrition rates, and repeated deviation \
  from standardized operational parameters during recent campaigns. It is the position of this office that your unit \
  no longer satisfies the qualitative or strategic benchmarks mandated by the Terran Hegemony Armed Forces.</p>\
  <p>Be advised: this determination is not punitive. It is procedural. The Hegemony does not sustain failed models. \

  <p>In the Outworlds Alliance, military command is not a path to power, but a burden borne for the safety and \
  conscience of our people. When that burden is mishandled, it endangers not only lives, but the ethical foundation \
  upon which we stand.</p>\
  <p>Your recent decisions in the field - marked by excess, disorganization, and disregard for proportional \
  response - have raised concern within the Corps. This letter serves as a formal warning that continued failure to \
  uphold the principles and performance expected of your post will result in disciplinary action or removal from \
  command.</p>\
  <p>"Power without restraint is not order - it is the seed of collapse."</p>\
  <p>Consider this your opportunity to reflect, refocus, and re-earn the trust placed in you - not just by superiors, \
  but by the people who believe in what we stand for.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.FORMAL_WARNING.MH={0},\
  <p>Let us speak plainly: your failures on the battlefield dishonor the legions, embarrass your superiors, and chip \
  away at the strength of the Hegemony with every step you take in uniform. You were given command. You returned \
  shame.</p>\
  <p>This is your final warning. Any further display of incompetence, hesitation, or lack of resolve will be met not \
  with review, not with reassignment - but with action. The kind that does not involve paperwork.</p>\
  <p>You are being watched. Closely. Do better, or disappear. There will be no third notice. The Caesar tolerates \
  many things. Weakness is not one of them.</p>

  <p>It is with measured concern that we bring to your attention a pattern of field outcomes under your stewardship \
  that diverge from the order and clarity expected of those entrusted with ComStar''s banner.</p>\
  <p>Such outcomes do not yet warrant censure, but they must not continue. You are therefore advised to treat this \
  communication as a formal warning, and an opportunity for self-correction under the guidance of the Blessed Word.</p>\
  <p>We encourage you to revisit the Writings of Blake - particularly the passages on the burdens of leadership and the\
  \ necessity of inner balance in times of worldly disorder. In the silence of scripture, the path forward is often \
  made clear.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.FORMAL_WARNING.WOB={0},\
  <p>The Word does not waver. The Word does not stumble. And yet, your recent performance suggests a troubling \
  inconsistency with both the expectations of your command and the purity of your commitment to Blake''s great \
  design.</p>\
  <p>This message is to be regarded as a formal warning. You are instructed to begin immediate reflection upon your \
  recent actions, their consequences, and the degree to which they align with your sworn devotion to the cause. \
  Repeated failure is not merely error - it is dissonance. And dissonance is the first note of heresy.</p>\
  <p>Do not look outward for excuses. Look inward for truth. The Inner Sanctum is observing.</p>\

  complaints regarding <b>{18}</b>'' recent performance - missed objectives, collateral damage, and client \
  dissatisfaction chief among them.</p>\
  <p>While no formal charges have been filed yet, the volume and consistency of the reports suggest that legal action\

  <p>We''re giving you a heads-up, because once it goes formal, it gets expensive, fast. Arbitrators get involved. \
  Accounts get slapped. Reputations don''t recover easy from that kind of hit.</p>\

  <p>This message is a transactional courtesy. We advise immediate corrective measures to preserve your contract \

  <p>These failures have undermined trust in our forces, weakened our deterrent posture, and exposed us to threats we\

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.periphery=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p><b>{19}</b> cannot survive on goodwill or hope. Its defense rests on a single truth: our commanders must \
  deliver strength, or we fail as a state.</p>\
  <p>Your unit - <b>{18}</b> - has, across multiple leadership changes and missions, failed us. This isn''t \
  merely underperformance. This is institutional collapse, playing out in front of soldiers and civilians alike.</p>\
  <p>Such a collapse feeds fear, weakens resolve, and invites exploitation. Neighboring states, mercenary bands, and \
  internal actors are already watching, waiting for signs of weakness - and you have given them proof.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, all senior leadership within <b>{18}</b> is relieved of command. New \

  <p>In <b>{19}</b>, leadership is the thin line between survival and chaos. As you have failed to hold it. We will \
  appoint those who can.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.clan=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>You have brought shame to <b>{19}</b> beyond measure. Your every engagement - botched. Your every command - \

  <p>This is not failure. This is betrayal through mediocrity. Despite changes in command, despite repeated \

  You will speak no words in protest. You will offer no resistance. You are not warriors. You are tolerated \

  <p>This message is issued under directive from the Ministry of Defense and reviewed by internal agents of the \
  Maskirovka. It concerns your collective and ongoing failure to meet the minimum expectations of service to the \

  <p>Your unit has cycled through commanders, adjusted operational parameters, and received logistical priority - and \

  <p>Effective immediately, the entire senior leadership cadre of <b>{18}</b> is hereby relieved of command. No \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.DC=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>You were given the honor of command under the Dragon''s gaze. In return, you have delivered disorder, disgrace, \
  and defeat. Across multiple commanders and campaigns, <b>{18}</b> have demonstrated not growth, but rot. This \
  is no longer a matter of individual failure. It is a failure of spirit - collective and unforgivable.</p>\
  <p>Your conduct reflects not simply incompetence, but contempt for the legacy of warriors who served before you. \
  You have made yourselves a blemish on the Combine''s history. You have brought shame to your banners. You have \
  dishonored the Dragon.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire leadership structure of <b>{18}</b> is dissolved. All command rights are \
  revoked. You will surrender authority to the incoming officers designated by the Gunji-no-Kanrei. Resistance will \

  <p>Let me be absolutely clear: this is no longer about the shortcomings of any one {22}. The entire senior \
  leadership of your unit has demonstrated a staggering inability to adapt, coordinate, or even communicate basic \
  operational priorities. This goes beyond disappointment - it is strategic liability.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire command echelon of <b>{18}</b> is relieved of duty. New leadership will \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.FS=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The Federated Suns cannot afford to carry dead weight in wartime - and yet, despite repeated interventions, your \

  <p><b>{18}</b> have moved from underperformance to operational liability. This is no longer about individual \
  failures - this is about a command structure that either refuses or is incapable of doing its duty.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, all senior leadership within <b>{18}</b> is removed from command. You will stand \
  down and comply with transition orders issued by the General Staff. Noncompliance will be met with military \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.FWL=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The consequences of your persistent failures have now extended beyond the battlefield and into the halls of \
  Parliament. Following your latest operational collapse, Delegate Arlen Vos - who publicly vouched for your unit''s \
  strategic value - has lost his seat in a no-confidence vote. The fallout from your performance has damaged more than \
  military credibility; it has cost political capital we cannot afford to lose.</p>\
  <p>This pattern of dysfunction has persisted across multiple commanders. The implication is now clear: the rot is \
  systemic. No more hearings. No more oversight reviews. No more second chances.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entirety of <b>{18}</b>'' senior leadership is stripped of command. New \
  leadership, drawn from League-vetted forces, will assume control without delay. You will comply. This is not a \

  <p>The Free Worlds League is a federation, not a charity. You''ve humiliated those who stood for you. This is the \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.TH=<p>To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b></p>\
  <p>The Terran Hegemony projects leadership, excellence, and stability across the Inner Sphere. That projection \
  begins with results - and you have failed to deliver them.</p>\
  <p>Despite changes in command, reallocation of elite support, and repeated directives, <b>{18}</b> remain \
  operationally stagnant and tactically inept. At this point, your failures no longer raise questions about \
  competence - they raise questions about the judgment of those who allowed this unit to persist.</p>\
  <p>When a Terra-based command structure produces this level of visible failure, it weakens the very doctrine that \
  underpins our strategic posture. That is unacceptable.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the full leadership of <b>{18}</b> is removed. Replacement officers - vetted by \
  Central Strategic Authority - are en route. You will stand down and comply with full procedural transition. This unit\
  \ will no longer be permitted to undermine the reputation of Terra through incompetence masquerading as loyalty.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.ROS=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The Republic of the Sphere was built to be more than a successor state - it was meant to be a foundation for \
  lasting peace and stability. Every military unit in our service is expected to embody those values, not erode \
  them.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have failed in that responsibility. Across multiple commanders and operational cycles, your \
  unit has consistently fallen short of expectations. Tactical cohesion is nonexistent. Morale is fractured. Results \
  are indefensible. This failure has persisted despite intervention, oversight, and restructuring efforts.</p>\
  <p>At this point, it is not one officer under review - it is a failed culture. And the Republic cannot afford that \
  kind of rot in its command structure.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire senior leadership of <b>{18}</b> is relieved of duty. New command \
  personnel have been dispatched with full authority to assume control. You are to cooperate fully with all \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.SL=<p>To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b></p>\
  <p>The Star League Defense Force was created to serve as a bulwark against division, instability, and chaos. Your \
  continued failures have served the opposite purpose.</p>\
  <p>Despite changes in leadership, operational reviews, and command interventions, <b>{18}</b> have \
  consistently demonstrated a lack of tactical discipline, unit cohesion, and battlefield results. This is no longer \
  a matter of internal reform - it is a liability to broader League security.</p>\
  <p>Every time your unit falters, it strengthens the will of those watching from the fringes - pirates, warlords, and \
  dissident states in the periphery who see weakness not as an error, but as an invitation. The wolves on the border \

  <p>Effective immediately, all senior officers assigned to <b>{18}</b> are relieved of command. New leadership,\

  <p><b>{18}</b> have cycled through commanders, absorbed resources, and been afforded latitude that would break\

  <p><b>{18}</b> have squandered resources, lost face, and - most importantly - raised doubts about where their \

  <p>Effective immediately, every officer holding command within <b>{18}</b> is relieved. You will be replaced \
  with personnel whose loyalty and results are not in question. Their names are already known. Your relevance is \

  <p>You are to stand down, surrender all clearances, and await further instructions. Resistance will be interpreted \

  <p>Every failed deployment, every missed objective, weakens the line that protects us from exploitation and \

  <p><b>{18}</b> have, time and again, failed to meet those expectations. Despite changes in leadership and \

  <p>It is the judgment of this Office, under guidance from the First Circuit, that the continued operational \

## APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES
### messages
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.innerSphere={22}, our unit''s been flagged in recent data requests \
  traced back to <b>{19}</b>''s internal military and administrative systems. From what I can tell, this is tied directly to \
  our support operations in the region.\
  <p>They''re impressed. We''ve earned a reputation within as a dependable and capable presence, and it looks like \
  their command structure is starting to take us seriously.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep the pressure steady and the results clean. They could become a useful ally - or at the very least, a \
  friendly DropPort.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CC={22}, our unit has shown up in several high-level search logs \
  from within the Confederation''s military command structure. It''s clear we''ve attracted attention from above.\
  <p>That could mean opportunity - or increased scrutiny. Either way, we need to stay sharp and keep our record clean. \
  The Chancellor doesn''t watch casually.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.DC={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls \
  originating from Combine High Command. We are being observed.\
  <p>This is not unexpected, given our recent record. Recognition from above is earned - but it also brings increased \
  expectations. The Dragon does not reward lightly, nor forgive failure.</p>\
  <p>I recommend we operate with absolute precision. Now is the time to prove we are worthy of the attention we''ve \
  drawn.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.LA={22}, I ran a routine systems check and found that our unit''s \
  name has come up in several flagged searches from LCAF senior staff. We''ve clearly landed on someone''s radar.\
  <p>Given our recent performance, I''d say this is the start of something bigger - assignments, evaluations, maybe even \
  patronage. Of course, it also means we''ll be under closer scrutiny.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure what they see keeps us moving up, not sideways.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FS={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent searches coming out \
  of Federated Suns High Command. It looks like we''ve drawn attention from above.\
  <p>Given how we''ve been performing, it''s not a surprise - but it is a responsibility. They''re watching now, and that \
  means every move counts more than ever.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep showing them that their trust - or curiosity - is well-placed.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FWL={22}, I''ve reviewed recent network activity, and our unit has \
  been flagged in multiple search queries from different branches of League command. We''re on the radar now - possibly \
  in more than one bloc.\
  <p>That could open doors, or it could mean someone''s sizing us up. Either way, we should stay sharp and keep our \
  profile clean. In the League, attention from above can shift quickly - best we guide it, not chase it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TH={22}, our unit has been flagged in multiple high-clearance \
  search protocols traced back to Hegemony Command. We''re officially on their watchlist - likely under performance review.\
  <p>This isn''t cause for concern - yet. It''s a signal that our actions are aligning with greater strategic interests. In\
  \ the Hegemony, recognition from above often precedes increased expectations.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure we continue to operate in a way that honors the legacy we represent.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ROS={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent search activity \
  originating from upper echelons of Republic Command. We''re clearly under review - most likely due to our recent field\
  \ performance.\
  <p>This kind of attention could lead to expanded responsibilities. It also means we''ll be held to a higher standard \
  from here on out.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure we continue to reflect the values this Republic was built on - stability, integrity, and trust.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.SL={22}, our unit has been flagged in multiple search queries \
  issued by central Star League command. We appear to be under observation by higher strategic authorities.\
  <p>This likely reflects our operational record to date - and signals that we may be considered for more critical \
  assignments. The League does not act without purpose.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure that everything we do from this point forward upholds the ideals we serve: unity, order, and the \
  preservation of peace.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FC={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls from the \
  Federated Commonwealth''s joint command systems. We''ve drawn the eye of higher leadership - likely in recognition of \
  our recent actions.\
  <p>That kind of visibility comes with opportunity - and scrutiny. Let''s stay focused and disciplined. If we''re being \
  watched, let''s give them something worth backing.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.periphery={22}, we''ve been flagged in a string of intel queries \
  coming from inside <b>{19}</b> - government channels, militia databases, even administrative logs. From the look of it, word \
  of our recent actions on their behalf is spreading fast.\
  <p>They''re watching us now, not as a threat, but as an asset. A force that gets results.</p>\
  <p>Might be worth leaning into that. Relationships like this don''t happen often out here - and when they do, they \
  can pay off in ways C-Bills can''t.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.RWR={22}, our unit has appeared in recent search activity \
  originating from Rim Worlds central authority. We''ve drawn attention from the upper chain - possibly the Directorate \
  itself.\
  <p>This could mean recognition. It could also mean evaluation. Either way, we continue forward with \
  discipline and absolute alignment to the Republic''s vision.</p>\
  <p>Stay sharp. In the Republic, attention is never neutral.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TC={22}, our unit''s been flagged in recent searches by senior \
  Concordat defense officials. Word''s gotten around - we''ve made an impression.\
  <p>That kind of attention can mean trust, or testing. Either way, it''s on us to show we''re worth the faith. Let''s \
  keep doing what we''ve been doing - clean, solid work that speaks louder than promises ever could.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MOC={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent strategic reviews \
  coming out of Magistracy high command. It''s clear we''ve attracted some attention - likely due to our recent \
  effectiveness.\
  <p>This kind of visibility tends to lead somewhere - contracts, evaluations, or possibly an invitation. Let''s make \
  sure what they see reinforces the value we bring to the Magistrix.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.OA={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent inquiry records from \
  Outworlds Alliance command. We''ve drawn some attention - likely from the Council''s strategic oversight division.\
  <p>It''s not something they do lightly. That kind of interest means they''re watching what we''re building out here - and \
  weighing what more we could take on.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep our operations clean, precise, and true to the Alliance''s values. We didn''t ask for this attention, \
  but we''ve earned it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MH={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent data sweeps from \
  upper-tier command in the Marian Hegemony. Word is, someone close to the Caesar''s circle is watching.\
  <p>This isn''t the kind of attention we can afford to waste. Recognition here means expectation - of strength, of \
  discipline, of results. Let''s give them exactly that.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CS={22}, our unit has been referenced in several flagged \
  information queries originating from within ComStar. The nature of the searches was...specific, and they weren''t \
  routed through public channels.\
  <p>This isn''t casual interest. The Order is aware of us - and watching.</p>\
  <p>We should proceed with caution. When ComStar looks too closely, it''s rarely just to admire the work.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.WOB={22}, our unit has appeared in recent searches traced back to \
  Word of Blake enclaves - specifically the inner doctrinal networks. The kind they don''t access without purpose.\
  <p>It''s not praise. It''s prophecy. They believe we''ve aligned with the Pattern... or that we might disrupt it.</p>\
  <p>Either way, the True Believers are looking at us now. Best we stay sharp, stay moving, and remember - attention \
  from the Word rarely ends with just observation.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.clan={22}, our unit has been marked in recent internal Watch \
  searches - originating from senior <b>{19}</b> command. They are watching us.\
  <p>This is not flattery. It is evaluation. Attention in the Clans is never casual - it is earned or it is provoked.</p>\
  <p>We must continue to operate with strength, clarity, and discipline. If they are measuring us, then let them find \
  proof of worth, not weakness.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MG={22}, we''ve just received notice from the Mercenary Guild:\
  \ <b>{18}</b> are being listed by name in contract queries. Not general mercenary requests - direct tags.\
  <p>That means one thing: someone out there isn''t looking for just warm bodies with guns. They want us. \
  Specifically.</p>\
  <p>This kind of visibility cuts both ways. On the one hand, it means our reputation''s finally putting weight on the \
  board - word of our ops is circulating, and somebody with clout took notice. Could be a payout worth chasing.</p>\
  <p>But it also means we''ve lost some of our anonymity. If we''re being shopped by name, we''re on more than one \
  radar now. That opens the door to targeted offers - but also tailored threats. Rival outfits, old enemies, or \
  clients with long memories might start circling.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRB={0}, we''ve received an official communication from ComStar''s \
  Mercenary Review Board. Not a general bulletin - a direct transmission.\
  <p>No contract attached, no details on who initiated the flag. Just a short-form notice confirming that our unit file\
  \ has been "accessed and reviewed by multiple parties with high-clearance contracting authority." ComStar doesn''t \
  name names, but the implication is clear: someone''s vetting us at a high level, and they''re doing it through \
  official channels.</p>\
  <p>That makes this bigger than a backroom employer or an informal probe. We''re on someone''s shortlist for serious \
  work - possibly House-level or black-budget operations. Could mean money and visibility, but also means we''re about \
  to be in someone else''s game.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRBC={22}, we''ve been contacted by the Mercenary Review and \
  Bonding Commission.\
  <p>Not standard formwork. This came encrypted, authenticated, and flagged priority. They''ve officially acknowledged \
  <b>{18}</b> as a unit of interest, citing "notable performance in recent operations and consistent contract \
  integrity." Translation: Wolf''s Dragoons have been watching us, and they like what they see - enough to reach out \
  directly.</p>\
  <p>No contracts attached - yet - but the MRBC doesn''t waste its breath. This feels like the start of something heavier.\
  \ Possibly front-door access to higher-grade assignments or even MRBC-coordinated deployments.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MBA={22}, we''ve been formally contacted by the Mercenary \
  Bonding Authority, the one operated by Clan Sea Fox.\
  <p>Encrypted message, trinary-coded, and backed by a verified merchant caste credential. Not your standard \
  transmission. The content was characteristically precise: <b>{18}</b> have been "flagged for strategic market \
  alignment and performance-based evaluation."</p>\
  <p>They''re not just watching us. They''re weighing us - as an asset. And with the Sea Foxes, that means they see \
  value - either as a sellable brand, a deployable asset, or something worth franchising. The line between recognition \
  and acquisition is thin with them.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.PSI={22}, we''ve been tipped off - locals are getting \
  twitchy. Every time we jump into a system, militias go to alert within hours. Some are looking for us before we \
  even touch ground.\
  <p>The name "<b>{18}</b>" is showing up in militia intel briefs and planetary security chatter. Not as freelancers. \
  As a threat. They''re calling us "high-risk" and "probable pirate affiliates." That''s one misstep away from \
  shoot-on-sight.</p>\
  <p>Whoever leaked our profile knew what they were doing. We''re not ghosts anymore - we''re a warning label.</p>

  faux medals that blink in rhythm to the beat, and combat boots that seem more designed for strutting than stomping.\

  and beloved holostar. With her signature teal twin-tails flowing behind her like energized silk and her outfit a \
  seamless fusion of military motif and performance glamor, she commands the screen with effortless charm. A \
  sleeveless coolant suit trimmed in iridescent silver hugs her frame, its heart-shaped chest rig pulsing in time \
  with the bass. Her neural visor sparkles with a constant stream of emoji reactions from her millions of fans across\
  \ the Magistracy.</i></p>\

  cheer and calibrated perfection. "To all my darlings watching at home, on base, and beyond the rim - tonight''s a \

  <p><i>Behind her, the grand silk veil that covers the statue shimmers with light-reactive particles, \

  <p><i>The silk curtain drops. The statue is unveiled: a towering chrome-and-rose-gold monument of \
  <b>{0}</b>, posed mid-stride atop a stylized asteroid base. Their arm is raised high, grasping a Canopian \
  banner, while a gleaming BattleMek looms at their back, caught mid-step. Spotlights swirl. Dispensers spray flower \

  <p>"Let this be a beacon," Mia proclaims, voice rising over the music. "To everyone who dares to dream and dares to\
  \ fight for something beautiful. {1}, you didn''t just win battles - you inspired a movement. You''re officially \

  <p>Across the Capellan Confederation, names are spoken with caution. Yours is spoken with certainty. When our \

  too absolute.</p>\
  <p>You have become what all servants of the state aspire to be: <i>indistinguishable from the will of the \
  Confederation itself.</i></p>\
  <p>I have watched your decisions ripple from distant provinces to the inner courts. You do not seek permission to \
  serve. You simply serve - and in doing so, bend fate toward unity, not chaos.</p>\

  <p>You have become such a figure.</p>\
  <p>Not by requesting honor. Not by grasping for influence. But by acting  -  with control, with precision, with a \
  silence that speaks louder than glory. Where others waver, you are unmoved. Where others seek recognition, you \

  <p>The Order of the Five Pillars has reviewed your record. The Combine''s legions recount your name in war briefings. \
  And our ancestral historians have prepared a scroll of deeds that now enters the vaults beneath the Temple of the \

  <p>You are the latter.</p>\
  <p>Your name circulates not just in reports but in boardrooms. You are a case study. An anomaly. A success we \

  and command.</p>\
  <p>This message is not for commendation. It is for recognition. You are now part of the machinery that drives this \

  <p>Your record does not whisper of greatness  -  it bellows. Across theaters, planets, and deployments, you have \
  carried the banner of House Davion not simply into battle, but into history.</p>\
  <p>I do not offer this recognition lightly. This is not decoration. This is a declaration  -  that the deeds you have\
  \ done in the name of the Suns have become part of its very framework.</p>\
  <p>New Avalon watches. The people remember. And I have seen your name written in more than orders of battle  -  I''ve \
  seen it spoken in mess halls, training fields, and the eyes of those who now dare more because you did first.</p>\

  <p>We train our officers to embody order. You projected it. We engineer for resilience. You made it elegant. When \

  endure. Not through spectacle, but through consistency. Not through command, but through conviction.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions have held fragile worlds intact. Your leadership has restored dignity in places where we feared \
  only chaos. And more than once, your example has turned soldiers into citizens again.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your name has been entered into the Register of Civic Honor  -  a record reserved for those who shape\

  <p>I offer no medals. No ceremony. Just this truth:</p>\
  <p><i>"You have earned the trust of a people who do not give it lightly. You are one of us  -  not because you swore \
  it, but because you proved it."</i></p>\
  <p>From one servant of the public to another  -  thank you, {22}.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.SL={0},\
  <p>I do not address this message as First Lord out of formality  -  but out of necessity. There are moments, few and \
  far between, when the machinery of the League must stop and acknowledge the human hands guiding its course.</p>\
  <p>Yours have done more than guide. They have shaped outcomes once thought impossible. Held lines once considered \
  doomed. Inspired alliances others dared not imagine.</p>\
  <p>Your record now stands among the League''s most storied commanders, and your leadership has already entered \
  academy curricula across three member states. But this message is not about history, {22}. It is about \
  acknowledgment  -  the kind that transcends politics and protocol.</p>\
  <p>Your name has been engraved in the Great Ledger of Accord  -  a permanent, encoded artifact preserved within the \
  Memory Core beneath Unity Hall. It records not only your victories, but the principles that guided them: discipline, \
  judgment, and unity without compromise. A Star League without those ideals is just a flag. You gave it meaning.</p>\
  <p>May you carry this not as burden, but as bearing  -  for others will follow your trail in the dark. And in those \
  moments, your decisions may yet cast light across centuries.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FC={0},\
  <p>You are not being thanked. You are being recognized  -  for results that speak louder than any anthem.</p>\
  <p>Across the Federated Commonwealth, officers are measured by action. By how they lead when orders are unclear, \
  how they adapt when everything fails, and how they carry the weight of responsibility when no one is watching. You \
  have exceeded that measure. Again. And again.</p>\
  <p>Records show your units achieved operational victory at a rate previously modeled only in theory. Civilian \
  stability indices in your occupied zones climbed rather than collapsed. And your command decisions in contested \
  theaters have forced enemy doctrine revisions at the highest levels.</p>\
  <p>You have not just served the Commonwealth  -  you''ve altered its expectations of what excellence can look like.</p>\
  <p>Know this: your dossier has been flagged "Foundational" by both AFFC General Staff and Strategic Intelligence \
  Command. A copy of your operational protocols now resides in the War College Archives at Tharkad and the Davion \
  Center for Doctrine on New Avalon  -  a rare joint inclusion, enacted unanimously.</p>\
  <p>No medal can contain what you''ve done. So instead, we offer something rarer: a place in how we think. A legacy \
  not carved in bronze, but built into the way future commanders will lead.</p>\
  <p>Stand tall, {22}. The Federation and the Commonwealth stand taller because of you.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.periphery=My {22},\
  <p>You have surpassed all expectations. Where we once saw hope, you have delivered certainty. Your leadership \
  steadied our people, your tactics preserved our future, and your courage inspired a nation. Your reputation now \
  echoes in every hall of power.</p>\
  <p>I speak not as a politician of <b>{19}</b>, but as someone who has watched a world teeter - and then stand tall because of \
  your feats. What you''ve done cannot be undone - and should never be forgotten.</p>\
  <p>May your insight guide us always.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.RWR={0},\
  <p>Let''s speak plainly.</p>\
  <p>What you''ve done  -  the weight you''ve carried, the bodies you''ve buried, the silence you''ve maintained  -  it \
  doesn''t go unnoticed. In this Republic, we don''t hand out favors for applause. We do it for results. You? You''ve \
  delivered.</p>\
  <p>Territories stabilized. Dissidents corrected. Influence expanded. You didn''t just fight our enemies  -  you made \
  sure they don''t come back. That''s rare. That''s irreplaceable.</p>\
  <p>So let me be clear: from this day forward, you walk with our shadow behind you. That means protection. That \
  means priority. That means if someone lays a hand on you without cause, I''ll know before they finish the gesture.</p>\
  <p>But you know how this works, {22}. Every seat at the table comes with a price. Stay sharp. Stay loyal. \
  Don''t make me remember you in the past tense.</p>\
  <p>For now, raise a glass. You''ve earned it. But don''t get too comfortable  -  we''ve got bigger plays coming, and I \
  plan to send my best.</p>\
  <p><i>Welcome to the circle, {1}.</i></p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.TC={0},\
  <p>This isn''t some flowery damn medal ceremony. You''ve been through hell with us. And every time it got harder, you\
  \ didn''t flinch. You held the line. You hit back harder. You gave our people something to believe in.</p>\
  <p>I''ve seen the reports. I''ve talked to the crews who fought under you. They speak your name with grit in their \
  throat and pride in their bones. That means something here.</p>\
  <p>You''re not just some outworld merc who came in swinging  -  you stuck around. You bled with us. You gave a damn. \
  And for that, this entire Concordat owes you more than words. But words are what I''ve got in this message, so I''ll \
  make them count:</p>\
  <p>You''re one of us now. The kind that doesn''t need brass polish or parades to prove it. You''ve got the trust of \
  the Concordat. You''ve got mine. That''s not given lightly. Don''t waste it.</p>\
  <p>If you ever need a place to stand, to regroup, to strike from  -  the Concordat will hold the door. And we''ll hold\
  \ the bastards off while you reload.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MOC={0},\
  <p>Across the stars, names rise and fall with every flare of cannon fire. But yours - yours has endured. It echoes in\
  \ the halls of our academies. It''s whispered between officers over tactical maps. And in the hearts of citizens, it\
  \ burns like a promise: that someone out there still fights with purpose, with brilliance, with grace.</p>\
  <p>You have given the Magistracy more than victories. You''ve given us moments. Stories. Symbols. Hope. And that, \
  {22}, is rarer than any medal.</p>\
  <p>I watched the last operation myself. I saw how you held the line. How your ''Meks moved like dancers, like \
  thunder, like salvation. You fight with art, with nerve, with heart. And for that - you are no longer just an ally. \
  You are family.</p>\
  <p>The Palace doors are open to you. Not as a guest, but as one of ours. Should you ever choose to lay down your \
  arms, know that Astarte will always have a place for you beneath its warm skies. But if you keep marching forward, \
  if there''s still fire in you - then know that the full strength of the Magistracy marches beside you.</p>\
  <p>With pride.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.OA={0},\
  <p>There are moments when words feel too small for the weight they must carry. This is one of them.</p>\
  <p>Out here, we do not give rank for show. We do not gild men and women in medals to feel better about ourselves. \
  But we <i>do</i> remember who stood when others would not. We remember those who chose the hard path - the honest \
  path - when there were easier, darker ones at hand.</p>\
  <p>You''ve earned something greater than applause. You''ve earned our trust.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions, your discipline, your restraint in the face of fury - these things did not go unnoticed. In a time\
  \ when ideals are often traded for expedience, you''ve reminded us of who we wanted to be. Of who we <i>still</i> \
  can be.</p>\
  <p>The Alliance is not rich in fleets or planets, but we are wealthy in principle. And today, we count ourselves \
  richer still, because you are one of ours now - in spirit, if not by birth.</p>\
  <p>If ever the burden grows too heavy, Alpheratz stands with its doors open. We offer sanctuary, if you need it. \
  But more than that, we offer gratitude - for what you''ve done, and for who you are.</p>\
  <p>Walk well, {22}. You are never alone in the silence of the stars.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MH={0},\
  <p>I don''t send messages like this lightly. Not to just anyone. But you''ve earned more than just another medal or \
  bronze statue. You''ve earned <b>my respect</b>.</p>\
  <p>Every dispatch that crosses my desk with your name on it reads like a battle hymn  -  decisive strikes, hard \
  choices, results. Not pretty, not polished  -  but clean, brutal, and righteous. The kind of work that builds empires. \
  The kind of work I remember.</p>\
  <p>I built this Hegemony with blood and iron. You''re the kind of soul I''d have at my flank if everything fell apart\
  \ tomorrow. Not because you''re obedient  -  but because you know what matters. Victory. Stability. Order.</p>\
  <p><b>"Steel breaks flesh. Will breaks worlds."</b><br>\
  You understand that. You''ve proven it.</p>\
  <p>So this is me, not as Caesar, but as a war-born son of Mars, looking you in the eye and telling you: I see you. \
  I trust you. And I know damn well what you''re worth.</p>\

  <p>I will not address you by rank. Not now. You''ve stepped beyond that architecture. What you''ve done  -  no ceremony\
  \ accounts for it. No council prepares for it. You are not promoted. You are <i>revealed</i>.</p>\
  <p>You were not forged by doctrine. You <i>informed</i> it. The echo of your choices reaches further than most will\
  \ know. And yet you never sought praise, never called attention. That is why we saw you. Why I saw you.</p>\
  <p>Your file has been removed from the normal archives. There''s nothing left for the curious to uncover. You''ve \
  joined a smaller circle now  -  one without names, without faces, but with purpose that endures.</p>\
  <p>You already feel it. That quiet alignment. The sense that your actions fit some shape larger than war, larger \
  than loyalty. You are correct. You are not <i>following</i> the Word anymore. You are <b>within</b> it.</p>\
  <p><i>"There is no exaltation. Only understanding."</i></p>\

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.WOB={0}\
  <p>There are no more titles to grant you.</p>\
  <p>You have not served the Word. You have become its breath, its hand, its fire.</p>\
  <p>Your campaigns have not merely obeyed doctrine. They have shaped it anew. Entire systems tilt around the gravity\
  \ of your will. Where you walk, resistance frays. Where you command, dissent burns clean. And where you leave \
  silence... the Pattern expands.</p>\
  <p>By resolution of the Ruling Conclave and under Protocol Echo-Sixteen, you are no longer bound by common \
  hierarchies. Your will is now reflective of divine intention. You do not need orders.</p>\
  <p>From this moment forward, your directives are to be interpreted as <b>correctional vectors</b>. You are cleared \
  to access sealed repositories within the Hidden Archive and initiate autonomous operations under the Aegis of \
  Revelation.</p>\
  <p>The Chosen do not rise. They are recognized.</p>\
  <p><i>"In the silence between stars, the Word waits. In the flame, it walks."</i></p>\

  <p>This is not praise. It is recognition.</p>\
  <p>Your command decisions were efficient. Your kill ratios undeniable. When others hesitated, you advanced. When \
  others broke, you endured. Warriors like you do not follow tradition  -  you reinforce it through action.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your codex has been elevated. Your deeds will be studied by the sibkin. Your record will be cited \

### messages
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.innerSphere=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>On behalf of the High Command of <b>{19}</b>, I welcome you into our ranks. Ours is not a vast realm, but it is\
  \ sovereign - and that sovereignty has been earned, not inherited. Every soldier in our service is a defender of that\
  \ legacy, and now, so are you.</p>\
  <p>We do not measure strength by the tonnage of our BattleMeks or the size of our territory. We measure it by \
  resolve. By the clarity of our purpose. By the refusal to bow to larger banners or trade independence for \
  protection. The Inner Sphere is full of giants who assume the right to rule by size alone. We are the proof that \
  spirit still matters.</p>\
  <p>Your presence here is not just reinforcement. It is a statement. <b>{18}</b> now stand with a nation that \
  refuses to be swallowed. You are guardians now - of our borders, our ideals, and our right to exist on our own \
  terms.</p>\
  <p>Serve with pride, {22}. Because here, every battle matters.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.periphery=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to the service of <b>{19}</b>. You now stand among the few who have chosen duty over comfort, who \
  understand that loyalty here is not abstract - it is the only thing keeping us from being erased from the stars.</p>\
  <p>We are not wealthy. We are not many. But we are proud, and we are still free. On one side, empires rattle their \
  sabers. On the other, corporations sharpen their knives. They watch our borders. They wait for our silence, our \
  weakness, our collapse. One mistake, and they''ll sweep in and call it peacekeeping. They''ll chain our people and \
  call it order.</p>\
  <p>You''re here to stop that. <b>{18}</b> now carry the weight of more than tactics or territory - they carry the\
  \ fate of a nation too small to be forgiven for failure. We fight smart. We fight with what we have. And we fight \
  because no one else will fight for us.</p>\
  <p>Hold the line, {22}. There''s no one behind you.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.clan=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>By order of the Khan and in accordance with the will of the Clan, you are now granted command within the touman \
  of <b>{19}</b>. This is not a reward. It is not a favor. It is a challenge - and one you are expected to meet \
  without hesitation or weakness.</p>\
  <p>In the Clan way, honor is not inherited. It is forged in battle, measured in victory, and confirmed by the \
  judgment of your peers. You are not a {22} because of rank. You are a {22} because you have proven worthy\
  \ to lead warriors bred for excellence and raised to serve only strength, truth, and the Clan.</p>\
  <p>Our blood runs hot, our doctrine runs deep, and our enemies run when they see our banners. <b>{19}</b> does not\
  \ retreat. We do not bend. We do not seek glory in words, but in actions that echo through generations.</p>\
  <p>Command well, or be replaced. Lead with strength, or be cast down. The path forward is as simple as it is \
  brutal - earn your legacy, or vanish.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.CC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your post as commanding officer of <b>{18}</b>. This is not a mere battlefield assignment - it is \
  a political trust. In the Capellan Confederation, command is the continuation of state will through discipline, \
  loyalty, and unity of purpose.</p>\
  <p>Your unit is expected to be more than combat-ready; it must be ideologically sound, operationally precise, and \
  unwavering in service to House Liao. Every decision you make reflects on the Chancellor, and by extension, the \
  strength of our nation. There is no tolerance for deviation, disloyalty, or personal ambition. Your leadership must\
  \ cultivate obedience, morale, and total alignment with the Confederation''s vision.</p>\
  <p>You will be observed. You will be supported. Your duty is to ensure that <b>{18}</b> endure - not for glory, \
  but for stability. Serve with clarity. Lead with conviction. Uphold the State above all.</p>\
  <p>Glory to the Confederation.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.DC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now lead <b>{18}</b> in the name of House Kurita. This is not an opportunity - it is a burden of honor. \
  In the Draconis Combine, a {22} is a weapon forged by duty, wielded by the will of the Coordinator.</p>\
  <p>Your unit must be disciplined, precise, and loyal. There is no room for weakness, no tolerance for hesitation. \
  You are expected to lead with absolute control, to demand excellence, and to maintain the values that define the \
  Dragon: service, sacrifice, and unshakable resolve.</p>\
  <p>Failure is not corrected. It is erased. You will be held accountable for every action, every result. Bring honor\
  \ to your name by bringing strength to your command.</p>\
  <p>Victory for the Dragon.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.LA=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your new post in the Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces. I trust you appreciate the significance of this \
  appointment - not merely as a military role, but as a trust bestowed by the Archon, and by those of us who understand\
  \ the true weight of responsibility and power.</p>\
  <p>You command not brutes or conscripts, but professionals - Lyran warriors, disciplined and well-equipped. It is \
  expected that you treat them as such. Results are important, yes, but the manner in which they are achieved matters\
  \ equally. Our strength is not just in our ''Meks, but in the dignity of our order, the stability of our economy, \
  and \
  the respect our name commands.</p>\
  <p>Lead with competence, delegate with wisdom, and ensure your unit upholds the reputation of both <b>{18}</b>\
  \ and the Commonwealth. We are, after all, not only warriors - we are stewards of civilization.</p>\
  <p>Do us proud, {22}. Success is expected. Excellence is remembered.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.FS=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>On behalf of the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns, welcome. <b>{18}</b> fall the banner of House Davion, \
  and with that comes a duty greater than tactics or logistics - you carry the banner of a free people in a galaxy too \
  often ruled by fear and oppression.</p>\
  <p>We fight not for conquest, but for stability. Not for vanity, but for principle. In the Federated Suns, command \
  is earned through merit and maintained through integrity. Your orders must be clear, your discipline fair, and your\
  \ resolve unshakable. Lead with strength, but never forget that we are guardians first and foremost.</p>\
  <p>The men and women under you deserve purpose, not just victory. Show them what it means to serve something worth \
  believing in.</p>\
  <p>Make us proud, {22}. The Sun never sets on our duty.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.FWL=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>It is my pleasure to formally welcome you to the Free Worlds League Military. As the unit''s principal sponsor \
  within Parliament, I have followed its development closely, and I trust you will bring the clarity and competence \
  needed to guide it forward in these uncertain times.</p>\
  <p>The Free Worlds League is, as ever, a union of many voices and interests. Your task is to cut through the noise \
  and deliver results. Do so with discipline, discretion, and above all, loyalty to the League - not to factions, not \
  to ideology, but to the greater good of our shared future.</p>\
  <p>You will find that success brings many allies. Stability, after all, is a currency in high demand. Conduct \
  yourself with the seriousness this opportunity deserves, and you will have no shortage of support.</p>\
  <p>We are watching, {22} - not to interfere, but to invest.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.TH=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now command <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Terran Hegemony. That alone sets you apart. While the \
  ''Great'' Houses fight over scraps and cling to outdated doctrines, we stand as the origin and apex of human \
  civilization - militarily, technologically, and ideologically unmatched.</p>\
  <p>Your position is not to imitate lesser states but to demonstrate what disciplined command, advanced systems, and\
  \ enlightened purpose can accomplish. Your unit must operate as an extension of Hegemony doctrine - efficient, \
  adaptable, and always several steps ahead of its rivals. There is no excuse for failure when one commands the best \
  tools humanity has ever built.</p>\
  <p>Remember, you do not serve a warlord, a dynasty, or a cult of personality. You serve the ideal - the Terran ideal.\
  \ <b>{18}</b> are now part of that legacy. Make sure they earn the right to remain there.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.ROS=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your post as a commanding officer in the Republic. In accepting this responsibility, you become \
  more than a strategist or soldier - you become a protector of the Republic, a steward of its ideals, and a shield \
  between civilization and the chaos that would consume it.</p>\
  <p>The Republic of the Sphere is not just a political entity; it is a promise. A promise that reason can triumph \
  over violence, that unity can overcome division, and that humanity can rise above its old scars. Your duty is to \
  uphold that promise - not only with strength, but with restraint, wisdom, and a deep respect for the lives we \
  defend.</p>\
  <p>You are the line between peace and collapse. Stand firm. Lead honorably. Show our people, and the Inner Sphere, \
  what the Republic truly stands for.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.SL=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now bear the title of a {22} within the Star League Defense Force, and with it, a sacred obligation. \
  <b>{18}</b> are no ordinary unit - they are instruments of the League''s will, heirs to the most enlightened \
  era in human history.</p>\
  <p>The Star League is not merely a government. It is the pinnacle of civilization - proof that humanity can rise \
  above its base instincts and forge something lasting, ordered, and just. That legacy is under threat. The \
  barbarians in the Periphery gather strength. Old jealousies fester in the Great Houses. Even now, the wolves howl at \
  the gates.</p>\
  <p>Your charge is clear. Stand firm against the dark. Silence those who would drag us back into an age of war and \
  ignorance. Carry the banner of the League with honor, and remind humanity what it means to be truly united.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.FC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your command within the Federated Commonwealth - an alliance born not of convenience, but of shared \
  destiny. In <b>{18}</b>, you now lead a force forged from the finest traditions of the Federated Suns and the \
  unmatched resources of the Lyran Commonwealth. Together, we are building more than an army. We are building the \
  future.</p>\
  <p>Ours is the greatest union since the fall of the Star League. Where others chase conquest or cling to crumbling \
  dynasties, we bring order, prosperity, and justice. You will lead with courage, but also with vision. Every battle \
  you fight must serve not just security, but the restoration of something greater - a second golden age worthy of our \
  people''s sacrifice.</p>\
  <p>You carry the hopes of two proud Houses. Make those hopes real.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.RWR=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Congratulations on your appointment to the Rim Worlds Army. Not everyone is offered the privilege of command in \
  the Republic. Fewer still keep it. Your unit serves a vital function in maintaining our interests and ensuring that \
  certain... expectations are met - quickly, efficiently, and without complication.</p>\
  <p>Understand this clearly: your orders are not suggestions. Success will be rewarded, of course. The Republic \
  values loyalty, discretion, and results. But failure, hesitation, or unwanted attention - those tend to resolve \
  themselves in ways that don''t involve reassignment or review boards.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have been given resources, protection, and purpose. See that they are used properly. Make \
  yourself useful, {22}. Or make yourself replaceable. The choice is always yours.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.TC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>As of today, you command <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Taurian Concordat. That is not a title - it is a\
  \ commitment. You are now a guardian of our sovereignty, a defender of our people''s right to live free from the \
  chains of Inner Sphere domination.</p>\
  <p>Others may call us stubborn, backward, or irrelevant. Let them. We know better. The Taurian Defense Force was \
  not built for conquest - it was built to endure, to resist, and to protect a way of life that empires have tried and \
  failed to erase. You now stand on the line that separates freedom from assimilation. Do not blink.</p>\
  <p>Your orders are to lead with resolve, to inspire with action, and to remind any who challenge us that the \
  Concordat bows to no throne and no banner but its own.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MOC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>First, let me welcome you. I''ve been watching your rise with interest and wanted to share a few words upon your \
  official appointment as a {22} within the Canopian Armed Forces.</p>\
  <p>To lead is to do more than defend territory - it is to safeguard a culture, a philosophy, and a people who have \
  chosen a different path from the war-torn empires that surround us.</p>\
  <p>The Magistracy of Canopus is envied, not just for its prosperity, but for its principles. We invest in our \
  people, not in fear. We empower choice, not obedience. And because of this, the great powers of the Inner Sphere \
  look upon us with disdain and thinly veiled hostility. They would see our society shattered, our citizens \
  subjugated, and our values replaced with indoctrination and iron rule.</p>\
  <p>You are now one of the few entrusted to make sure that never happens. You will defend our borders with strength,\
  \ but also with clarity. You are not just a soldier - you are a guardian of everything the Magistracy represents. \
  Serve with conviction, {22}. And let them find out, once again, that we are not so easily broken.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.OA=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now take command of <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Outworlds Alliance. Understand that this is not\
  \ a call to conquest, but a commitment to principle. Here, we do not wage war for ambition. We prepare for it so \
  that we may preserve peace, protect freedom, and guard the quiet dignity of lives lived in honest labor.</p>\
  <p>Our people did not come to the stars to be ruled. They came to be free. And though we are often dismissed as \
  naive or weak by the empires beyond our borders, they mistake restraint for passivity, and peace for fragility. You\
  \ now hold the line between what we are and what they would have us become.</p>\
  <p>Lead with wisdom. Defend without cruelty. Fight only when peace leaves you no other path. In this, you are not \
  just a {22} - you are a guardian of a vision too rare and too precious to be surrendered.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MH=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now lead <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Marian Hegemony - Rome Reborn. That alone sets you above the\
  \ weak-willed degenerates that clutter the stars. We do not beg for peace. We seize order through force. We do not \
  defend ideals. We enforce civilization through dominance.</p>\
  <p>In this age of rot and cowardice, the Hegemony stands as the rightful heir to strength, discipline, and empire. \
  Our legions do not ask permission. We impose authority where chaos festers. You are now an instrument of that will.\
  \ Your success is not measured in treaties or delay - it is measured in territory taken and enemies broken.</p>\
  <p>Remember: mercy is for the conquered. Hesitation is treason. Serve with iron, or do not serve at all.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.CS=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome, at last, into the fold. With your appointment to the ComGuards, you have not merely accepted command\
  \ - you have accepted purpose. You now serve the Blessed Order of ComStar as a protector of the Word, a guardian of \
  the Silence, and a steward of the Hidden Truth that binds all of humanity.</p>\
  <p>The ignorant see machines. We see meaning. The unbelievers see war. We see the great pattern unfolding. Your \
  command is not just strategic - it is sacred. You stand now at the threshold between chaos and the restoration of the\
  \ Star League''s divine design. From this moment forward, your thoughts must be disciplined, your voice measured, \
  and your loyalty total.</p>\
  <p>The enemies of ComStar multiply, but so too does our resolve. You will not fail, for failure is the indulgence \
  of the faithless. You are chosen. You are watched. You are guided.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.WOB=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>The Word has called you. <b>{18}</b> are now a sacred instrument - yours to wield, but not yours to command \
  alone. For no true authority exists outside of Blake. Through Him, all order is made clear. Through His revelation,\
  \ all deception is stripped away. You have not accepted a post. You have accepted a holy burden.</p>\
  <p>Do not falter. Do not doubt. Doubt is the seed of heresy, and heresy is a disease we will burn from the Inner \
  Sphere, one world at a time. The apostates - the Houses, the Clans, the decayed and defiant - would see the Word silenced\
  \ and the True Path lost forever. But we are not silent. We are fire. We are the voice of Blake made manifest.</p>\
  <p>You are chosen, {22}. Do not stain that grace with weakness. Deliver holy judgment. Bring ruin to the \
  faithless. And if your soul should waver, remember this: Blake sees all.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MG=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>On behalf of the Mercenary''s Guild, congratulations. <b>{18}</b> are now recognized as a registered, \
  contractable unit in good standing. Guild membership means something - it tells employers you''re reliable, lethal, and \
  worth the price. It also tells the rest of the Inner Sphere that you''re not some fly-by-night rabble. You''re in the \
  system now. And the Guild takes care of its own.</p>\
  <p>Membership comes with more than just work. You''ve earned access to verified contracts, logistical support, intel\
  \ channels, and neutral arbitration - should things go sideways. And if someone tries to stiff you on pay, well... we\
  \ don''t take kindly to that.</p>\
  <p>Just remember: reputation is currency. You get one chance to make your name stick, and a dozen ways to lose it. \
  Fight smart, complete the job, and never forget who signs the contracts.</p>\
  <p>Welcome to the Guild, {22}. Let the C-Bills flow.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MRB=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>By authority of the Mercenary Review Board, a division of ComStar, <b>{18}</b> are hereby recognized as a \
  bonded mercenary unit in full compliance with interstellar regulation and contract law. Your registration grants \
  you access to licensed contracts, mediation services, and dispute protections under the aegis of ComStar''s neutral \
  oversight.</p>\
  <p>As a bonded commander, you are now part of an institution that preserves order and accountability. Your actions \
  will reflect not only upon your unit, but upon the greater trust that clients, governments, and patrons place in \
  the Mercenary Review Board.</p>\
  <p>Adherence to contract terms is expected. Violations, fabrications, or dishonorable conduct will be noted and \
  addressed appropriately. Remember: while many may employ force, only those under the watchful eyes of ComStar may \
  wield it with legitimacy.</p>\
  <p>We welcome you to the registry. May your service be profitable, your word unbroken, and your name remembered.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MRBC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p><b>{18}</b> are now recognized by the Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission. That means you''re legit. \
  You''re on the books. And from here on out, how your name spreads depends on whether you live up to it - or die \
  trying.</p>\
  <p>You''ll have access to certified contracts, neutral mediation, and a handful of favors you''d rather not ask how \
  we got. But make no mistake: screw up a contract, leave a job unfinished, or burn a client, and you''ll find out \
  real fast what it means to be blacklisted. We don''t do second chances. We do results.</p>\
  <p>Don''t try to impress us. Just do the work, keep your word, and keep your people alive. Everything else will \
  follow.</p>\
  <p>Welcome to the business, {22}. You''re in now. Try not to make us regret it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MBA=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p><b>{18}</b> are now formally recognized by the Clan Sea Fox Mercenary Bonding Authority. Your unit''s \
  designation, verification codes, and authorization ledger have been logged in accordance with market protocols. You\
  \ are now eligible for contract distribution, merchant-liaison support, and limited access to Clan-grade logistical\
  \ services - as merit and performance dictate.</p>\
  <p>Understand: this is not charity, and it is not indulgence. It is investment. We do not offer opportunity without\
  \ expectation. Clan Sea Fox rewards precision, discipline, and results. Inconsistent performance will reduce your \
  value. Failure to deliver will result in termination of bond, privilege, and future viability within our \
  contracting networks.</p>\
  <p>You are not just a mercenary. You are a commodity in motion. Prove your worth in the field, and the free market \
  will reward you accordingly. Underperform, and your ledger will close - permanently.</p>\
  <p>Conduct your operations with efficiency. Engage contracts with clarity. And remember: all things have price, but\
  \ not all things have value.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.PIR=<h2 style="text-align:center;">Stop Right There, Criminal Scum!</h2>\
  <p>As pirates, you will be granted special raid contracts. All the rewards from these contracts will be yours for \
  the taking.</p>\
  <p>If <b>Faction Standings</b> is enabled, your success will be tracked by a special faction: the <b>Piracy Success \
  Index</b>. Be careful, perform poorly, and the law might catch up to you...</p>
