  <p>All rank and associated command authority are revoked upon delivery of this notice. You are entitled to standard\
  \ retirement benefits in accordance with <b>{19}</b> military code.</p>\
  <p>Service in the <b>{19}</b> Armed Forces is a privilege earned through performance. When that performance fails,\

  <p>Effective immediately, you are to accept mandatory retirement, thereby removing your name from the active chain \

  <p>You will retain eligibility for veteran benefits and will be provided with a modest residence and stipend \

  <p>The Capellan Confederation recognizes long-standing service, and we remain grateful to all who have committed \
  themselves to the defense of the State. It is in this spirit that we extend to you a transition opportunity that \
  will allow your experience to serve the Confederation in a more stable and structured capacity.</p>\
  <p>Following repeated reviews of your recent field deployments, the Ministry of Defense has determined that your \
  present command posture no longer aligns with current strategic expectations. This assessment reflects not ill \
  intent, but a necessary recalibration in the interest of broader national security.</p>\
  <p>You are therefore directed to accept reassignment to Strategic Reserve Status, effective immediately. This role \
  carries no field responsibilities but preserves your record, benefits, and standing. It is the considered position \
  of this office that acceptance of this transition will demonstrate continued loyalty and ideological clarity - both \
  of which are monitored with great interest in today''s environment.</p>\
  <p>There is no dishonor in stepping aside when the State requires it. There is, however, concern when such requests\

  <p>The Dragon expects absolute devotion, but it also demands that honor be maintained, even in failure. Your recent\

  greater scrutiny, not only upon you, but upon the legacy of your family.</p>\
  <p>The Coordinator''s wisdom grants you a final opportunity: to step aside with dignity, to enter retirement \
  quietly, and to protect what can still be preserved. This transition is not a punishment. It is a gesture of \
  restraint - for your name, and for your ancestors who once served more ably than you have.</p>\
  <p>You are hereby directed to accept immediate retirement from active duty. Your service record will remain sealed \
  to the public. No formal dishonor will be attached to your name, provided you comply without hesitation.</p>\
  <p>The Dragon sees all. It remembers not only your deeds but your choices. Leave now, and let your name speak of \

  <p>After a thorough performance review and in consultation with the Regional Command Board, it has been determined \
  that your continued presence in the active command structure is no longer conducive to the operational goals of the\
  \ Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces.</p>\
  <p>While we appreciate the unique circumstances under which your commission was originally acquired, such \
  appointments must still meet the demands of the field. Recent outcomes have made it clear that such demands have, \
  regrettably, not been met.</p>\
  <p>To preserve institutional integrity - and to ensure that personnel placement is aligned with meritocratic \
  expectations - you are advised to accept voluntary retirement, effective immediately. This course of action will \
  allow you to retain pension rights, social standing and will prevent the need for more formal inquiry into \
  <b>{18}</b>'' performance metrics.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.FS={0},\
  <p>Service in the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns is a calling - an act of faith in the ideals of freedom, \
  justice, and duty. Those who accept that burden are expected to rise to the standard set by generations of officers\
  \ before them. Unfortunately, recent assessments of your field performance indicate that standard has not been \
  met.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have faced a string of setbacks and failures that cannot be ignored. We recognize the \
  complexities of command, but the outcome remains the same: operational underperformance that places mission \
  integrity and the reputation of our forces at risk.</p>\
  <p>To that end, and in the interest of preserving both your dignity and the public''s confidence in the Armed \
  Forces, you are hereby encouraged to accept honorable retirement, effective immediately. This path ensures your \
  record closes with decorum and prevents further embarrassment to the service you once swore to uphold.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Suns remains grateful for those who try. But we must be led by those who succeed.</p>

  <p>In light of recent evaluations conducted by the Joint Provincial Oversight Board and at the recommendation of \
  multiple member-state defense representatives, the Ministry has determined that your current role within the Free \
  Worlds League Military is best concluded through a strategic transition to retirement status.</p>\
  <p>This recommendation is not solely a reflection of battlefield performance - though that record, as reviewed, \
  raises valid questions - but rather a product of evolving priorities within the interprovincial command structure. \
  As you are well aware, cohesion and political alignment are as vital to stability as tactical efficiency.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are requested to accept retirement with honors, effective immediately. This transition \
  ensures continued access to your benefits and precludes the need for further review by any standing committees or \
  oversight panels. It is, we believe, the most prudent course for all parties involved.</p>

  <p>The Terran Hegemony maintains the highest standards of operational integrity, not only for the sake of military \
  effectiveness, but because each officer bears the symbolic weight of our civilization''s legacy. As such, continued \

  <p>Following an internal audit and review of recent field deployments under your command, the Strategic Conduct \
  Board has concluded that your continued visibility within the active forces presents an unnecessary reputational \
  risk to the Hegemony''s unified image.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are directed to accept immediate retirement from all active duties. This transition will \
  preserve your benefits, minimize external scrutiny, and ensure your name is recorded with due dignity. We expect \
  you to understand the value of this path and the discretion it affords.</p>\
  <p>The Hegemony does not fail. It adjusts. Quietly, and without spectacle.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.COMMANDER_RETIREMENT.ROS={0},\
  <p>The Republic was founded upon the belief that strength does not come from domination, but from unity. Every \

  <p>After a comprehensive review of your recent command history, the Unified Command Council has determined that \
  your continued service in an active operational role no longer aligns with the expectations and needs of the \
  Republic Armed Forces. This decision is not taken lightly. It reflects neither condemnation nor dishonor, but \
  rather a call to protect the harmony we have all sworn to uphold.</p>\
  <p>You are therefore directed to accept honorable retirement, effective immediately. This transition will be \
  conducted with the utmost respect for your prior service, and with full recognition of your contributions. It is \
  the firm recommendation of this office that you embrace this course - not only for your own legacy, but for the \
  continued cohesion of the Republic''s military structure.</p>

  <p>Following a formal evaluation by the Personnel Review Directorate, it has been determined that your recent \
  performance in the field does not meet the standards required of SLDF command personnel. The cumulative impact of \
  these operational shortcomings compels us to take corrective action in service to institutional integrity.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, you are directed to enter mandatory retirement. This action preserves the dignity of your\
  \ service and removes the need for formal disciplinary proceedings. You will retain all honors accrued and are \

  <p>Following an operational review of your command record, the General Staff has concluded that your recent \
  performance does not align with the expectations of active-duty leadership. While your service is noted, the \
  present trajectory of your command leaves no viable path for continued assignment at this level.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, you are to accept immediate retirement from active duty. Your transition will be conducted with \
  full honors and administrative support. This course of action is final, and no alternate posting will be \
  considered.</p>\

  <p>Following an internal consensus review, it has been determined that your continued presence in uniform no longer\

  <p>This transition will include a generous relocation package, housing allowance, and severance bonus. Declining \

  <p>After careful review of your recent operational record, it is the decision of this command that your continued \
  presence in an active role compromises the effectiveness and cohesion of our forces. In light of this, you are \

  <p>This decision preserves your record from further scrutiny and allows the Concordat to redirect its resources \

  Personnel Affairs Board has determined that the most appropriate course of action is for you to accept retirement \
  with full honors and benefits, effective immediately.</p>\
  <p>This is not a punitive decision, but a preventative one - designed to preserve your personal well-being, protect\
  \ the stability of the forces under your former command, and allow you the space to reinvest in your future beyond\
  active service.</p>\
  <p>You will retain access to medical care, housing stipends, and vocational transition programs through the \

  <p>As such, by the judgment of the Inner Sanctum, you are hereby invited to permanent doctrinal reassignment at a \

  <p>After a full review of your command''s operational performance, logistical conduct, and adherence to League \

  <p>It is with measured concern that we bring to your attention a pattern of field outcomes under your stewardship \
  that diverge from the order and clarity expected of those entrusted with ComStar''s banner.</p>\
  <p>Such outcomes do not yet warrant censure, but they must not continue. You are therefore advised to treat this \
  communication as a formal warning, and an opportunity for self-correction under the guidance of the Blessed Word.</p>\
  <p>We encourage you to revisit the Writings of Blake - particularly the passages on the burdens of leadership and the\
  \ necessity of inner balance in times of worldly disorder. In the silence of scripture, the path forward is often \
  made clear.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.FORMAL_WARNING.WOB={0},\
  <p>The Word does not waver. The Word does not stumble. And yet, your recent performance suggests a troubling \
  inconsistency with both the expectations of your command and the purity of your commitment to Blake''s great \
  design.</p>\
  <p>This message is to be regarded as a formal warning. You are instructed to begin immediate reflection upon your \
  recent actions, their consequences, and the degree to which they align with your sworn devotion to the cause. \
  Repeated failure is not merely error - it is dissonance. And dissonance is the first note of heresy.</p>\
  <p>Do not look outward for excuses. Look inward for truth. The Inner Sanctum is observing.</p>\

  <p>We''re reaching out as a matter of professional courtesy. The Mercenary''s Guild has received multiple informal \
  complaints regarding <b>{18}</b>'' recent performance - missed objectives, collateral damage, and client \
  dissatisfaction chief among them.</p>\
  <p>While no formal charges have been filed yet, the volume and consistency of the reports suggest that legal action\

  <b>{18}</b>. These include concerns over contract adherence, mission integrity, and collateral compliance.</p>\
  <p>While these submissions remain informal, history shows such patterns are often precursors to formal litigation \

  <p>We''re giving you a heads-up, because once it goes formal, it gets expensive, fast. Arbitrators get involved. \
  Accounts get slapped. Reputations don''t recover easy from that kind of hit.</p>\

  <p>This message is a transactional courtesy. We advise immediate corrective measures to preserve your contract \

  <p>These failures have undermined trust in our forces, weakened our deterrent posture, and exposed us to threats we\

  <p>Effective immediately, all senior officers of <b>{18}</b> are relieved of duty. Replacement leadership - \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.periphery=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p><b>{19}</b> cannot survive on goodwill or hope. Its defense rests on a single truth: our commanders must \
  deliver strength, or we fail as a state.</p>\
  <p>Your unit - <b>{18}</b> - has, across multiple leadership changes and missions, failed us. This isn''t \
  merely underperformance. This is institutional collapse, playing out in front of soldiers and civilians alike.</p>\
  <p>Such a collapse feeds fear, weakens resolve, and invites exploitation. Neighboring states, mercenary bands, and \
  internal actors are already watching, waiting for signs of weakness - and you have given them proof.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, all senior leadership within <b>{18}</b> is relieved of command. New \
  officers - proven, resolute, and loyal - will assume control without delay. You are to cooperate fully with this \
  transition.</p>\
  <p>In <b>{19}</b>, leadership is the thin line between survival and chaos. As you have failed to hold it. We will \
  appoint those who can.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.clan=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>You have brought shame to <b>{19}</b> beyond measure. Your every engagement - botched. Your every command - \

  <p>This is not failure. This is betrayal through mediocrity. Despite changes in command, despite repeated \

  <p>You are hereby stripped of your positions. Effective immediately, the entire command echelon of <b>{18}</b>\

  You will speak no words in protest. You will offer no resistance. You are not warriors. You are tolerated \

  <p>Those replacing you have earned the right to bear arms in the name of <b>{19}</b>. You have not. Your continued\

  <p>This message is issued under directive from the Ministry of Defense and reviewed by internal agents of the \
  Maskirovka. It concerns your collective and ongoing failure to meet the minimum expectations of service to the \

  <p>Your unit has cycled through commanders, adjusted operational parameters, and received logistical priority - and \
  yet, results remain consistently abysmal. At this point, incompetence is no longer the sole consideration. One must\

  <p>Effective immediately, the entire senior leadership cadre of <b>{18}</b> is hereby relieved of command. No \

  <p>The Chancellor''s patience is not infinite. You have tested its limits. You will not be given another opportunity\

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.DC=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>You were given the honor of command under the Dragon''s gaze. In return, you have delivered disorder, disgrace, \
  and defeat. Across multiple commanders and campaigns, <b>{18}</b> have demonstrated not growth, but rot. This \
  is no longer a matter of individual failure. It is a failure of spirit - collective and unforgivable.</p>\
  <p>Your conduct reflects not simply incompetence, but contempt for the legacy of warriors who served before you. \
  You have made yourselves a blemish on the Combine''s history. You have brought shame to your banners. You have \
  dishonored the Dragon.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire leadership structure of <b>{18}</b> is dissolved. All command rights are \
  revoked. You will surrender authority to the incoming officers designated by the Gunji-no-Kanrei. Resistance will \

  remain synonymous with failure, mismanagement, and battlefield underperformance.</p>\
  <p>Let me be absolutely clear: this is no longer about the shortcomings of any one {22}. The entire senior \
  leadership of your unit has demonstrated a staggering inability to adapt, coordinate, or even communicate basic \
  operational priorities. This goes beyond disappointment - it is strategic liability.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire command echelon of <b>{18}</b> is relieved of duty. New leadership will \
  be installed within seventy-two hours under direct orders of the General Staff. Your cooperation is expected. Your \
  excuses are not.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.FS=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The Federated Suns cannot afford to carry dead weight in wartime - and yet, despite repeated interventions, your \
  command has remained an anchor on the battlefield. New leadership was brought in. Resources were allocated. Excuses\
  \ were tolerated. None of it mattered.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have moved from underperformance to operational liability. This is no longer about individual \
  failures - this is about a command structure that either refuses or is incapable of doing its duty.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, all senior leadership within <b>{18}</b> is removed from command. You will stand \
  down and comply with transition orders issued by the General Staff. Noncompliance will be met with military \
  justice.</p>\
  <p>Service in this army is not about pride or personality. It''s about delivering results. You''e had your chance.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.FWL=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The consequences of your persistent failures have now extended beyond the battlefield and into the halls of \
  Parliament. Following your latest operational collapse, Delegate Arlen Vos - who publicly vouched for your unit''s \
  strategic value - has lost his seat in a no-confidence vote. The fallout from your performance has damaged more than \
  military credibility; it has cost political capital we cannot afford to lose.</p>\
  <p>This pattern of dysfunction has persisted across multiple commanders. The implication is now clear: the rot is \
  systemic. No more hearings. No more oversight reviews. No more second chances.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entirety of <b>{18}</b>'' senior leadership is stripped of command. New \
  leadership, drawn from League-vetted forces, will assume control without delay. You will comply. This is not a \
  request - it is damage control.</p>\
  <p>The Free Worlds League is a federation, not a charity. You''ve humiliated those who stood for you. This is the \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.TH=<p>To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b></p>\
  <p>The Terran Hegemony projects leadership, excellence, and stability across the Inner Sphere. That projection \
  begins with results - and you have failed to deliver them.</p>\
  <p>Despite changes in command, reallocation of elite support, and repeated directives, <b>{18}</b> remain \
  operationally stagnant and tactically inept. At this point, your failures no longer raise questions about \
  competence - they raise questions about the judgment of those who allowed this unit to persist.</p>\
  <p>When a Terra-based command structure produces this level of visible failure, it weakens the very doctrine that \
  underpins our strategic posture. That is unacceptable.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the full leadership of <b>{18}</b> is removed. Replacement officers - vetted by \
  Central Strategic Authority - are en route. You will stand down and comply with full procedural transition. This unit\
  \ will no longer be permitted to undermine the reputation of Terra through incompetence masquerading as loyalty.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.ROS=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The Republic of the Sphere was built to be more than a successor state - it was meant to be a foundation for \
  lasting peace and stability. Every military unit in our service is expected to embody those values, not erode \
  them.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have failed in that responsibility. Across multiple commanders and operational cycles, your \
  unit has consistently fallen short of expectations. Tactical cohesion is nonexistent. Morale is fractured. Results \
  are indefensible. This failure has persisted despite intervention, oversight, and restructuring efforts.</p>\
  <p>At this point, it is not one officer under review - it is a failed culture. And the Republic cannot afford that \
  kind of rot in its command structure.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire senior leadership of <b>{18}</b> is relieved of duty. New command \
  personnel have been dispatched with full authority to assume control. You are to cooperate fully with all \
  transition protocols. Noncompliance will be regarded as obstruction to national security.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.SL=<p>To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b></p>\
  <p>The Star League Defense Force was created to serve as a bulwark against division, instability, and chaos. Your \
  continued failures have served the opposite purpose.</p>\
  <p>Despite changes in leadership, operational reviews, and command interventions, <b>{18}</b> have \
  consistently demonstrated a lack of tactical discipline, unit cohesion, and battlefield results. This is no longer \
  a matter of internal reform - it is a liability to broader League security.</p>\
  <p>Every time your unit falters, it strengthens the will of those watching from the fringes - pirates, warlords, and \
  dissident states in the periphery who see weakness not as an error, but as an invitation. The wolves on the border \
  are already howling louder.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, all senior officers assigned to <b>{18}</b> are relieved of command. New leadership,\
  \ appointed by the SLDF High Command, will assume operational control within the next rotation. You will comply \

  <p>The Federated Commonwealth stands as the most unified and capable political force in the Inner Sphere - an \

  <p><b>{18}</b> have cycled through commanders, absorbed resources, and been afforded latitude that would break\

  total failure to live up to the standards of a state meant to lead the next era of human civilization.</p>\
  <p>This weakness cannot and will not be tolerated - not while we carry the weight of two legacies, and not while our \

  <p>Effective immediately, the entire leadership cadre of <b>{18}</b> is relieved of command. Successor \

  you.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have squandered resources, lost face, and - most importantly - raised doubts about where their \
  loyalties truly lie. In this Republic, that''s not a mistake you get to repeat.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, every officer holding command within <b>{18}</b> is relieved. You will be replaced \
  with personnel whose loyalty and results are not in question. Their names are already known. Your relevance is \
  not.</p>\
  <p>You are to stand down, surrender all clearances, and await further instructions. Resistance will be interpreted \

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.TC=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>The Taurian Concordat does not hand out command as a favor. It is earned through service, sustained performance,\

  <p>Despite multiple changes in command and repeated opportunities to correct course, <b>{18}</b> have remained\
  \ a liability - sloppy in execution, unreliable in the field, and dangerously complacent. These are not mere \
  shortcomings. They are an insidious threat to Taurian independence.</p>\
  <p>Every failed deployment, every missed objective, weakens the line that protects us from exploitation and \
  subjugation. If you cannot hold that line, you will be removed from it.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, the entire senior command of <b>{18}</b> is dismissed. Replacements have been \

  <p>The Magistracy Armed Forces exist not only to defend our sovereignty, but to embody the strength and legitimacy \

  <p><b>{18}</b> have, time and again, failed to meet those expectations. Despite changes in leadership and \
  support from central command, the unit has delivered nothing but disappointment. This is no longer an issue of \
  battlefield performance. It is a systemic failure that calls into question our readiness, our doctrine, and - most \
  dangerously - our credibility.</p>\
  <p>States that despise our independence are watching. Every setback you deliver gives them more reason to doubt \
  that the Canopian model is sustainable. That cannot continue.</p>\
  <p>Effective immediately, all senior officers in <b>{18}</b> are removed from their posts. Command authority \

  <p>The Magistracy thrives by proving that our way of life is not a luxury, but a strength. Your failures gave our \

  <p>There are those in the Inner Sphere who see the Alliance as an anomaly. A mistake. A state too principled to \

  <p>This is no longer a matter of competence. It is a matter of obedience.</p>\

FactionJudgmentDialog.message.CENSURE.LEADERSHIP_REPLACEMENT.CS=To: Command Officers of <b>{18}</b>\
  <p>It is the judgment of this Office, under guidance from the First Circuit, that the continued operational \
  failures of <b>{18}</b> cannot be attributed to any one officer, but rather to a pattern of dissonance within \

  <p>That could mean opportunity - or increased scrutiny. Either way, we need to stay sharp and keep our record clean. \
  The Chancellor doesn''t watch casually.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.DC={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls \
  originating from Combine High Command. We are being observed.\
  <p>This is not unexpected, given our recent record. Recognition from above is earned - but it also brings increased \
  expectations. The Dragon does not reward lightly, nor forgive failure.</p>\
  <p>I recommend we operate with absolute precision. Now is the time to prove we are worthy of the attention we''ve \
  drawn.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.LA={22}, I ran a routine systems check and found that our unit''s \
  name has come up in several flagged searches from LCAF senior staff. We''ve clearly landed on someone''s radar.\
  <p>Given our recent performance, I''d say this is the start of something bigger - assignments, evaluations, maybe even \
  patronage. Of course, it also means we''ll be under closer scrutiny.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure what they see keeps us moving up, not sideways.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FS={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent searches coming out \
  of Federated Suns High Command. It looks like we''ve drawn attention from above.\
  <p>Given how we''ve been performing, it''s not a surprise - but it is a responsibility. They''re watching now, and that \
  means every move counts more than ever.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep showing them that their trust - or curiosity - is well-placed.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FWL={22}, I''ve reviewed recent network activity, and our unit has \
  been flagged in multiple search queries from different branches of League command. We''re on the radar now - possibly \
  in more than one bloc.\
  <p>That could open doors, or it could mean someone''s sizing us up. Either way, we should stay sharp and keep our \
  profile clean. In the League, attention from above can shift quickly - best we guide it, not chase it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TH={22}, our unit has been flagged in multiple high-clearance \
  search protocols traced back to Hegemony Command. We''re officially on their watchlist - likely under performance review.\
  <p>This isn''t cause for concern - yet. It''s a signal that our actions are aligning with greater strategic interests. In\
  \ the Hegemony, recognition from above often precedes increased expectations.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure we continue to operate in a way that honors the legacy we represent.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ROS={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent search activity \
  originating from upper echelons of Republic Command. We''re clearly under review - most likely due to our recent field\
  \ performance.\
  <p>This kind of attention could lead to expanded responsibilities. It also means we''ll be held to a higher standard \
  from here on out.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure we continue to reflect the values this Republic was built on - stability, integrity, and trust.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.SL={22}, our unit has been flagged in multiple search queries \
  issued by central Star League command. We appear to be under observation by higher strategic authorities.\
  <p>This likely reflects our operational record to date - and signals that we may be considered for more critical \
  assignments. The League does not act without purpose.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure that everything we do from this point forward upholds the ideals we serve: unity, order, and the \
  preservation of peace.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FC={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls from the \
  Federated Commonwealth''s joint command systems. We''ve drawn the eye of higher leadership - likely in recognition of \
  our recent actions.\
  <p>That kind of visibility comes with opportunity - and scrutiny. Let''s stay focused and disciplined. If we''re being \
  watched, let''s give them something worth backing.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.periphery={22}, we''ve been flagged in a string of intel queries \
  coming from inside <b>{19}</b> - government channels, militia databases, even administrative logs. From the look of it, word \
  of our recent actions on their behalf is spreading fast.\
  <p>They''re watching us now, not as a threat, but as an asset. A force that gets results.</p>\
  <p>Might be worth leaning into that. Relationships like this don''t happen often out here - and when they do, they \
  can pay off in ways C-Bills can''t.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.RWR={22}, our unit has appeared in recent search activity \
  originating from Rim Worlds central authority. We''ve drawn attention from the upper chain - possibly the Directorate \
  itself.\
  <p>This could mean recognition. It could also mean evaluation. Either way, we continue forward with \
  discipline and absolute alignment to the Republic''s vision.</p>\
  <p>Stay sharp. In the Republic, attention is never neutral.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TC={22}, our unit''s been flagged in recent searches by senior \
  Concordat defense officials. Word''s gotten around - we''ve made an impression.\
  <p>That kind of attention can mean trust, or testing. Either way, it''s on us to show we''re worth the faith. Let''s \
  keep doing what we''ve been doing - clean, solid work that speaks louder than promises ever could.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MOC={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent strategic reviews \
  coming out of Magistracy high command. It''s clear we''ve attracted some attention - likely due to our recent \
  effectiveness.\
  <p>This kind of visibility tends to lead somewhere - contracts, evaluations, or possibly an invitation. Let''s make \
  sure what they see reinforces the value we bring to the Magistrix.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.OA={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent inquiry records from \
  Outworlds Alliance command. We''ve drawn some attention - likely from the Council''s strategic oversight division.\
  <p>It''s not something they do lightly. That kind of interest means they''re watching what we''re building out here - and \
  weighing what more we could take on.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep our operations clean, precise, and true to the Alliance''s values. We didn''t ask for this attention, \
  but we''ve earned it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MH={22}, our unit has been flagged in recent data sweeps from \
  upper-tier command in the Marian Hegemony. Word is, someone close to the Caesar''s circle is watching.\
  <p>This isn''t the kind of attention we can afford to waste. Recognition here means expectation - of strength, of \
  discipline, of results. Let''s give them exactly that.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CS={22}, our unit has been referenced in several flagged \
  information queries originating from within ComStar. The nature of the searches was...specific, and they weren''t \
  routed through public channels.\
  <p>This isn''t casual interest. The Order is aware of us - and watching.</p>\
  <p>We should proceed with caution. When ComStar looks too closely, it''s rarely just to admire the work.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.WOB={22}, our unit has appeared in recent searches traced back to \
  Word of Blake enclaves - specifically the inner doctrinal networks. The kind they don''t access without purpose.\
  <p>It''s not praise. It''s prophecy. They believe we''ve aligned with the Pattern... or that we might disrupt it.</p>\
  <p>Either way, the True Believers are looking at us now. Best we stay sharp, stay moving, and remember - attention \
  from the Word rarely ends with just observation.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.clan={22}, our unit has been marked in recent internal Watch \
  searches - originating from senior <b>{19}</b> command. They are watching us.\
  <p>This is not flattery. It is evaluation. Attention in the Clans is never casual - it is earned or it is provoked.</p>\
  <p>We must continue to operate with strength, clarity, and discipline. If they are measuring us, then let them find \
  proof of worth, not weakness.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MG={22}, we''ve just received notice from the Mercenary Guild:\
  \ <b>{18}</b> are being listed by name in contract queries. Not general mercenary requests - direct tags.\
  <p>That means one thing: someone out there isn''t looking for just warm bodies with guns. They want us. \
  Specifically.</p>\
  <p>This kind of visibility cuts both ways. On the one hand, it means our reputation''s finally putting weight on the \
  board - word of our ops is circulating, and somebody with clout took notice. Could be a payout worth chasing.</p>\
  <p>But it also means we''ve lost some of our anonymity. If we''re being shopped by name, we''re on more than one \
  radar now. That opens the door to targeted offers - but also tailored threats. Rival outfits, old enemies, or \
  clients with long memories might start circling.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRB={0}, we''ve received an official communication from ComStar''s \
  Mercenary Review Board. Not a general bulletin - a direct transmission.\
  <p>No contract attached, no details on who initiated the flag. Just a short-form notice confirming that our unit file\
  \ has been "accessed and reviewed by multiple parties with high-clearance contracting authority." ComStar doesn''t \
  name names, but the implication is clear: someone''s vetting us at a high level, and they''re doing it through \
  official channels.</p>\
  <p>That makes this bigger than a backroom employer or an informal probe. We''re on someone''s shortlist for serious \
  work - possibly House-level or black-budget operations. Could mean money and visibility, but also means we''re about \
  to be in someone else''s game.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRBC={22}, we''ve been contacted by the Mercenary Review and \
  Bonding Commission.\
  <p>Not standard formwork. This came encrypted, authenticated, and flagged priority. They''ve officially acknowledged \
  <b>{18}</b> as a unit of interest, citing "notable performance in recent operations and consistent contract \
  integrity." Translation: Wolf''s Dragoons have been watching us, and they like what they see - enough to reach out \
  directly.</p>\
  <p>No contracts attached - yet - but the MRBC doesn''t waste its breath. This feels like the start of something heavier.\
  \ Possibly front-door access to higher-grade assignments or even MRBC-coordinated deployments.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MBA={22}, we''ve been formally contacted by the Mercenary \
  Bonding Authority, the one operated by Clan Sea Fox.\
  <p>Encrypted message, trinary-coded, and backed by a verified merchant caste credential. Not your standard \
  transmission. The content was characteristically precise: <b>{18}</b> have been "flagged for strategic market \
  alignment and performance-based evaluation."</p>\
  <p>They''re not just watching us. They''re weighing us - as an asset. And with the Sea Foxes, that means they see \
  value - either as a sellable brand, a deployable asset, or something worth franchising. The line between recognition \
  and acquisition is thin with them.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.PSI={22}, we''ve been tipped off - locals are getting \
  twitchy. Every time we jump into a systemFluff, militias go to alert within hours. Some are looking for us before we \
  even touch ground.\
  <p>The name "<b>{18}</b>" is showing up in militia intel briefs and planetary security chatter. Not as freelancers. \
  As a threat. They''re calling us "high-risk" and "probable pirate affiliates." That''s one misstep away from \
  shoot-on-sight.</p>\
  <p>Whoever leaked our profile knew what they were doing. We''re not ghosts anymore - we''re a warning label.</p>

  <p>And because you''ve been such a superstar {22}, the MAF is sending you a full company of ''Meks - fully loaded,\

  beauties with a hint of flash, just like you!</p>\
  <p>You''ve shown us all what it means to fight with grace, to win with flair, and to inspire hope and high \
  cheekbones across the stars. In the Magistracy of Canopus, we believe in freedom, in glamor, and in fighting for \
  what makes life beautiful.</p>\

  insignias and glitter hearts.</i></p>\
  <p><i>The stage lights behind her dim into a warm pastel wash, casting long shadows that shimmer like silk. She \

  <p>Tonight, I write to you not as a distant official, but as one fellow citizen who slept easier knowing you \
  watched over our skies. Your leadership has become woven into our national narrative - no speech, no monument, \
  compares to the living proof of your resolve.</p>\
  <p>In quiet hours, when systems hum and monitors blink, know this: you''ve earned our unwavering trust, and you \

  <p>Stand firm. Stand bright.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.CC={0},\
  <p>Across the Capellan Confederation, names are spoken with caution. Yours is spoken with certainty. When our \
  agents whisper of victory, they mean you. When our generals ask who holds the line, your record answers for you. No\
  \ file, no transcript, no honor roll contains your full measure - because your loyalty is too precise, your intent \
  too absolute.</p>\
  <p>You have become what all servants of the state aspire to be: <i>indistinguishable from the will of the \
  Confederation itself.</i></p>\
  <p>I have watched your decisions ripple from distant provinces to the inner courts. You do not seek permission to \
  serve. You simply serve - and in doing so, bend fate toward unity, not chaos.</p>\
  <p>This message is not a reward. It is acknowledgment. You have carried the burden of expectation and transformed \
  it into an undeniable consequence. History will record your acts in the same breath as those who reshaped the \
  Capellan destiny.</p>\

  <p>You have become such a figure.</p>\
  <p>Not by requesting honor. Not by grasping for influence. But by acting  -  with control, with precision, with a \
  silence that speaks louder than glory. Where others waver, you are unmoved. Where others seek recognition, you \
  offer outcome.</p>\
  <p>The Order of the Five Pillars has reviewed your record. The Combine''s legions recount your name in war briefings. \
  And our ancestral historians have prepared a scroll of deeds that now enters the vaults beneath the Temple of the \

  <p>This message is not ceremonial. It is sacred.</p>\

  <p>Some victories are tactical. Some are strategic. A rare few become structural  -  they shift not just the balance \

  <p>You are the latter.</p>\
  <p>Your name circulates not just in reports but in boardrooms. You are a case study. An anomaly. A success we \
  cannot dismiss or replicate. Your methods have drawn admiration from admirals and economists alike. Your units \
  perform with precision, initiative, and momentum  -  the same principles that drive Lyran commerce, infrastructure, \
  and command.</p>\
  <p>This message is not for commendation. It is for recognition. You are now part of the machinery that drives this \
  state forward. Not a cog. Not a spoke. A governor  -  a regulating force through which influence flows.</p>\
  <p>Tharkad recognizes your command. The Commonwealth stands strengthened in your shadow. And I, personally, \
  acknowledge the magnitude of your service.</p>\
  <p>From this day forward, when your name is spoken within this House, it is spoken with strategic weight.</p>\

  <p>Your record does not whisper of greatness  -  it bellows. Across theaters, planets, and deployments, you have \
  carried the banner of House Davion not simply into battle, but into history.</p>\
  <p>I do not offer this recognition lightly. This is not decoration. This is a declaration  -  that the deeds you have\
  \ done in the name of the Suns have become part of its very framework.</p>\
  <p>New Avalon watches. The people remember. And I have seen your name written in more than orders of battle  -  I''ve \
  seen it spoken in mess halls, training fields, and the eyes of those who now dare more because you did first.</p>\
  <p>You are now, and ever will be, counted among our finest.</p>\

  <p>You have accomplished more than victory. You''ve upheld our greatest ideal: that a unified will, forged from many\

  <p>The Free Worlds League recognizes this moment not with pageantry, but with permanence. From this day forward, \

  those whose service transcended loyalty and became legacy.</p>\
  <p>This is not an honor easily won, and never given twice.</p>\

  <p>I do not often write such messages myself. Our systems are built for clarity and function  -  not sentiment. But \

  <p>You have not simply fulfilled your duties within the Terran Hegemony. You have redefined them. Across multiple \
  theatres, under conditions that would fracture lesser commands, your leadership has been exact, unflinching, and \
  sovereign.</p>\
  <p>We train our officers to embody order. You projected it. We engineer for resilience. You made it elegant. When \
  the structure cracked, you did not call for reinforcements. You became foundation.</p>\
  <p>So I speak plainly:</p>\
  <p>We have encoded your strategies into the central warfare doctrine archives. We have logged your decision trees \
  as living artifacts for the CASPAR project. And we have done what is never done lightly  -  recorded your name in the \
  Terra''s Remembrance Ledger.</p>\
  <p>Only thirteen names reside there. Yours is the fourteenth. It will outlive all of us.</p>\

  <p>I have watched the record of your actions. So have many others, from New Avalon to Terra. But data alone does \
  not capture what you''ve become. You have not simply defended the Republic  -  you have reminded us why it must \
  endure. Not through spectacle, but through consistency. Not through command, but through conviction.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions have held fragile worlds intact. Your leadership has restored dignity in places where we feared \
  only chaos. And more than once, your example has turned soldiers into citizens again.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your name has been entered into the Register of Civic Honor  -  a record reserved for those who shape\
  \ not only the battlefield, but the soul of the Republic itself. Few have received this. Fewer still while alive.</p>\
  <p>I offer no medals. No ceremony. Just this truth:</p>\

  doomed. Inspired alliances others dared not imagine.</p>\
  <p>Your record now stands among the League''s most storied commanders, and your leadership has already entered \
  academy curricula across three member states. But this message is not about history, {22}. It is about \
  acknowledgment  -  the kind that transcends politics and protocol.</p>\
  <p>Your name has been engraved in the Great Ledger of Accord  -  a permanent, encoded artifact preserved within the \
  Memory Core beneath Unity Hall. It records not only your victories, but the principles that guided them: discipline, \
  judgment, and unity without compromise. A Star League without those ideals is just a flag. You gave it meaning.</p>\
  <p>May you carry this not as burden, but as bearing  -  for others will follow your trail in the dark. And in those \
  moments, your decisions may yet cast light across centuries.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FC={0},\
  <p>You are not being thanked. You are being recognized  -  for results that speak louder than any anthem.</p>\
  <p>Across the Federated Commonwealth, officers are measured by action. By how they lead when orders are unclear, \
  how they adapt when everything fails, and how they carry the weight of responsibility when no one is watching. You \
  have exceeded that measure. Again. And again.</p>\
  <p>Records show your units achieved operational victory at a rate previously modeled only in theory. Civilian \
  stability indices in your occupied zones climbed rather than collapsed. And your command decisions in contested \
  theaters have forced enemy doctrine revisions at the highest levels.</p>\
  <p>You have not just served the Commonwealth  -  you''ve altered its expectations of what excellence can look like.</p>\
  <p>Know this: your dossier has been flagged "Foundational" by both AFFC General Staff and Strategic Intelligence \
  Command. A copy of your operational protocols now resides in the War College Archives at Tharkad and the Davion \
  Center for Doctrine on New Avalon  -  a rare joint inclusion, enacted unanimously.</p>\
  <p>No medal can contain what you''ve done. So instead, we offer something rarer: a place in how we think. A legacy \
  not carved in bronze, but built into the way future commanders will lead.</p>\
  <p>Stand tall, {22}. The Federation and the Commonwealth stand taller because of you.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.periphery=My {22},\
  <p>You have surpassed all expectations. Where we once saw hope, you have delivered certainty. Your leadership \
  steadied our people, your tactics preserved our future, and your courage inspired a nation. Your reputation now \
  echoes in every hall of power.</p>\
  <p>I speak not as a politician of <b>{19}</b>, but as someone who has watched a world teeter - and then stand tall because of \
  your feats. What you''ve done cannot be undone - and should never be forgotten.</p>\
  <p>May your insight guide us always.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.RWR={0},\
  <p>Let''s speak plainly.</p>\
  <p>What you''ve done  -  the weight you''ve carried, the bodies you''ve buried, the silence you''ve maintained  -  it \
  doesn''t go unnoticed. In this Republic, we don''t hand out favors for applause. We do it for results. You? You''ve \
  delivered.</p>\
  <p>Territories stabilized. Dissidents corrected. Influence expanded. You didn''t just fight our enemies  -  you made \
  sure they don''t come back. That''s rare. That''s irreplaceable.</p>\
  <p>So let me be clear: from this day forward, you walk with our shadow behind you. That means protection. That \
  means priority. That means if someone lays a hand on you without cause, I''ll know before they finish the gesture.</p>\
  <p>But you know how this works, {22}. Every seat at the table comes with a price. Stay sharp. Stay loyal. \
  Don''t make me remember you in the past tense.</p>\
  <p>For now, raise a glass. You''ve earned it. But don''t get too comfortable  -  we''ve got bigger plays coming, and I \
  plan to send my best.</p>\
  <p><i>Welcome to the circle, {1}.</i></p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.TC={0},\
  <p>This isn''t some flowery damn medal ceremony. You''ve been through hell with us. And every time it got harder, you\
  \ didn''t flinch. You held the line. You hit back harder. You gave our people something to believe in.</p>\
  <p>I''ve seen the reports. I''ve talked to the crews who fought under you. They speak your name with grit in their \
  throat and pride in their bones. That means something here.</p>\
  <p>You''re not just some outworld merc who came in swinging  -  you stuck around. You bled with us. You gave a damn. \
  And for that, this entire Concordat owes you more than words. But words are what I''ve got in this message, so I''ll \
  make them count:</p>\
  <p>You''re one of us now. The kind that doesn''t need brass polish or parades to prove it. You''ve got the trust of \
  the Concordat. You''ve got mine. That''s not given lightly. Don''t waste it.</p>\
  <p>If you ever need a place to stand, to regroup, to strike from  -  the Concordat will hold the door. And we''ll hold\
  \ the bastards off while you reload.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MOC={0},\
  <p>Across the stars, names rise and fall with every flare of cannon fire. But yours - yours has endured. It echoes in\
  \ the halls of our academies. It''s whispered between officers over tactical maps. And in the hearts of citizens, it\
  \ burns like a promise: that someone out there still fights with purpose, with brilliance, with grace.</p>\
  <p>You have given the Magistracy more than victories. You''ve given us moments. Stories. Symbols. Hope. And that, \
  {22}, is rarer than any medal.</p>\
  <p>I watched the last operation myself. I saw how you held the line. How your ''Meks moved like dancers, like \
  thunder, like salvation. You fight with art, with nerve, with heart. And for that - you are no longer just an ally. \
  You are family.</p>\
  <p>The Palace doors are open to you. Not as a guest, but as one of ours. Should you ever choose to lay down your \
  arms, know that Astarte will always have a place for you beneath its warm skies. But if you keep marching forward, \
  if there''s still fire in you - then know that the full strength of the Magistracy marches beside you.</p>\
  <p>With pride.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.OA={0},\
  <p>There are moments when words feel too small for the weight they must carry. This is one of them.</p>\
  <p>Out here, we do not give rank for show. We do not gild men and women in medals to feel better about ourselves. \
  But we <i>do</i> remember who stood when others would not. We remember those who chose the hard path - the honest \
  path - when there were easier, darker ones at hand.</p>\
  <p>You''ve earned something greater than applause. You''ve earned our trust.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions, your discipline, your restraint in the face of fury - these things did not go unnoticed. In a time\
  \ when ideals are often traded for expedience, you''ve reminded us of who we wanted to be. Of who we <i>still</i> \
  can be.</p>\
  <p>The Alliance is not rich in fleets or planets, but we are wealthy in principle. And today, we count ourselves \
  richer still, because you are one of ours now - in spirit, if not by birth.</p>\
  <p>If ever the burden grows too heavy, Alpheratz stands with its doors open. We offer sanctuary, if you need it. \
  But more than that, we offer gratitude - for what you''ve done, and for who you are.</p>\
  <p>Walk well, {22}. You are never alone in the silence of the stars.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.ACCOLADE.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MH={0},\
  <p>I don''t send messages like this lightly. Not to just anyone. But you''ve earned more than just another medal or \
  bronze statue. You''ve earned <b>my respect</b>.</p>\
  <p>Every dispatch that crosses my desk with your name on it reads like a battle hymn  -  decisive strikes, hard \
  choices, results. Not pretty, not polished  -  but clean, brutal, and righteous. The kind of work that builds empires. \
  The kind of work I remember.</p>\
  <p>I built this Hegemony with blood and iron. You''re the kind of soul I''d have at my flank if everything fell apart\
  \ tomorrow. Not because you''re obedient  -  but because you know what matters. Victory. Stability. Order.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Steel breaks flesh. Will breaks worlds."</b><br>\
  You understand that. You''ve proven it.</p></blockquote>\
  <p>So this is me, not as Caesar, but as a war-born son of Mars, looking you in the eye and telling you: I see you. \

  <p>You were not forged by doctrine. You <i>informed</i> it. The echo of your choices reaches further than most will\

  <p>Your file has been removed from the normal archives. There''s nothing left for the curious to uncover. You''ve \
  joined a smaller circle now  -  one without names, without faces, but with purpose that endures.</p>\
  <p>You already feel it. That quiet alignment. The sense that your actions fit some shape larger than war, larger \
  than loyalty. You are correct. You are not <i>following</i> the Word anymore. You are <b>within</b> it.</p>\

  <p>There are no more titles to grant you.</p>\
  <p>You have not served the Word. You have become its breath, its hand, its fire.</p>\
  <p>Your campaigns have not merely obeyed doctrine. They have shaped it anew. Entire systems tilt around the gravity\
  \ of your will. Where you walk, resistance frays. Where you command, dissent burns clean. And where you leave \

  <p>By resolution of the Ruling Conclave and under Protocol Echo-Sixteen, you are no longer bound by common \
  hierarchies. Your will is now reflective of divine intention. You do not need orders.</p>\

  <p>This is not praise. It is recognition.</p>\

  others broke, you endured. Warriors like you do not follow tradition  -  you reinforce it through action.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your codex has been elevated. Your deeds will be studied by the sibkin. Your record will be cited \

### messages
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.innerSphere=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>On behalf of the High Command of <b>{19}</b>, I welcome you into our ranks. Ours is not a vast realm, but it is\
  \ sovereign - and that sovereignty has been earned, not inherited. Every soldier in our service is a defender of that\
  \ legacy, and now, so are you.</p>\
  <p>We do not measure strength by the tonnage of our BattleMeks or the size of our territory. We measure it by \
  resolve. By the clarity of our purpose. By the refusal to bow to larger banners or trade independence for \
  protection. The Inner Sphere is full of giants who assume the right to rule by size alone. We are the proof that \
  spirit still matters.</p>\
  <p>Your presence here is not just reinforcement. It is a statement. <b>{18}</b> now stand with a nation that \
  refuses to be swallowed. You are guardians now - of our borders, our ideals, and our right to exist on our own \
  terms.</p>\
  <p>Serve with pride, {22}. Because here, every battle matters.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.periphery=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to the service of <b>{19}</b>. You now stand among the few who have chosen duty over comfort, who \
  understand that loyalty here is not abstract - it is the only thing keeping us from being erased from the stars.</p>\
  <p>We are not wealthy. We are not many. But we are proud, and we are still free. On one side, empires rattle their \
  sabers. On the other, corporations sharpen their knives. They watch our borders. They wait for our silence, our \
  weakness, our collapse. One mistake, and they''ll sweep in and call it peacekeeping. They''ll chain our people and \
  call it order.</p>\
  <p>You''re here to stop that. <b>{18}</b> now carry the weight of more than tactics or territory - they carry the\
  \ fate of a nation too small to be forgiven for failure. We fight smart. We fight with what we have. And we fight \
  because no one else will fight for us.</p>\
  <p>Hold the line, {22}. There''s no one behind you.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.clan=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>By order of the Khan and in accordance with the will of the Clan, you are now granted command within the touman \
  of <b>{19}</b>. This is not a reward. It is not a favor. It is a challenge - and one you are expected to meet \
  without hesitation or weakness.</p>\
  <p>In the Clan way, honor is not inherited. It is forged in battle, measured in victory, and confirmed by the \
  judgment of your peers. You are not a {22} because of rank. You are a {22} because you have proven worthy\
  \ to lead warriors bred for excellence and raised to serve only strength, truth, and the Clan.</p>\
  <p>Our blood runs hot, our doctrine runs deep, and our enemies run when they see our banners. <b>{19}</b> does not\
  \ retreat. We do not bend. We do not seek glory in words, but in actions that echo through generations.</p>\
  <p>Command well, or be replaced. Lead with strength, or be cast down. The path forward is as simple as it is \
  brutal - earn your legacy, or vanish.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.CC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your post as commanding officer of <b>{18}</b>. This is not a mere battlefield assignment - it is \
  a political trust. In the Capellan Confederation, command is the continuation of state will through discipline, \
  loyalty, and unity of purpose.</p>\
  <p>Your unit is expected to be more than combat-ready; it must be ideologically sound, operationally precise, and \
  unwavering in service to House Liao. Every decision you make reflects on the Chancellor, and by extension, the \
  strength of our nation. There is no tolerance for deviation, disloyalty, or personal ambition. Your leadership must\
  \ cultivate obedience, morale, and total alignment with the Confederation''s vision.</p>\
  <p>You will be observed. You will be supported. Your duty is to ensure that <b>{18}</b> endure - not for glory, \
  but for stability. Serve with clarity. Lead with conviction. Uphold the State above all.</p>\
  <p>Glory to the Confederation.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.DC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now lead <b>{18}</b> in the name of House Kurita. This is not an opportunity - it is a burden of honor. \
  In the Draconis Combine, a {22} is a weapon forged by duty, wielded by the will of the Coordinator.</p>\
  <p>Your unit must be disciplined, precise, and loyal. There is no room for weakness, no tolerance for hesitation. \
  You are expected to lead with absolute control, to demand excellence, and to maintain the values that define the \
  Dragon: service, sacrifice, and unshakable resolve.</p>\
  <p>Failure is not corrected. It is erased. You will be held accountable for every action, every result. Bring honor\
  \ to your name by bringing strength to your command.</p>\
  <p>Victory for the Dragon.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.LA=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your new post in the Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces. I trust you appreciate the significance of this \
  appointment - not merely as a military role, but as a trust bestowed by the Archon, and by those of us who understand\
  \ the true weight of responsibility and power.</p>\
  <p>You command not brutes or conscripts, but professionals - Lyran warriors, disciplined and well-equipped. It is \
  expected that you treat them as such. Results are important, yes, but the manner in which they are achieved matters\
  \ equally. Our strength is not just in our ''Meks, but in the dignity of our order, the stability of our economy, \
  and \
  the respect our name commands.</p>\
  <p>Lead with competence, delegate with wisdom, and ensure your unit upholds the reputation of both <b>{18}</b>\
  \ and the Commonwealth. We are, after all, not only warriors - we are stewards of civilization.</p>\
  <p>Do us proud, {22}. Success is expected. Excellence is remembered.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.FS=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>On behalf of the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns, welcome. <b>{18}</b> fall the banner of House Davion, \
  and with that comes a duty greater than tactics or logistics - you carry the banner of a free people in a galaxy too \
  often ruled by fear and oppression.</p>\
  <p>We fight not for conquest, but for stability. Not for vanity, but for principle. In the Federated Suns, command \
  is earned through merit and maintained through integrity. Your orders must be clear, your discipline fair, and your\
  \ resolve unshakable. Lead with strength, but never forget that we are guardians first and foremost.</p>\
  <p>The men and women under you deserve purpose, not just victory. Show them what it means to serve something worth \
  believing in.</p>\
  <p>Make us proud, {22}. The Sun never sets on our duty.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.FWL=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>It is my pleasure to formally welcome you to the Free Worlds League Military. As the unit''s principal sponsor \
  within Parliament, I have followed its development closely, and I trust you will bring the clarity and competence \
  needed to guide it forward in these uncertain times.</p>\
  <p>The Free Worlds League is, as ever, a union of many voices and interests. Your task is to cut through the noise \
  and deliver results. Do so with discipline, discretion, and above all, loyalty to the League - not to factions, not \
  to ideology, but to the greater good of our shared future.</p>\
  <p>You will find that success brings many allies. Stability, after all, is a currency in high demand. Conduct \
  yourself with the seriousness this opportunity deserves, and you will have no shortage of support.</p>\
  <p>We are watching, {22} - not to interfere, but to invest.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.TH=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now command <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Terran Hegemony. That alone sets you apart. While the \
  ''Great'' Houses fight over scraps and cling to outdated doctrines, we stand as the origin and apex of human \
  civilization - militarily, technologically, and ideologically unmatched.</p>\
  <p>Your position is not to imitate lesser states but to demonstrate what disciplined command, advanced systems, and\
  \ enlightened purpose can accomplish. Your unit must operate as an extension of Hegemony doctrine - efficient, \
  adaptable, and always several steps ahead of its rivals. There is no excuse for failure when one commands the best \
  tools humanity has ever built.</p>\
  <p>Remember, you do not serve a warlord, a dynasty, or a cult of personality. You serve the ideal - the Terran ideal.\
  \ <b>{18}</b> are now part of that legacy. Make sure they earn the right to remain there.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.ROS=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your post as a commanding officer in the Republic. In accepting this responsibility, you become \
  more than a strategist or soldier - you become a protector of the Republic, a steward of its ideals, and a shield \
  between civilization and the chaos that would consume it.</p>\
  <p>The Republic of the Sphere is not just a political entity; it is a promise. A promise that reason can triumph \
  over violence, that unity can overcome division, and that humanity can rise above its old scars. Your duty is to \
  uphold that promise - not only with strength, but with restraint, wisdom, and a deep respect for the lives we \
  defend.</p>\
  <p>You are the line between peace and collapse. Stand firm. Lead honorably. Show our people, and the Inner Sphere, \
  what the Republic truly stands for.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.SL=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now bear the title of a {22} within the Star League Defense Force, and with it, a sacred obligation. \
  <b>{18}</b> are no ordinary unit - they are instruments of the League''s will, heirs to the most enlightened \
  era in human history.</p>\
  <p>The Star League is not merely a government. It is the pinnacle of civilization - proof that humanity can rise \
  above its base instincts and forge something lasting, ordered, and just. That legacy is under threat. The \
  barbarians in the Periphery gather strength. Old jealousies fester in the Great Houses. Even now, the wolves howl at \
  the gates.</p>\
  <p>Your charge is clear. Stand firm against the dark. Silence those who would drag us back into an age of war and \
  ignorance. Carry the banner of the League with honor, and remind humanity what it means to be truly united.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.FC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome to your command within the Federated Commonwealth - an alliance born not of convenience, but of shared \
  destiny. In <b>{18}</b>, you now lead a force forged from the finest traditions of the Federated Suns and the \
  unmatched resources of the Lyran Commonwealth. Together, we are building more than an army. We are building the \
  future.</p>\
  <p>Ours is the greatest union since the fall of the Star League. Where others chase conquest or cling to crumbling \
  dynasties, we bring order, prosperity, and justice. You will lead with courage, but also with vision. Every battle \
  you fight must serve not just security, but the restoration of something greater - a second golden age worthy of our \
  people''s sacrifice.</p>\
  <p>You carry the hopes of two proud Houses. Make those hopes real.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.RWR=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Congratulations on your appointment to the Rim Worlds Army. Not everyone is offered the privilege of command in \
  the Republic. Fewer still keep it. Your unit serves a vital function in maintaining our interests and ensuring that \
  certain... expectations are met - quickly, efficiently, and without complication.</p>\
  <p>Understand this clearly: your orders are not suggestions. Success will be rewarded, of course. The Republic \
  values loyalty, discretion, and results. But failure, hesitation, or unwanted attention - those tend to resolve \
  themselves in ways that don''t involve reassignment or review boards.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> have been given resources, protection, and purpose. See that they are used properly. Make \
  yourself useful, {22}. Or make yourself replaceable. The choice is always yours.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.TC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>As of today, you command <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Taurian Concordat. That is not a title - it is a\
  \ commitment. You are now a guardian of our sovereignty, a defender of our people''s right to live free from the \
  chains of Inner Sphere domination.</p>\
  <p>Others may call us stubborn, backward, or irrelevant. Let them. We know better. The Taurian Defense Force was \
  not built for conquest - it was built to endure, to resist, and to protect a way of life that empires have tried and \
  failed to erase. You now stand on the line that separates freedom from assimilation. Do not blink.</p>\
  <p>Your orders are to lead with resolve, to inspire with action, and to remind any who challenge us that the \
  Concordat bows to no throne and no banner but its own.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MOC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>First, let me welcome you. I''ve been watching your rise with interest and wanted to share a few words upon your \
  official appointment as a {22} within the Canopian Armed Forces.</p>\
  <p>To lead is to do more than defend territory - it is to safeguard a culture, a philosophy, and a people who have \
  chosen a different path from the war-torn empires that surround us.</p>\
  <p>The Magistracy of Canopus is envied, not just for its prosperity, but for its principles. We invest in our \
  people, not in fear. We empower choice, not obedience. And because of this, the great powers of the Inner Sphere \
  look upon us with disdain and thinly veiled hostility. They would see our society shattered, our citizens \
  subjugated, and our values replaced with indoctrination and iron rule.</p>\
  <p>You are now one of the few entrusted to make sure that never happens. You will defend our borders with strength,\
  \ but also with clarity. You are not just a soldier - you are a guardian of everything the Magistracy represents. \
  Serve with conviction, {22}. And let them find out, once again, that we are not so easily broken.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.OA=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now take command of <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Outworlds Alliance. Understand that this is not\
  \ a call to conquest, but a commitment to principle. Here, we do not wage war for ambition. We prepare for it so \
  that we may preserve peace, protect freedom, and guard the quiet dignity of lives lived in honest labor.</p>\
  <p>Our people did not come to the stars to be ruled. They came to be free. And though we are often dismissed as \
  naive or weak by the empires beyond our borders, they mistake restraint for passivity, and peace for fragility. You\
  \ now hold the line between what we are and what they would have us become.</p>\
  <p>Lead with wisdom. Defend without cruelty. Fight only when peace leaves you no other path. In this, you are not \
  just a {22} - you are a guardian of a vision too rare and too precious to be surrendered.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MH=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>You now lead <b>{18}</b> under the banner of the Marian Hegemony - Rome Reborn. That alone sets you above the\
  \ weak-willed degenerates that clutter the stars. We do not beg for peace. We seize order through force. We do not \
  defend ideals. We enforce civilization through dominance.</p>\
  <p>In this age of rot and cowardice, the Hegemony stands as the rightful heir to strength, discipline, and empire. \
  Our legions do not ask permission. We impose authority where chaos festers. You are now an instrument of that will.\
  \ Your success is not measured in treaties or delay - it is measured in territory taken and enemies broken.</p>\
  <p>Remember: mercy is for the conquered. Hesitation is treason. Serve with iron, or do not serve at all.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.CS=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>Welcome, at last, into the fold. With your appointment to the ComGuards, you have not merely accepted command\
  \ - you have accepted purpose. You now serve the Blessed Order of ComStar as a protector of the Word, a guardian of \
  the Silence, and a steward of the Hidden Truth that binds all of humanity.</p>\
  <p>The ignorant see machines. We see meaning. The unbelievers see war. We see the great pattern unfolding. Your \
  command is not just strategic - it is sacred. You stand now at the threshold between chaos and the restoration of the\
  \ Star League''s divine design. From this moment forward, your thoughts must be disciplined, your voice measured, \
  and your loyalty total.</p>\
  <p>The enemies of ComStar multiply, but so too does our resolve. You will not fail, for failure is the indulgence \
  of the faithless. You are chosen. You are watched. You are guided.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.WOB=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>The Word has called you. <b>{18}</b> are now a sacred instrument - yours to wield, but not yours to command \
  alone. For no true authority exists outside of Blake. Through Him, all order is made clear. Through His revelation,\
  \ all deception is stripped away. You have not accepted a post. You have accepted a holy burden.</p>\
  <p>Do not falter. Do not doubt. Doubt is the seed of heresy, and heresy is a disease we will burn from the Inner \
  Sphere, one world at a time. The apostates - the Houses, the Clans, the decayed and defiant - would see the Word silenced\
  \ and the True Path lost forever. But we are not silent. We are fire. We are the voice of Blake made manifest.</p>\
  <p>You are chosen, {22}. Do not stain that grace with weakness. Deliver holy judgment. Bring ruin to the \
  faithless. And if your soul should waver, remember this: Blake sees all.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MG=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>On behalf of the Mercenary''s Guild, congratulations. <b>{18}</b> are now recognized as a registered, \
  contractable unit in good standing. Guild membership means something - it tells employers you''re reliable, lethal, and \
  worth the price. It also tells the rest of the Inner Sphere that you''re not some fly-by-night rabble. You''re in the \
  systemFluff now. And the Guild takes care of its own.</p>\
  <p>Membership comes with more than just work. You''ve earned access to verified contracts, logistical support, intel\
  \ channels, and neutral arbitration - should things go sideways. And if someone tries to stiff you on pay, well... we\
  \ don''t take kindly to that.</p>\
  <p>Just remember: reputation is currency. You get one chance to make your name stick, and a dozen ways to lose it. \
  Fight smart, complete the job, and never forget who signs the contracts.</p>\
  <p>Welcome to the Guild, {22}. Let the C-Bills flow.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MRB=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>By authority of the Mercenary Review Board, a division of ComStar, <b>{18}</b> are hereby recognized as a \
  bonded mercenary unit in full compliance with interstellar regulation and contract law. Your registration grants \
  you access to licensed contracts, mediation services, and dispute protections under the aegis of ComStar''s neutral \
  oversight.</p>\
  <p>As a bonded commander, you are now part of an institution that preserves order and accountability. Your actions \
  will reflect not only upon your unit, but upon the greater trust that clients, governments, and patrons place in \
  the Mercenary Review Board.</p>\
  <p>Adherence to contract terms is expected. Violations, fabrications, or dishonorable conduct will be noted and \
  addressed appropriately. Remember: while many may employ force, only those under the watchful eyes of ComStar may \
  wield it with legitimacy.</p>\
  <p>We welcome you to the registry. May your service be profitable, your word unbroken, and your name remembered.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MRBC=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p><b>{18}</b> are now recognized by the Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission. That means you''re legit. \
  You''re on the books. And from here on out, how your name spreads depends on whether you live up to it - or die \
  trying.</p>\
  <p>You''ll have access to certified contracts, neutral mediation, and a handful of favors you''d rather not ask how \
  we got. But make no mistake: screw up a contract, leave a job unfinished, or burn a client, and you''ll find out \
  real fast what it means to be blacklisted. We don''t do second chances. We do results.</p>\
  <p>Don''t try to impress us. Just do the work, keep your word, and keep your people alive. Everything else will \
  follow.</p>\
  <p>Welcome to the business, {22}. You''re in now. Try not to make us regret it.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.MBA=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p><b>{18}</b> are now formally recognized by the Clan Sea Fox Mercenary Bonding Authority. Your unit''s \
  designation, verification codes, and authorization ledger have been logged in accordance with market protocols. You\
  \ are now eligible for contract distribution, merchant-liaison support, and limited access to Clan-grade logistical\
  \ services - as merit and performance dictate.</p>\
  <p>Understand: this is not charity, and it is not indulgence. It is investment. We do not offer opportunity without\
  \ expectation. Clan Sea Fox rewards precision, discipline, and results. Inconsistent performance will reduce your \
  value. Failure to deliver will result in termination of bond, privilege, and future viability within our \
  contracting networks.</p>\
  <p>You are not just a mercenary. You are a commodity in motion. Prove your worth in the field, and the free market \
  will reward you accordingly. Underperform, and your ledger will close - permanently.</p>\
  <p>Conduct your operations with efficiency. Engage contracts with clarity. And remember: all things have price, but\
  \ not all things have value.</p>
FactionJudgmentDialog.message.WELCOME.HELLO.PIR=<h2 style="text-align:center;">Stop Right There, Criminal Scum!</h2>\
  <p>As pirates, you will be granted special raid contracts. All the rewards from these contracts will be yours for \
  the taking.</p>\
  <p>If <b>Faction Standings</b> is enabled, your success will be tracked by a special faction: the <b>Piracy Success \
  Index</b>. Be careful, perform poorly, and the law might catch up to you...</p>
