## From Parent
comingOfAge.message.0.fromParent.ic={8}, I just wanted to share some personal news - today, my child {2} turns <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s a big moment for {6} and for me as well. I still remember when {5} {0, choice, 0#were|1#was} just a kid, constantly tagging along\
  \ during downtime, asking questions about ''Meks and how they worked. Now {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} growing into a thoughtful, determined\
  \ young {3}, and it''s honestly a little overwhelming to see how far {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} come.</p>\
  <p>Raising a kid while on duty here isn''t easy, but {2}''s always shown a remarkable ability to adapt.</p>\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} taken on more responsibilities at home without being asked, and I''ve caught {6} offering to help out around\
  \ the hangar, even if it''s just fetching tools. It''s good to see that sense of duty taking root.</p>\
  <p>I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge how proud I am of {6}. Sometimes it''s easy to get lost in the grind,\
  \ but today, I''m reminded of why we keep pushing forward.</p>\
  <p>Thank you for understanding.</p>
comingOfAge.message.1.fromParent.ic={8}, well, it''s official - {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and I think {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already outgrown me both physically\
  \ and in attitude.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been walking around like {5} owns the place, and I swear {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been eyeing the cockpit of the ''Meks like it''s\
  \ {7} next project.</p>\
  <p>{5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} a good kid, though - doesn''t take shortcuts, and {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got that stubborn streak that probably comes from me.\
  \ Just yesterday, {5} {0, choice, 0#were|1#was} helping me organize some old maintenance logs and managed to find a mistake I''d missed. I''ll\
  \ never hear the end of it, but I''m proud of {6}.</p>\
  <p>Anyway, I figured you''d get a kick out of knowing that our newest "adult" is already planning how to take\
  \ over. I''ll keep {6} grounded... as much as I can.</p>
comingOfAge.message.2.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and it''s hitting me harder than I expected.\
  <p>Raising {6} out here has been challenging, but it''s also been a privilege. Seeing {6} grow up, learn to navigate\
  \ this life, and still keep {7} spirit intact - it''s not something I take for granted.</p>\
  <p>There have been days when I worried about the kind of life I''m giving {6} - always on the move, surrounded by\
  \ conflict. But seeing the way {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} turned out, I know {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} stronger for it. {4}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} resilient, sharp, and starting to\
  \ understand what it means to support the people around {6}.</p>\
  <p>I just wanted to share this moment. Sometimes, in the middle of everything, it''s good to remember that there''s more\
  \ to life than just surviving.</p>
comingOfAge.message.3.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} hit <b>16</b> today, and to be honest, it caught me off guard.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been helping out more lately - whether it''s cleaning up around the barracks or trying to fix that old comms \
  unit {5} found. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got this curiosity about how things work, and sometimes I catch {6} tinkering with spare parts.</p>\
  <p>It''s not easy balancing this life with being a parent, but {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been handling it better than I could have asked for.\
  \ Sometimes I wonder if {5} even realizes how proud I am of {6}.</p>\
  <p>I guess I just wanted to share that {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} growing into a pretty capable young {3}, and it''s a bit surreal to see.</p>\
  <p>Thanks for giving me the moment to reflect.</p>
comingOfAge.message.4.fromParent.ic={8}, today marked a special moment - {2} turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s hard to put into words how proud I am. Despite everything - the deployments, the unpredictability - {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown\
  \ into someone I can genuinely look up to. It''s funny how your own kid can surprise you like that.</p>\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been talking a lot about the future lately. {4}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} curious, driven, and already thinking about how {5} can make a\
  \ difference. I can see {6} wanting to follow in our footsteps, and while that thought''s a little daunting, it also\
  \ makes me feel like I''ve done something right.</p>\
  <p>Just wanted to share a bit of good news. We don''t get enough of that these days.</p>
comingOfAge.message.5.fromParent.ic={8}, today marks a big day for me - {2} turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s hard to believe how quickly time has passed. Feels like just yesterday {5} {0, choice, 0#were|1#was} that little kid running around\
  \ the hangar, wide-eyed at the sight of a ''Mek powering up. Now {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} taller, stronger, and asking tougher questions\
  \ about life and duty.</p>\
  <p>I can''t help but feel a bit emotional. Raising {6} out here hasn''t been easy, but seeing {6} grow into someone\
  \ thoughtful and resilient makes me proud. It''s moments like this that remind me why I keep pushing forward.</p>\
  <p>Thanks for allowing me a moment to reflect.</p>
comingOfAge.message.6.fromParent.ic={8}, I don''t know how it happened, but {2} turned <b>16</b> today.\
  <p>{5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} taller than me now and never misses a chance to point it out. Spends half {7} time trying to outdo me at\
  \ everything from lifting crates to fixing that old power coupler.</p>\
  <p>{5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} a good kid - got {7} heart in the right place and a stubborn streak a mile wide. Sometimes I wonder where {5}\
  \ gets it from.</p>\
  <p>Just wanted to share a little bit of good news. Kids grow up too fast, don''t they?</p>
comingOfAge.message.7.fromParent.ic={8}, today''s one of those rare days when I feel truly grateful.\
  <p>{2} turned <b>16</b>, and despite everything life''s thrown at us, {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown into someone I respect and admire. Sometimes\
  \ I catch myself wondering how I got so lucky.</p>\
  <p>Raising a kid while on duty isn''t easy, but {2}''s adapted better than I ever could''ve imagined. {4}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} curious about\
  \ everything - always asking questions and trying to help out. I''m proud of the person {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} becoming.</p>\
  <p>Just wanted to share that bit of happiness.</p>
comingOfAge.message.8.fromParent.ic={8}, somehow, {2} made it to <b>16</b> without giving me too many gray hairs.\
  <p>Though {5} has hit that age where {5} thinks {5} knows better than me, especially when it comes to maintenance work. I\
  \ caught {6} trying to "improve" the diagnostic system on one of the ''Meks. Didn''t go as planned, but at least {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got\
  \ ambition.</p>\
  <p>Thought you''d get a kick out of hearing that my own personal Astech is still in training.</p>
comingOfAge.message.9.fromParent.ic={8}, I just wanted to take a moment to share that Today {2} turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s a milestone that I can''t help but feel grateful for. Watching {6} grow up while juggling duty has been a\
  \ challenge, but {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} never complained. {4} just keeps going - learning, helping, and figuring things out.</p>\
  <p>{5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} growing into a fine young {3}, and I couldn''t be prouder. Thank you for supporting families like mine while\
  \ we''re out here. It means more than you know.</p>
comingOfAge.message.10.fromParent.ic={8}, I''d like to file a formal complaint - {2} just turned <b>16</b>, and I wasn''t consulted about how\
  \ fast time was allowed to fly.\
  <p>{5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} now taller than me, smarter than me (at least in {7} own mind), and has developed an affinity for arguing about\
  \ engine specs.</p>\
  <p>I''m pretty sure {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} plotting to take over my duties next. At least {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} putting that stubbornness to good use.</p>\
  <p>Just wanted to share the news - mostly because I could use some backup keeping {7} ego in check.</p>
comingOfAge.message.11.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>. It''s a big moment for {6} and for me as well.\
  <p>Despite the challenges we face out here, {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown into someone I can genuinely admire. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} taken to helping\
  \ out, always asking how things work and wanting to pitch in.</p>\
  <p>Seeing {6} take on new challenges without hesitation gives me hope. Sometimes, in the chaos of duty, we forget that\
  \ we''re also building something worth protecting. {2} reminds me of that.</p>
comingOfAge.message.12.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and it''s got me thinking about how much {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown.\
  <p>Life out here hasn''t always been easy for {6} - missing friends, moving between bases - but {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} taken it in stride.\
  \ {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} learned to make the most of it, even finding ways to help out where {5} can.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes I wonder if {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} had to grow up faster than {5} should. I just hope I''m giving {6} enough of a childhood\
  \ in between the responsibilities.</p>\
  <p>Figured I''d take a moment to share - can''t always keep the personal stuff bottled up.</p>
comingOfAge.message.13.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and it got me thinking about how fast life moves when you''re on duty.\
  <p>I''ve done my best to raise {6} right, but sometimes I wonder if I''m doing enough. Seeing {6} today - confident,\
  \ curious, and ready to tackle new challenges - I realized {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} become {7} own person, and that''s something to be\
  \ proud of.</p>\
  <p>It''s a good reminder that even when life feels like an endless grind, there''s growth happening in the quiet\
  \ moments.</p>
comingOfAge.message.14.fromParent.ic={8}, today''s a special one - {2} just turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been helping out around more than ever, trying to learn from anyone who''s willing to teach {6}. I ca\
  n see the drive in {6} to make a difference, and it''s honestly inspiring.</p>\
  <p>Raising {6} while balancing duty hasn''t always been easy, but seeing the young {3} {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} becoming makes it all worth\
  \ it. Just wanted to share this bit of good news - feels good to acknowledge it out loud.</p>
comingOfAge.message.15.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and it''s got me reminiscing.\
  <p>I still remember when {5}''d sit by the hangar door, fascinated by every ''Mek that passed by. Back then, {5}''d ask\
  \ endless questions about how the machines worked, and I''d do my best to explain without laughing at {7} wild\
  \ theories.</p>\
  <p>Now {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} talking about engineering like it''s second nature. It''s hard to believe how much {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown - not just\
  \ physically but in the way {5} thinks and approaches problems. I''m proud of {6}, even if {5} sometimes acts like\
  \ {5} knows more than I do.</p>
comingOfAge.message.16.fromParent.ic={8}, well, it''s official - {2} hit <b>16</b> today, and I''m pretty sure {5} grew another inch overnight\
  \ just to rub it in.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been giving me grief about how {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} taller now, as if that somehow means {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} in charge. I told {6} being tall\
  \ doesn''t make you any better at cleaning up the gear room, and {5} just rolled {7} eyes.</p>\
  <p>Thought you''d appreciate knowing that at least one of us is still growing.</p>
comingOfAge.message.17.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>. It''s an important moment for {6}, and I couldn''t be prouder.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} taken on more responsibilities lately - whether it''s helping organize supplies or learning basic maintenance.\
  \ {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a good heart and a willingness to help wherever {5} can.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes I wonder how {5} stays so grounded in the middle of all this, but I''m grateful for it. Just wanted to take\
  \ a moment to acknowledge how far {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} come.</p>
comingOfAge.message.18.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} hit <b>16</b>, and I can''t help but feel a sense of pride.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been showing more interest in how things work around here - fixing minor issues, lending a hand where {5} can.\
  \ I see that same spark of curiosity in {6} that first got me into this line of work.</p>\
  <p>It''s moments like these that remind me why we''re fighting - to give our kids a future where they can keep growing,\
  \ keep learning, and make something of themselves. {2}''s already well on {7} way.</p>
comingOfAge.message.19.fromParent.ic={8}, just thought I''d let you know - {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and I''ve officially lost the height\
  \ race.<p>\
  {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} taller, louder, and more convinced than ever that {5} knows better than me about almost everything. The latest\
  \ debate was about which coolant system works best on the heavier ''Meks.</p>\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got that typical teenage confidence, but at least {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} putting {7} energy into learning. I''ll call it a win as\
  \ long as {5} doesn''t start trying to pilot without permission. Again.</p>
comingOfAge.message.20.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and it got me thinking about how much things have changed since {5} {0, choice, 0#were|1#was}\
  \ a kid.\
  <p>Watching {6} grow up in the midst of all this - it makes you pause and wonder what kind of world we''re shaping for\
  \ the next generation.</p>\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a good head on {7} shoulders, despite the chaos around {6}. It''s humbling to see {6} developing {7} own\
  \ sense of purpose, even when the future feels uncertain. Sometimes, it''s the little milestones that give you hope.</p>
comingOfAge.message.21.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and I couldn''t be prouder.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been stepping up more lately - offering to help with maintenance, asking more questions about duty and\
  \ responsibility. It''s good to see that kind of initiative, and it reminds me that maybe we''re raising the next\
  \ generation right.</p>\
  <p>It''s not easy balancing duty with parenthood, but {2} makes it worthwhile. Just wanted to share the good news.</p>
comingOfAge.message.22.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and I''m half convinced {5} thinks it means {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} in charge now.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been asking to shadow the tech crew more often, claiming {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} "old enough to learn the real stuff." I caught\
  \ {6} practicing maintenance drills with the older guys, and {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got that look like {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} ready to take on the world.</p>\
  <p>It''s good seeing {6} push {6}self. I''ll let {6} enjoy {7} newfound "authority" for a day or two before reminding\
  \ {6} who''s still got the rank.</p>
comingOfAge.message.23.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} hit <b>16</b>, and it''s been making me think about how fast {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown up.\
  <p>Sometimes I worry about how this life has shaped {6} - always on the move, surrounded by conflict. But {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} handled\
  \ it better than I could''ve expected. {4}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} resilient, adaptable, and never loses that spark of curiosity.</p>\
  <p>I''m proud of the person {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} becoming, even if it feels like I blinked and missed half of it. Just thought I''d take\
  \ a moment to share.</p>
comingOfAge.message.24.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and I took a second to just watch {6} tinker with that busted-up cooling\
  \ unit.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown into a pretty capable young {3}, and it''s not often I get a chance to really appreciate it.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes I get caught up in worrying about how much {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} missed out on, but then I see {6} solving problems on {7}\
  \ own, and it gives me hope.</p>\
  <p>I guess seeing {6} turn <b>16</b> made me realize that despite everything, {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} doing alright. Just wanted to share that.</p>
comingOfAge.message.25.fromParent.ic={8}, I just wanted to share that today my child {2} turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s one of those moments where I can''t help but feel a little overwhelmed.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes I look at {6} and see that same kid who used to follow me around, wide-eyed and full of questions. Now,\
  \ {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} taller than me and eager to prove {6}self, whether it''s fixing equipment or learning from the tech crew.</p>\
  <p>I just wanted to take a moment to share a bit of good news. Thanks for your continued support.</p>
comingOfAge.message.26.fromParent.ic={8}, just wanted to give you a heads-up - {2} hit <b>16</b> today, and I swear {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} convinced it makes\
  \ {6} my equal now.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been strutting around like {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} in charge, trying to outdo me in everything from wrenching on the cooling units\
  \ to arguing about the best way to maintain the gyro systems.</p>\
  <p>It''s hard not to laugh at how serious {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} taking it. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got the enthusiasm, that''s for sure. I guess I''ll let\
  \ {6} think {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} winning for a little while longer.</p>\
  <p>Just thought you''d appreciate the update on our "Junior MekTech."</p>
comingOfAge.message.27.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s been one of those days where I can''t help but feel grateful. Despite everything we''ve been through, {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} growing\
  \ into a responsible, curious young {3}. Sometimes I catch {6} helping the maintenance crew without even being asked\
  \ - just because {5} wants to learn.</p>\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been asking a lot about what it means to serve and why we do what we do. I can see {6} trying to figure out\
  \ {7} place in all this, and it''s honestly impressive. Watching {6} grow up in the middle of this life isn''t easy, but\
  \ it''s moments like these that remind me why we fight to make things better.</p>
comingOfAge.message.28.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and it''s a bit surreal to think about how quickly time has passed.\
  <p>One minute {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} that little kid helping sort bolts in the ''Mek bay, and now {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} giving advice on how to better\
  \ secure the coolant lines. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got that mix of confidence and curiosity that keeps me on my toes.</p>\
  <p>It''s not all smooth sailing, though. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} hit that age where {5} challenges just about everything I say. Part of me\
  \ is proud to see {6} thinking for {6}self, but it also means a few more debates than I bargained for. Still, I wouldn''t\
  \ trade it for anything.</p>\
  <p>Figured I''d share this little milestone - feels good to see {6} becoming {7} own person.</p>
comingOfAge.message.29.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} turned <b>16</b> today, and it hit me harder than I expected.\
  <p>It''s one of those moments where I had to stop and really think about how much {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} grown. Raising {6} while being\
  \ in the line of fire hasn''t been easy.</p>\
  <p>There were days I worried about {6} feeling isolated or growing up too fast. But seeing {6} today - tall, confident,\
  \ and talking about {7} plans for the future - I couldn''t help but feel proud.</p>\
  <p>{5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} not just surviving out here; {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} thriving. {4}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} curious, motivated, and quick to lend a hand.</p>\
  <p>I know it''s just a birthday, but it feels like a milestone for both of us.</p>
comingOfAge.message.30.fromParent.ic={8}, {2} hit <b>16</b> today, and to be honest, it''s a bit of a reality check.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} gotten taller, stronger, and way more opinionated, and {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been asking a lot of tough questions lately - about\

  \ {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} seen.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes I worry that {5}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} had to grow up too fast, but I guess that''s just part of life out here. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got a good\
  \ head on {7} shoulders, and {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} not afraid to speak {7} mind. I''m proud of {6} for that, even if it means a few more\
  \ late-night talks than I bargained for.</p>
comingOfAge.message.31.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and I''ve been thinking a lot about {7} future.\
  <p>{4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been more involved in our duties these days, helping wherever {5} can and soaking up knowledge like a sponge. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got\

  <p>It''s good to see {6} wanting to be part of something bigger. Sometimes I forget just how resilient {5} is. {4}''{0, choice, 0#ve|1#s} been\

comingOfAge.message.32.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>.\
  <p>It''s been a long journey raising {6} while balancing duty, but seeing the young {3} {5}''{0, choice, 0#re|1#s} becoming makes me feel like\

  <p>I know not everyone gets to watch their kids grow up out here, and I don''t take it for granted. Sometimes I feel\

  <p>Just wanted to share this moment - it''s one of the good ones.</p>
comingOfAge.message.33.fromParent.ic={8}, today {2} turned <b>16</b>, and I can''t help but feel a mix of pride and amazement.\
