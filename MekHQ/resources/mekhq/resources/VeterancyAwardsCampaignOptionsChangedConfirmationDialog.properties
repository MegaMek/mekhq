VeterancyAwards.description=<h1 style="text-align:center">Veterancy Awards</h1>\
  You have just enabled <b>Veterancy Awards</b> in a campaign that previously had it disabled. Veterancy Awards \
  represent unique talents or flaws that emerge naturally as the character grows. They are not always positive, and \
  they are not always directly relevant to the character's professions. They are, however, free and create \
  interesting narrative opportunities. Such as the tech that develops Natural Aptitude/Gunnery or the MekWarrior who \
  turns out to be a bit of a Slow Learner after too many knocks on the head.\
  <p>Would you like to update all personnel to account for missed awards? If you confirm this action, any character \
  who has a Veteran rank (or better) will be granted a Veterancy Award. Normally characters recruited at Veteran \
  rank, or better, are ineligible for veterancy awards. This restriction will be waived in this instance.</p>\
  <p>{0}<b>Warning</b>{1}: This process {0}<b>cannot be reversed</b>{1}. Not all Veterancy Awards are positive. Each \
  character has a <b>1-in-40</b> chance of getting a Flaw. Some Flaws are <b>career ending</b>.
