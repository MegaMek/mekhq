ADVANCED_SCOUTING.title=Advanced Scouting
ADVANCED_SCOUTING.definition=If 'Advanced Scouting' is enabled in Campaign Options, characters will use their Scouting \
  Skills when exploring the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a> in \
  <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>.\
  <p>The hex a <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS'>Combat Team</a> is deployed to will always be revealed (unless the \
  force is deploying to a scenario. For all other hexes in range, the hex will only be revealed if the force passes a\
  \ scouting check. Normally scouting range is 0. However, it is increased by 1 for combat teams assigned to the \
  'Patrol' <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_ROLES'>Combat Role</a>. It can also be increased by certain \
  <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON_FACILITIES'>Facilities</a>.</p>\
  <p>The scouting check is made by each unit in the combat team, using the best scouting skill owned by a crewmember \
  in their unit. So if one crewmember has scouting 3+ and another 5+, the combat team will use the 3+ scouting \
  skill.</p>\
  <p>A character's scouting skill is their best skill from the following list:</p>\
  <p>- Communications (monitoring enemy communications)\
  <br>- Perception (spotting hostile activity)\
  <br>- Sensor Operations (performing sensor sweeps)\
  <br>- Stealth (scouting ahead)\
  <br>- Tracking (spotting signs of previous enemy movements)</p>\
  <p>Each unit has a modifier to the target number of their scouting check based on the weight of the unit. This \
  represents the ability for more nimble units to more easily cover ground and perform better at reconnisance \
  operations.</p>\
  <p>- &lt;= 35 tons: -2 modifier\
  <br>- &lt;= 55 tons: 0 modifier\
  <br>- &lt;= 75 tons: +2 modifier\
  <br>- &lt;= 100 tons: +4 modifier\
  <br>- >100 tons: +6 modifier</p>\
  <p>A unit's walk speed is also taken into account when calculating the target number:</p>\
  <p>- 1-3: +1 modifier\
  <br>- 4-7: 0 modifier\
  <br>- 8+: -1 modifier</p>\
  <p>If the unit has any jump capacity, the unit's speed is increased by 1, unless the unit is Jump Infantry. In \
  which case the unit's jump speed is used instead of its walk speed. If the unit is Aerospace, or an aerodyne \
  DropShip, their walk speed is doubled.</p>\
  <p>The target number is further reduced by 1 if the unit is equipped with either Improved Sensors or an Active \
  Probe.</p>\
  <p><b>Warning:</b> if a patrol fails to scout any adjacent hexes, and a scenario is spawned, that scenario will \
  spawn in the same hex as the patrol.</p>
AGING.title=Aging
AGING.definition=As your character grows older, their skills change. Tasks that were once easy become harder. Based on\
 \ the aging rules from <i>A Time of War</i>, characters gradually suffer the effects of aging as your campaign\
 \ progresses.\
 <p><b>Aging Milestones</b></p>\
 <p>There are ten aging milestones. When a character reaches a milestone, they suffer that milestone's effects along\
 \ with all the effects from previous milestones. For example, a 35-year-old character will suffer the penalties from\
 \ both the 25-year and 31-year milestones.</p>\
 <p><b>Skill Modifiers</b><p>\
 <p>Each skill is linked to one or two <a href='GLOSSARY:LINKED_ATTRIBUTES'>Linked Attributes</a>. Every aging milestone\
 \ adjusts skills depending on these attributes. For each eligible milestone, combine the modifiers from the skill's linked\
 \ attributes. If a skill has two linked attributes, add their modifiers together and halve the result.</p>\
 <p>For instance, a 44-year-old character increases Strength-based skills by +1 (from two +0.5 gains at 25 and 31).\
 \ Meanwhile, a 73-year-old would suffer a -1 penalty to the same skills, combining the attribute losses at each\
 \ milestone.</p>\
 <p><b>Clan Reputation</b></p>\
 <p>In Clan campaigns, aging imposes penalties on the character's Reputation <a href='GLOSSARY:ATOW_TRAITS'>Trait</a>.\
 \ Getting a Bloodname or reaching a high rank will reduce (or remove) this penalty.</p>\
 <p><b>Glass Jaw & Slow Learner</b></p>\
 <p>At certain aging milestones, characters are going to be inflicted with the Slow Learner and/or Glass Jaw SPAs. This\
  \ may be mitigated by taking the Fast Learner or Toughness SPAs. However, this will only be a temporary fix.\
 <p>For more details on Aging, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Aging Effects.pdf</i></p>
AREA_OF_OPERATIONS.title=Area of Operations
AREA_OF_OPERATIONS.definition=In <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>, the Area of Operations doesn't represent\
  \ the entire planet. Instead, it includes a collection of Sectors assigned to your unit. These Sectors contain\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES'>objectives</a>, scenarios, and sometimes special\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON_FACILITIES'>Facilities</a>.
ATB.title=Digital GM: Legacy Against the Bot
ATB.definition=Against the Bot (AtB) is one of the oldest systems in MekHQ, serving as an early attempt at creating a\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a>.\
 <p>In late 2024, Legacy AtB was officially succeeded by <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> and is now considered\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:DEPRECATED'>Deprecated</a>.
ATOW_TRAITS.title=A Time of War Traits
ATOW_TRAITS.definition=In <i>A Time of War</i> many of what we call 'SPAs' are actually 'Traits.' However, because of \
  the way MeKHQ implemented SPAs it made sense to have these as SPAs, not Traits. However, There are some Traits \
  that were not implemented as SPAs, but as Traits (Connections, Wealth, Reputation, Unlucky, and\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:EDGE'>Edge</a>).</p>\
  <p>The rules for each may be found in <i>A Time of War</i> except for Unlucky and Edge, which are handled differently\
  \ in MekHQ (see the linked Glossary entry).
ATTRIBUTE_SCORES.title=Attribute Scores
ATTRIBUTE_SCORES.definition=In <i>A Time of War</i> There are seven Attribute Scores: Strength (STR), Body (BDY),\
 \ Reflexes (RFL), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Willpower (WIL), and Edge (EDG). Each skill is assigned 1-2 of\
 \ these Attributes as its <a href='GLOSSARY:LINKED_ATTRIBUTES'>Linked Attributes</a>, which influence the skill's final\
 \ Target Number. <a href='GLOSSARY:EDGE'>Edge</a> is handled differently in MekHQ and has its own Glossary entry.\
  <p>A character's starting Attribute Scores are dependent on their starting Profession. For more details on starting\
  \ attribute scores, refer to the documentation in\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Starting Attribute Scores.pdf</i></p>
AUTOINFIRMARY.title=AutoInfirmary
AUTOINFIRMARY.definition=AutoInfirmary lets you instantly assign all injured personnel to qualified doctors with\
 \ just a single click.\
 <p>When pressing the 'Optimize Assignments' button, AutoInfirmary will assign the most critically injured personnel to\
 \ your most qualified doctors. It will then work its way down the list until you are out of\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:HOSPITAL_BEDS'>Hospital Beds</a> or everyone is assigned to a doctor.</p>\
 <p>The most injured <a href='GLOSSARY:PRISONERS_OF_WAR'>Prisoner of War</a> is going to be prioritized <i>after</i> the\
  \ least injured non-prisoner. So no need to worry about prisoners taking beds away from your personnel.</p>\
 <p>In MekHQ Options, there's a setting to automatically run AutoInfirmary on each new day, meaning you never need to\
 \ manually assign doctors. If you find yourself without enough hospital beds, MekHQ will warn you with a daily alert\
 \ (unless that alert has been disabled in MekHQ Options).</p>
### B
BLOODMARK.title=Bloodmark
BLOODMARK.definition=Bloodmarks are a type of <a href='GLOSSARY:ATOW_TRAITS'>Trait</a>. The higher a character's \
  'Bloodmark', the greater the chance a 'Bloodhunt' occurs. When this happens, a bounty hunter will make an attempt on \
  the character's life. This may result in them escaping, getting injured, or even being killed.\
  <p>On the first of each month a check is made to see whether one or more Bloodhunts are scheduled. This is based on\
  \ the character's Bloodmark level. Purchasing the 'Alternative ID' SPA halves the chance of a Bloodhunt occurring.</p>\
  <p>- <b>Bloodmark 1:</b> 1-in-6 (1-in-12 with Alternative ID)\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 2:</b> 1-in-3 (1-in-6 with Alternative ID)\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 3-5:</b> automatic (1-in-2 with Alternative ID)</p>\
  <p>If Bloodhunts are scheduled, a follow-up check is made to determine how many attempts will be made on the \
  character's life. The first scheduled attempt occurs in d6 days, with subsequent attempts occurring every d6 days \
  after that. The Bloodhunt schedule is not player-visible.</p>\
  <p>- <b>Bloodmark 1:</b> d6/3 attempts (rounded down)\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 2:</b> d6/2 attempts (rounded down)\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 3:</b> d6/3 attempts (rounded down)\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 4:</b> d6/2 attempts (rounded down)\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 5:</b> d6 attempts\
  <p>When a Bloodhunt occurs, there is a 1-in-n chance that the assassination attempt will be successful. This is \
  based on the level of their Bloodmark Trait.</p>\
  <p>- <b>Bloodmark 1-2:</b> 1-in-20\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 3-4:</b> 1-in-10\
  <br>- <b>Bloodmark 5:</b> 1-in-5</p>\
  <p>If a Bloodhunt is successful, the character is dealt d6 <i>Hits</i> and the check is made again. This process is\
  \ repeated until the character is either killed or the Bloodhunt is unsuccessful.</p>\
  <p>Additional information about the Bloodmark Trait can be found in the 'Bloodmark' section of <b>A Time of War</b>.</p>
### C
CAPITAL_SYSTEMS.title=Capital Systems
CAPITAL_SYSTEMS.definition=On the interstellar map, a faction's capital system is marked by a special ring. Each faction\
 \ will only have a single capital. Navigating there will increase the likelihood of receiving contracts for that faction.
CHANGING_FILTERS_HANGAR.title=Changing Filters in the Hangar Tab
CHANGING_FILTERS_HANGAR.definition=Sometimes you want to change the amount or type of information displayed in the\
 \ Hangar Tab.\
 <p>To do this, click on the dropdown titled 'Unit Type' at the top of the tab. That will allow you to display only the\
 \ units you're interested in.</p>\
 <p>Similarly, the 'View' dropdown lets you change what kind of information is available for each unit.</p>
CHANGING_FILTERS_PERSONNEL.title=Changing Filters in the Personnel Tab
CHANGING_FILTERS_PERSONNEL.definition=Sometimes you want to change the amount or type of information displayed in the\
 \ Personnel Tab.\
 <p>To do this, click on the dropdown titled 'Personnel Type' at the top of the tab. That will allow you to display only\
 \ the professions you're interested in.</p>\
 <p>Similarly, the 'View' dropdown lets you change what kind of information is available for each character.</p>
CHANGING_FILTERS_WAREHOUSE.title=Changing Filters in the Warehouse Tab
CHANGING_FILTERS_WAREHOUSE.definition=Sometimes you want to change the amount or type of information displayed in the\
 \ Warehouse Tab.\
 <p>To do this, click on the dropdown titled 'Part Type' at the top of the tab. That will allow you to display only\
 \ the parts you're interested in.</p>\
 <p>Similarly, the 'Part Status' dropdown lets you further filter what parts are displayed.</p>
COMBAT_ROLES.title=Combat Roles
COMBAT_ROLES.definition=Combat Roles are used in <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> to declare what kind of\
 \ strategic actions a force is taking. Campaigns not using StratCon can still declare Combat Roles, but they will not\
 \ have any game effects.\
 <p>There are seven Combat Roles in total, each with a distinct purpose:</p>\
 <p>- <b>Frontline:</b> This Combat Role lets you <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deploy</a> defensive minefields\
 \ prior to the first turn in a scenario. how many minefields you can place is dependent on the <i>Tactics</i> skill\
 \ of the drop commander (usually the leader of the first force to deploy to the scnario). If you don't want to deploy\
 \ Minefields, you can instead use tactics to deploy Conventional Infantry units.\
 <br>- <b>Maneuver:</b> This Combat Role lets you more easily <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_REINFORCE'>reinforce</a>\
 \ scenarios. When reinforcing with a force assigned to this role, you roll the reinforcement check twice, using only\
 \ the best result. This makes reinforcements far more reliable.\
 <br>- <b>Training:</b> Training forces allow senior personnel to train the next generation. There's a lot to this\
 \ combat role, and you are advised to read the documentation cited at the bottom of this Glossary entry. One important\
 \ point to mention, a Training force <b>must</b> use the <a href='GLOSSARY:REMAIN_DEPLOYED'>Remain Deployed</a> option\
 \ when deployed to the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations (AO)</a>, otherwise no training will\
 \ take place.\
 <br>- <b>Patrol:</b> Forces assigned to this role are deployed to scout the AO. Normally, when a force deploys to the\
 \ AO, they remove the fog of war surrounding the hex they deploy to. Forces assigned to this role reveal not only that\
 \ hex but also all adjacent hexes (note: enabling <a href='GLOSSARY:ADVANCED_SCOUTING'>Advanced Scouting</a> changes\
  \ these rules) Furthermore, when a force deploys to the AO, There''s a chance they will be immediately pulled into \
  a hidden scenario. When a Patrol deploys, any hidden scenarios will always be one hex away unless the force is \
  deploying ''blind'' (deploying to an unscouted hex).\
 <br>- <b>Cadre:</b> Training forces represent your personnel being assigned to train local forces. Outside of Cadre \
  Duty contracts this is a roleplay only role. Cadre Duty contracts will require some of your forces to be assigned \
  to this role, limiting your combat options.\
 <br>- <b>Auxiliary:</b> Forces assigned to this role are those you intend to pull into scenarios piecemeal. While\
 \ Auxiliary forces may be used to reinforce, they are best used to house Conventional Infantry for tactics deployment.\
 \ Or units specialized in being brought into a scenario as <a href='GLOSSARY:LEADERSHIP_UNITS'>Leadership Units</a>.\
 \ MekHQ will generally ignore Auxilliary forces when picking a <a href='GLOSSARY:SEED_FORCES'>Seed Force</a>.\
 <br>- <b>Reserve:</b> Reserve forces are forces that are not deployed to the combat theater. They might be too battered\
 \ to fight, or simply being held in reserve. Like Auxiliary forces, MekHQ will generally ignore reserve forces when\
 \ picking a Seed Force.</p>\
 <p>For more details on Combat Roles, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/StratCon/Combat Teams, Roles, Training & Reinforcements.pdf</i></p>
COMBAT_TEAMS.title=Combat Teams
COMBAT_TEAMS.definition=Combat Teams are cohesive groups of forces designed to fight together. A Combat Team could be a\
 \ single Lance, Star, or another regional variant, or it could be a larger group like a Company made up of several\
 \ Lances and their support units.\
 <p>A key feature of Combat Teams is player control: you decide exactly which forces should be assigned to scenarios.\
 \ By default, any force without child forces and containing at least one unit is automatically considered a Combat\
 \ Team. However, you can adjust this default by right-clicking on a force and selecting 'Never Consider a Combat\
 \ Team,' or 'Always Consider a Combat Team.' To remove any overrides, use the same right-click menu and select\
 \ "Remove Combat Team Override."</p>\
 <p>In your <a href='GLOSSARY:TOE'>TO&E</a> a Combat Team is indicated by the name of the force being <b>bold</b>. If\
 \ you override the default Combat Team selection, the force is going to be underlined. This lets you see which\
 \ forces you adjusted in the event you need to update your TO&E.</p>\
 <p><b>EXAMPLE</b></p>\
 <p>If you have a Company of three Lances, MekHQ would normally treat each Lance as an individual Combat Team. But if\
 \ you want the entire Company to <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deploy</a> as one Combat Team, you can override the\
 \ default setting by right-clicking on the company-level force and selecting 'Always Consider a Combat Team.' This\
 \ is particularly useful for large campaigns where deploying in Lance-level formations results in implausibly large\
 \ numbers of scenarios each week.</p>\
 <p><b>FORCE TYPE</b></p>\
 <p>There are four kinds of force classification: <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT'>Combat</a>,\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_CONVOY'>Convoy</a>, <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_SECURITY'>Security</a>, \
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_SUPPORT'>Support</a>, and<a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_SALVAGE'>Salvage</a>. Each is \
  set up for a specific duty. A force's type may be changed by right-clicking on the force and selecting the type of \
  your choice.</p>\
 <p>For more details on Combat Teams, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/StratCon/Combat Teams, Roles, Training & Reinforcements.pdf</i></p>
COMPLETE_MISSION_GUIDANCE.title=Complete Mission Guidance
COMPLETE_MISSION_GUIDANCE.definition=When you select 'Complete Mission,' you are going to be asked whether the\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:MISSIONS_AND_CONTRACTS'>Mission or Contract</a> was a success, partial success, failure, or contract\
 \ breach. While the final decision is up to you and your chosen narrative, here is some guidance for\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> enabled campaigns.\
 <p>- <b>Success</b>: if all <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES'>Strategic Objectives</a> were completed successfully,\
 \ then the contract should be recorded as a success.\
 <br>- <b>Partial Success</b>: if by the conclusion of the contract, any Strategic Objectives were failed, the contract\
 \ should only count as a Partial Success.\
 <br>- <b>Failure</b>: if all Strategic Objectives were failed, the contract is a failure.\
 <br>- <b>Contract Breach</b>: if you're ending the contract early but haven't completed all Strategic Objectives, it\
 \ should count as a Contract Breach. Avoid doing this where possible.</p>
CONNECTIONS.title=Connections
CONNECTIONS.definition=Connections are a type of <a href='GLOSSARY:ATOW_TRAITS'>Trait</a> that applies multiple \
  benefits if the character is the campaign commander.\
  <h2>Force Reputation</h2>\
  <p>The unit's <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_REPUTATION'>Force Reputation</a> is increased by however many points the \
  commander has in Connections.</p>\
  <h2>Monthly Checks</h2>\
  <p>If monthly Connections rolls are enabled in Campaign Options, each month the commander will make roll 2d6, on \
  4+ the commander's contacts will donate funds to the campaign.</p>\
  <p>The amount of funds donated is based on the character's Connections score:</p>\
  <p>- <b>1:</b> 1,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>2:</b> 2,500 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>3:</b> 5,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>4:</b> 10,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>5:</b> 25,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>6:</b> 50,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>7:</b> 100,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>8:</b> 250,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>9:</b> 500,000 C-Bills\
  <br>- <b>10:</b> 1,000,000 C-Bills</p>\
  <p>Furthermore, if both monthly rolls and the new Personnel Market are enabled, each month the commander will make \
  roll 2d6. On a 4+ the commander's contacts will hook them up with additional recruits in the personnel market. \
  This will increase the chance of seeing rare personnel, such as Elite characters or characters with unusual \
  professions.</p>\
  <p>The number of recruits added to the market is based on the character's Connections score:</p>\
  <p>- <b>1:</b> 0 recruits\
  <br>- <b>2:</b> 0 recruits\
  <br>- <b>3:</b> 0 recruits\
  <br>- <b>4:</b> 1 recruits\
  <br>- <b>5:</b> 2 recruits\
  <br>- <b>6:</b> 3 recruits\
  <br>- <b>7:</b> 4 recruits\
  <br>- <b>8:</b> 6 recruits\
  <br>- <b>9:</b> 7 recruits\
  <br>- <b>10:</b> 10 recruits</p>\
  <p>Finally, each month a check is made to determine if the character loses contact with their Connections. If the \
  character loses contact, they temporarily lose all levels in Connections for d6 months. This could reflect \
  something happening to the character's contact, the contact just not being available, or the contact not being \
  willing to extend support to the campaign.</p>\
  <p>The chance of losing access to a character's contacts is based on the character's Connections score:</p>\
  <p>- <b>1:</b> 7 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>2:</b> 7 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>3:</b> 6 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>4:</b> 6 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>5:</b> 5 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>6:</b> 5 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>7:</b> 4 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>8:</b> 4 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>9:</b> 3 or less on 2d6\
  <br>- <b>10:</b> 3 or less on 2d6</p>
CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS.title=Contract Victory Points
CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS.definition=Contract Victory Points (CVP) represent an abstract measure of your contract's overall\
  \ strategic success. Most contracts require a positive CVP to be considered\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:COMPLETE_MISSION_GUIDANCE'>successful</a>.\
  <p>Even if all other <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES'>objectives</a> are met, having a neutral or negative CVP\
  \ will result in a failure or, at best, a Partial Success.</p>\
 <p>CVP should not be confused with <a href='GLOSSARY:SCENARIO_VICTORY_POINTS'>Scenario Victory Points (SVP)</a>.
CREW_REQUIREMENTS.title=Crew Requirements
CREW_REQUIREMENTS.definition=All units in MekHQ need to be fully crewed before they may be used. The full rules for crew\
 \ requirements may be found in the <i>Tech Manual</i>.\
 <p>However, if you just need to know how many gunners you need for any specific unit, switch the 'View'\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:CHANGING_FILTERS_HANGAR'>filter</a> to 'Status.'</p>\
 <p>You can then hover over the Crew entry for each unit to get a handy tooltip that breaks down the unit is crew\
 \ requirements.</p>\
 <p>This is particularly useful for Large Vessels that can sometimes require hundreds of personnel.</p>
CRISIS_SCENARIO.title=Crisis Scenarios
CRISIS_SCENARIO.definition=<b>Crisis</b> are special scenarios that require your immediate attention. They represent\
  \ important moments that can define the strategic stability of a contract.\
 \ <p>A crisis might consist of important supply convoys coming under enemy fire. Where failing to\
 \ rout the OpFor will result in them being able to linger behind your lines, causing significant\
 \ strategic damage.</p>\
  <p>Alternatively, a crisis might feature the enemy trying to rescue important prisoners, the successful extraction of\
  \ which would give them valuable intel.</p>\
 \ <p>No matter the strategic context, the rules are simple: failing to win a Crisis will result in the loss of 1\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS'>Contract Victory Point (CVP)</a>, similar to losing a\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:TURNING_POINT'>Turning Point</a> scenario. However, unlike Turning Points, winning a Crisis will\
  \ <b>not</b> award CVP. Furthermore, Crisis scenarios will <i>still</i> deduct 1 CVP even if the scenario is a Draw.</p>
### D
DAMAGED_PARTS.title=Damaged Parts
DAMAGED_PARTS.definition=Sometimes you will notice damaged parts in your warehouse. These usually come from\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRIPPING_AND_REPAIRING'>stripping</a> salvaged units.\
 <p>To repair a part, select it in the warehouse, select a tech followed by 'Do Task.'</p>\
 <p>Alternatively, you can right-click on the part and select '<a href='GLOSSARY:MASS_REPAIR_MASS_SALVAGE'>Mass Repair</a>'.\
 \ This will allow you to quickly repair all damaged parts. Though for more important parts, you are usually better off\
 \ micromanaging assignment to ensure the job is done properly.</p>
DELIVERY_TIMES.title=Delivery Times
DELIVERY_TIMES.definition=In a universe as large as the Inner Sphere, where JumpShips are a precious rarity, acquiring\
 \ replacement parts and units isn't a quick process.\
 <p>Keep in mind that unlike what we're used to, as consumers, 'next day delivery' doesn't exist at the strategic level\
  \ in Battletech. JumpShip Captains are not hanging about waiting for your order. Instead, your order is placed via HPG\
  request, processed, and then a DropShip and JumpShip are sourced to deliver it. Generally, these ships will only set\
  \ forth once their holds are full enough to warrant the journey.</p>\
 <p>All this means that, in most cases, you will notice yourself waiting months for a replacement part or unit to arrive.\
 \ We strongly recommend spending 2-3 months between each contract rearming, repairing, and restocking. Failing to do\
 \ this will leave you high and dry when you need parts the most.</p>\
 <p>The rules for delivery times can be found in <i>Campaign Operations</i>.</p>
DEPRECATED.title=Deprecated
DEPRECATED.definition=A deprecated system or option is no longer actively developed or supported.\
 \ <p>While these systems remain available, they will eventually be removed.</p>
DIGITAL_GM.title=Digital GM
DIGITAL_GM.definition=In MekHQ, a Digital GM refers to any system designed to replace a human GM in campaign play.\
 <p>Currently, There are two Digital GMs available: <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> and\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:ATB'>Legacy Against the Bot</a> (<a href='GLOSSARY:DEPRECATED'>deprecated</a>)</p>
### E
EDGE.title=Edge
EDGE.definition=In certain circumstances, Edge may be used to reroll negative events. Like failing a skill check, or\
 \ suffering a head hit in combat. Because of legacy decisions, Edge doesn't follow the rules outlined in <i>A Time of\
  \ War</i>. In MekHQ 'Edge' is considered a '<a href='GLOSSARY:ATOW_TRAITS'>Trait</a>.'\
 <p>To change when Edge triggers, right-click on a character in the Personnel Tab and navigate to Edge Triggers.</p>\
 <p>Each point in the 'Unlucky' Trait reduces available Edge by 1.</p>
EDUCATION.title=Education
EDUCATION.definition=The Education Module empowers you to enroll your personnel in various educational programs, be it\
 \ mastering Mek Repair intricacies or undergoing military boot camp training. It aims to simulate the educational\
 \ systems of the Inner Sphere and beyond.\
 <p>There are three types of 'academy':</p>\
 <p>- <b>Prestigious Academies</b> are canonical academies found in the Battletech setting. The information for these\
 \ academies is based on canon sources and required extensive research. Find something we got wrong or an academy we\
 \ missed? Let us know (but ensure you cite your sources)!\
 <br>- <b>Local Academies</b> are education institutions that may be assumed to exist but are not explicitly mentioned\
  \ in canon sources. Things like the no-name local military academy or high school.\
 <br>- <b>In-Unit Education</b> is the catch-all label for any education that may be reasonably performed in-house\
 \ (rather than sending the students off for a formal education). Generally in-unit education is inferior to formal\
 \ education, but hey, it is free!</p>\
 <p>Think the education takes too long? The duration of academy courses is actually slightly shorter than their\
 \ canonical counterparts (as we condense the academy year, removing breaks). It turns out that training the next\
 \ generation of MekWarriors takes a long time!</p>\

EMPTY_SYSTEMS.title=Empty Systems
EMPTY_SYSTEMS.definition=Empty or abandoned systems are only visible if the 'Empty Systems' option is enabled in the blue\
 \ display panel. These are systems that have no population and are generally avoided by JumpShip Captains. Becoming\
 \ stranded in one of these systems could be disastrous.\
 <p>Currently, MekHQ doesn't model the dangers of traversing empty systems. However, that will not always be the case\
 \ and players are advised to avoid these systems when possible.</p>
EXPERIENCE_COSTS.title=Experience Costs
EXPERIENCE_COSTS.definition=Both the New and Veteran Player presets model their xp costs on <i>A Time of War</i>. These\
  \ costs can be higher than expected if you've played MeKHQ for a long time.\
  <p>In older versions, xp costs were based on <i>Total Warfare</i>, and where Total Warefare was missing information\
  \ (such as for most <a href='GLOSSARY:SKILL_TYPES'>Support Skills</a>), developers came up with their own costs.</p>\
  <p>The costs in <i>Total Warfare</i> are not well suited to MekHQ, as they are designed for very short-lived, in-person\
  \ campaigns. Campaigns where you might fight only a handful of scenarios across the entire campaign. Meanwhile, in\
  \ MekHQ, personnel are expected to fight dozens of scenarios every year.</p>\
  <p>Around 50.03 we made the decision to move to <i>A Time of War</i> for most personnel management. Personnel already\
  \ existed at the scale of <i>A Time of War</i> so this made a lot of sense. The increased XP costs also were a good\
  \ fit for MekHQ as they significantly slowed down player progression. Something that has been a problem for a long\
  \ time. As can be attested to by anyone who's taken an Admin character from Green to Elite in a single garrison contract.</p>\
  <p><b>The Higher Costs Don't Fit My Campaign</b></p>\
  <p>Maybe you prefer the pace of quicker progression, or maybe you don't have time to play and still want to feel like\
  \ you're progressing. Maybe you want progress to be even slower? No matter your reason for changing the XP scale, MekHQ\
  \ has you covered. Head to Campaign Options, Advancement/Awards & Randomization/Experience Awards. There you will see\
  \ an option titled 'Advancement Multiplier.' This is a multiplier applied to <i>all</i> xp costs across MekHQ.</p>\
  <p>Some common picks include:</p>\
  <p>- <b>1.25</b>: all costs are increased by 25%\
  <br>- <b>0.75</b>: all costs are decreased by 25%\
  <br>- <b>0.5</b>: all costs are decreased by 50% (the default for the New Player Preset)\
  <br>- <b>0.25</b>: all costs are decreased by 75%</p>\
  <p>Experiment to find the scale that works for you.</p>
EXPERIENCE_RATING.title=Experience Rating
EXPERIENCE_RATING.definition=Experience Rating is a measure of your campaign's veterancy. MekHQ uses the rules found in\
 \ <b>Campaign Operations</b> to determine this value.\
 <p>Some important things to note:</p>\
 <p>- If your skill milestones (Green, Veteran, etc) differ to those used in Campaign Operations, experience rating\
 \ might not be exactly what you expect. This is because Campaign Operations uses a specific calculation to determine\
 \ experience rating and <b>not</b> the experience level of personnel. By default, both the New Player and Veteran Player\
 \ presets base their skills on <b>A Time of War</b> and not <b>Campaign Operations</b>.\
 <br>- Only combat personnel assigned to <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT'>Combat Forces</a> in your\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT'>TO&A</a> are factored into this calculation.\
 <br>- Some older MekHQ systems were built around <a href='GLOSSARY:ATB'>Legacy AtB</a>. Legacy AtB used the now outdated\
 \ <b>Field Manual: Mercenaries, revised</b> Unit Rating system. It is impossible to translate\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:ATB'>Force Reputation</a> into Unit Rating. Therefore, where Unit Rating needs to be used, we use your\
 \ Experience Rating instead. As this is the most comparable metric available.</p>
EXTRA_INCOME.title=Extra Income
EXTRA_INCOME.definition=Extra Income is a type of <a href='GLOSSARY:ATOW_TRAITS'>Trait</a> that rewards the character\
  \ with additional funds each month. Positive Extra Income means the character gains money, monthly. Negative Extra \
  Income acts as a monthly debit from the character's account.\
  <p>If the character is the designated <b>Campaign Commander</b> then these extra funds are used to modify the \
  campaign finances. Either as a credit (if the Trait is positive) or a debit (if the Trait is negative).</p>\
  <p>If the character is <b>not</b> the designated <b>Campaign Commander</b> then the funds are used to modify their \
  <b>Total Earnings</b> (if total earnings tracking is enabled in <b>Campaign Options</b>). Otherwise, Extra Income \
  has no effect.</p>\
  <p>If the character is a child, they are only affected by their Extra Income Trait if they are also the designated \
  campaign commander.</p>\
  <p>The exact funds gained each month can be found in <b>A Time of War</b>, in the section headed 'Extra Income.' \
  If you have the 'Better Extra Income' campaign option enabled, these values are multiplied by 100.</p>
### F
FATIGUE.title=Fatigue
FATIGUE.definition=Fatigue measures how exhausted a character is from their experiences. It is typically accumulated\
  \ through exploring the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a> in <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>,\
  \ sustaining injuries (if this is enabled in Campaign Options), and participating in scenarios.\
 <p>High fatigue can affect performance in scenarios (if TacOps Fatigue is enabled in MegaMek Options) and can also\
  \ affect a character's likelihood of resigning.</p>\
 <p>The core rules for Reputation may be found in Campaign Operations, with additional rules available in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module (feat. Fatigue).pdf</i></p>
FIELD_CONTROL.title=Field Control Explanation
FIELD_CONTROL.definition=At the end of a <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> scenario, you are going to be asked\
  \ whether you retain control of the field. This determines whether you are able to salvage the field and recover any\
  \ lost units or crew. Each scenario has field control predetermined depending on the strategic context of that scenario.\
 <p>While it might be tempting to always declare field control whenever you kill all enemies on the field, you are\
 \ strongly discouraged from doing so. Just because you have killed all immediate threats, it doesn't mean You haven't\
 \ other hostile forces waiting off-screen. In StratCon, the strategic manuevuring of forces and battlelines is abstracted,\
 \ so the greater narrative context of the scenario needs to be taken into consideration.</p>\
 <p>Alternatively, if you would prefer a game design justification: MekHQ's economics is fragile and easily broken by\
 \ an endless flow of salvage.</p>
FIELD_KITCHENS.title=Field Kitchens
FIELD_KITCHENS.definition=Field Kitchens are a special type of equipment found on some vehicles, usually Support Vehicles.\
 \ The effects of Field Kitchens may be found in the <a href='GLOSSARY:FATIGUE'>Fatigue</a> section of <b>Campaign\
 \ Operations</b>. Unlike Campaign Operations, you are not required to assign Field Kitchens to specific forces in your\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:TOE'>TO&E</a> (for now).\
 <p>However, the Field Kitchen-equipped unit must meet these criteria:</p>\
 <p>- It needs to be fully crewed. Most Field Kitchen-equipped units are Support Vehicles, which means they need additional\
 \ crew beyond just drivers and gunners. You can check what <a href='GLOSSARY:CREW_REQUIREMENTS'>crew</a> you are missing\
  \ in the Hangar tab.\
 <br>- It needs to be fully repaired. No serving burgers out of a busted-up van.\
 <br>- It needs to be placed in your TO&E. Ideally, you will want to assign the force you place it in as a\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_SUPPORT'>Support Force</a>. This tells MekHQ that the force isn't a\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT'>Combat Force</a>.</p>\
 <p>Sometimes you may need to advance to the next day for MekHQ to recognize your Field Kitchen-equipped unit.</p>
FORCE_REPUTATION.title=Force Reputation
FORCE_REPUTATION.definition=Reputation reflects how well-known your unit is and whether others trust your\
 \ ability to complete missions.\
 <p>Detailed rules on Reputation may be found in <i>Campaign Operations.</i></p>
FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT.title=Combat Forces
FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT.definition=This is the default force type.\
 <p>A combat force is one meant for general combat and is the only type of <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS'>Combat Team</a>\
 \ that is considered when determining contract pay.</p>\
 <p>If you have a <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a> enabled, forces marked as Combat Forces may be drawn\
 \ into scenarios. ensure you reassign any forces you don't want fighting.</p>
FORCE_TYPE_CONVOY.title=Convoy Forces
FORCE_TYPE_CONVOY.definition=These forces perform logistical support generally behind the front lines. Running supplies\
 \ and making sure front line forces are kept stocked up.\
 <p>If <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> is enabled, while on contract, you can use Convoy Forces during monthly\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:RESUPPLY'>Resupplies</a>. However, be careful when building your resupply convoys. You should avoid\
 \ having a force totaling more than 200t as this increases the chance the enemy will intercept your convoy.</p>
FORCE_TYPE_SECURITY.title=Security Forces
FORCE_TYPE_SECURITY.definition=Forces assigned to Security duties are primarily responsible for managing\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:PRISONERS_OF_WAR'>Prisoner Capacity</a>. If the <i>Campaign Operations</i> or <i>MekHQ</i> capture\
  \ styles are enabled in campaign options, units assigned to Security Forces will contribute to the campaign's\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:PRISONER_CAPACITY'>Prisoner Capacity</a>.
FORCE_TYPE_SUPPORT.title=Support Forces
FORCE_TYPE_SUPPORT.definition=A Support Force is any force not typically <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deployed</a>\
 \ in combat scenarios. This classification is ideal for units like support vehicles, civilians, or other forces that\
 \ belong in the <a href='GLOSSARY:TOE'>TO&E</a> but aren't meant to fight.\
 <p>If <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> is enabled, Support Forces are rarely used as a \
  <a href='GLOSSARY:SEED_FORCES'>Seed Force</a>, aking them a useful classification for logistical or non-combat \
  units.</p>\
 <p>You should consider placing any DropShips and JumpShips into Support Forces unless you have enough Aerospace assets\
 \ to protect them. This represents you keeping these valuable vessels away from the fighting rather than risking them\
 \ close to hostile territory.</p>
FORCE_TYPE_SALVAGE.title=Salvage Forces
FORCE_TYPE_SALVAGE.definition=A Salvage Force is any force not typically <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deployed</a>\
 \ in combat scenarios. Instead, they are assigned to scenarios during the deployment stage and perform salvage \
  operations once it has concluded.\
  <p>For an idea of what makes a good salvage force, check the Salvage rules in <i>Campaign Operations</i>.</p>
### G
GROUP_BY_UNIT.title=Group by Unit
GROUP_BY_UNIT.definition=Group by Unit is an option in the Personnel Tab that can reduce how many personnel are visible\
 \ at any given time. This option hides all crews of multi-personnel units <i>except</i> the unit commander. Deselect\
 \ the option to show them again.
### H
HOSPITAL_BEDS.title=Hospital Beds & MASH Theatres
HOSPITAL_BEDS.definition=Hospital Beds reflect the maximum number of injured personnel that may be tended to at any\
 \ given time. By default, this is 25 patients per Doctor. However, that may be changed in Campaign Options.\
 <p>In Campaign Options, There's an option for Doctors to use the <i>Administration</i> skill. If enabled, the number\
 \ of beds each Doctor can support is adjusted depending on their <i>Administration</i> skill. No <i>Administration</i>\
 \ skill means the Doctor can support only 10 beds. With Ultra-Green allowing them to support 15 beds, 20 for Green, 25\
 \ for Regular, 30 for Veteran, and 35 for Elite+.</p>\
  <p>Also, in Campaign Options, there is an option to enable <i>MASH Theatre Tracking</i>. If enabled, your maximum \
  number of concurrent patients is limited by the number of MASH Theatre-equipped units you have in your TO&E. To \
  count, these units must be fully crewed and cannot be damaged. By default, the number of patients supported by a \
  single MASH Theatre is 25. However, that may be changed in Campaign Options.</p>\
  <p>If you have both <i>MASH Theatre Tracking</i> and <i>Administration</i> enabled, the total number of beds \
  supported is equal to the total bed capacity across all doctors <b>or</b> the capacity provided by the MASH \
  Theatres. Whichever is smaller.</p>
HOW_TO_DEPLOY.title=How to Deploy to a Scenario
HOW_TO_DEPLOY.definition=Deploying to a scenario is different depending on whether it is a\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> scenario or not (StratCon scenarios are any scenario that appears in the\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a> Tab).\
 <p>- <b>StratCon Scenario:</b> navigate to the AO and right-click on the chosen scenario (ensure you're on the\
 \ right Sector). Select 'Manage Deployment' and pick the force you would like to deploy. Only forces assigned to\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_ROLES'>Combat Roles</a> may be deployed in this manner.\
 <br>- <b>Non-StratCon Scenario:</b> head to your <a href='GLOSSARY:TOE'>TO&E</a> and right-click on the force you\
 \ would like to deploy. In the right-click menu, There's going to be an option to deploy the force, select that followed\
  \ by the scenario you wish to deploy to.</p>
HOW_TO_REINFORCE.title=How to Reinforce a Scenario
HOW_TO_REINFORCE.definition=Sometimes you will find yourself in a situation where you are outgunned and need to call for\
 \ reinforcements.\
 <p>To reinforce a scenario, right-click on the scenario in the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations\
 \ (AO)</a> and select 'Manage Reinforcements.' This will allow you to pick what force to reinforce with.</p>\
 <p>Reinforcing a scenario costs 1 <a href='GLOSSARY:SUPPORT_POINTS'>Support Point</a>, although this may be increased\
 \ to reduce the Target Number of the reinforcement check. Failing a reinforcement check can cause the reinforcements\
 \ to arrive late or sometimes even intercepted.</p>\
 <p>For more details on reinforcing scenarios, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/StratCon/Combat Teams, Roles, Training & Reinforcements.pdf</i></p>
HR_STRAIN.title=HR Strain
HR_STRAIN.definition=HR Strain reflects the extra paperwork and management effort needed for larger\
 \ campaigns. Your campaign''s <b>HR Capacity</b> comes from adding up the <i>Administration</i> skill of\
 \ all personnel with the <i>Admin/HR</i> role, multiplied by the value set in the <i>HR Capacity</i>\
 \ campaign option (<b>Default:</b> 10). Even low-skilled <i>Admin/HR</i> staff help keep things running smoothly.\
 <p><b>HR STRAIN</b></p>\
 <p>Each person typically adds 1 point of HR Strain unless noted below.</p>\
 <p><b>Civilians:</b> For civilians (those with <i>Dependent</i> or <i>None</i> as their primary role), divide the total\
 \ by 10 (rounded normally).\
 <p><b>AsTechs and Medics:</b> Characters with only the AsTech or Medic role don''t add to HR Strain since\
 \ their team leader is expected to manage them.\
 <p><b>TURNOVER PENALTY</b></p>\
 <p>The penalty to the <a href='GLOSSARY:TURNOVER'>Turnover</a> target number from HR Strain is equal to\
 \ total <i>HR Strain</i> divided by total <i>HR Capacity</i>. There''s no cap to this penalty, so it can quickly \
  spiral out of control.</p>\
 <p>There are no benefits to having extra <i>HR Capacity</i>.</p>\
 <p>For more details on HR Strain, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module.pdf</i></p>
### I
INFANTRY_GUNNERY_SKILLS.title=Infantry Gunnery Skills
INFANTRY_GUNNERY_SKILLS.definition=While MekHQ does not model the exact skills required to use individual infantry \
  weapons, we allow players to simulate that, should they wish.\
  <p>For Conventional Infantry skill calculations, each soldier will use their best skill from the following list:</p>\
  <p>- Archery\
  <br>- Demolitions\
  <br>- Martial Arts\
  <br>- Melee Weapons\
  <br>- Small Arms\
  <br>- Support Weapons\
  <br>- Thrown Weapons</p>\
  <p>Admittedly, this does allow you to create rifle-armed platoons, where snipers use the power of Kung-Fu to \
  defeat their enemies. Whether you want to pick more suitable skills for those soldiers is left to your discretion.</p>
### J
JUMP_COST_CALCULATIONS.title=Jump Cost Calculations
JUMP_COST_CALCULATIONS.definition=While traveling, you are generally required to pay to transport your units, cargo, \
  and personnel. This can be disabled in campaign options, but it is enabled by default in all stock presets.\
  <p>To calculate the cost of a jump, MekHQ first determines what can be transported by your existing assets. It \
  then uses the following process to verify the cost to transport any excess:</p>\
  <p><b>Step 1: Transporting Units</b></p>\
  <p>Excess units are broken into the following categories. This tells us how many bays of each type you need to \
  hire:</p>\
  <p>- Small Craft\
  <br>- 'Meks\
  <br>- Fighters (Aerospace or Conventional)\
  <br>- Super Heavy Vehicles\
  <br>- Heavy Vehicles\
  <br>- Light Vehicles\
  <br>- ProtoMeks\
  <br>- Infantry\
  <br>- Battle Armor\
  <br>- Other (priced as 'Meks)</p>\
  <p>We then use the abstract values listed on page 10 of <i>Campaign Operations</i> to determine the cost of each \
  bay. As MekHQ charges per day, rather than per week (or month), the CamOps values are divided appropriately.</p>\
  <p><b>Step 2: Transporting Passengers</b></p>\
  <p>With units calculated, we next tally up how many passengers need to be transported. Passengers are any personnel \
  that are traveling with the unit (including Camp Followers) that have not been assigned to a unit. Each passenger \
  bay can transport 15 passengers. This value was reached by dividing the number of passengers that can be \
  transported by a Princess Luxury Liner (the only canon passenger DropShip) by 14 (the number of bays in a Union \
  DropShip). Passenger bays are priced according to the cost for infantry platoons listed in CamOps.</p>\
  <p>To work out how many DropShips we need to hire to transport your units and passengers, we divide the total \
  number of required bays by 14. The number of bays in a standard Union DropShip.</p>\
  <p><b>Step 3: Transporting Cargo</b></p>\
  <p>Next, we total any excess cargo that needs to be transported (including mothballed units) and divide this value \
  by 1,874.5 (the cargo capacity of a cargo Union DropShip). This gives us the total number of cargo DropShips you \
  need to hire. Unlike the CamOps values for cargo transport, MekHQ charges by the ton. Therefore, the cargo values \
  shown in CamOps are divided by 1,200.</p>\
  <p><b>Step 4: Renting JumpShip Collars</b></p>\
  <p>The number of DropShips we need to hire dictates how many JumpShip collars need to be hired. The cost of hiring \
  a collar is listed in CamOps.</p>\
  <p><b>Step 5: Total Cost</b></p>\
  <p>Once all the costs have been calculated, we add them together to get the total cost of each day of transit.</p>

LEADERSHIP_UNITS.title=Leadership Units
LEADERSHIP_UNITS.definition=When <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deploying</a> to a scenario in <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>,\
 \ if the leader of the first force to deploy has ranks in the <i>Leadership</i> skill, they can deploy Leadership Units.\
 \ While There are no limits on what kinds of units may be drawn into a scenario in this manner, There's a BV limit.\
 \ Each level in <i>Leadership</i> (up to a maximum of 5) adds 500 BV to the budget.\
 <p>It is worth noting that when picking units, only their base BV is considered; therefore, it doesn't factor in\
 \ pilot skills.</p>
LINKED_ATTRIBUTES.title=Linked Attributes
LINKED_ATTRIBUTES.definition=In <i>A Time of War</i> each skill is assigned 1-2 'Linked Attributes.' These influence the\
 \ final Target Number of the skill.
LOYALTY.title=Loyalty
LOYALTY.definition=Loyalty measures how committed a character is to your cause. Characters with higher loyalty are less\
  \ likely to resign. Loyalty can fluctuate over time because of your decisions  and personal life events, like marriage\
  \ or having children.\
 <p>For more details on Loyalty and its effects, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module (feat. Fatigue).pdf</i></p>
### M
MAINTENANCE.title=Maintenance
MAINTENANCE.definition=If enabled in Campaign Options, all units will require maintenance. The exact rules for maintenance\
 \ may be found in Campaign Operations. Sometimes you may notice the days till the next maintenance cycle showing as a\
 \ decimal place. This is because maintenance requirements are lower on certain contracts (or when not on contract).
MANAGEMENT_SKILL.title=Management Skill
MANAGEMENT_SKILL.definition=Management Skill represents the individual leadership talents of personnel in the chain of\
 \ command. For each of these roles, a single person is selected as the commanding officer for that role:\
 \ Aerospace, Vehicle, Infantry, Naval, Tech, Medical, Administrator, MekWarrior.\
 <p>Commanding officers are determined by the highest-ranked member of each role group, using experience level (green,\
 \ regular, etc.) as a tiebreaker. That person's <i>Leadership</i> skill, plus the value set in the <i>Unskilled Penalty</i>\
 \ campaign option (<b>Default:</b> 0), is their Management Skill. This Management Skill is applied to the turnover\
 \ target numbers of all personnel covered by that role. If personnel have two roles, they use the mean value of the\
 \ management skills from the commanding officer of both roles.</p>\
 <p><b>EXAMPLE</b></p>\
 <p>MekWarrior Bill's commanding officer has a Management Skill of -1, increasing Bill's turnover\
 \ target number by 1. Aerospace Pilot Sally's commanding officer has a Management Skill of 3, reducing her turnover\
 \ target number by 3.</p>\
 <p>For more details on Management Skill and its effects, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module (feat. Fatigue).pdf</i></p>
MASS_REPAIR_MASS_SALVAGE.title=Automated Mass Repair, Mass Salvage
MASS_REPAIR_MASS_SALVAGE.definition=Mass Repair, Mass Salvage (MRMS) lets you automate the whole repair and salvage\
 \ process. You can click the Mass repair/salvage button in the Repair Bay, which will bring you to a menu where you can\
 \ customize the conditions in which mass repair will work. Most notably, at the bottom, you will notice a list of what types\
 \ of jobs may be automated, e.g., replacement of armor, repair of actuators, etc.\
 <p>Two of the most important options are Min TN and Max TN, which determine what tasks may be done automatically by your\
 \ techs.</p>\
 <p><b>Min TN</b> signifies the hardest task that is going to be run without your input. Essentially, it is the highest Target\
 \ Number a tech will attempt.</p>\
 <p><b>Max TN</b> doesn't currently work as intended (0.50.06), as it serves to determine if tech should apply\
 \ rush-job rules. We recommend setting Max TN to 12 for all options and turning off rush jobs checkmark for automation.\
 \ Improvements to MRMS are scheduled for 0.50.07.</p>\
 <p>If you save these settings as the default (using the button on the bottom of the window), the mass repair/salvage\
 \ will run daily, provided you have turned it on in MekHQ Options.</p>
MISSING_IN_ACTION.title=Missing in Action
MISSING_IN_ACTION.definition=Sometimes your personnel may go MIA. When this happens each day an automatic attempt will\
 \ be made to track them down. Any MIA characters are abandoned if you leave the planet they went missing on.\
 <p>For more details on Missing in Action characters, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Random Events/Prisoners of War & Abstracted Search and Rescue.pdf</i></p>
MISSING_LIMBS.title=Replacing Missing Limbs
MISSING_LIMBS.definition=If you have 'Advanced Medical' enabled in Campaign Options, your personnel will occasionally find\
 \ themselves separated from their arms and legs. Luckily for them, in 50.04 medical science developed prosthetic\
 \ limbs!\
 <p>Navigate to the injured character in the Personnel Tab and right-click on their entry in the roster. You will see\
 \ an option to replace missing limbs. Replacing limbs requires a small payment and either a qualified doctor\
 \ in your roster or for one to be found locally. You are unable to find local doctors if you are not planetside.</p>\
 <p>Once the surgery has been completed, there's going to be a short recovery period. During this period, the patient is\
 \ incapacitated and probably shouldn't be sent back into combat.</p>
MISSIONS_AND_CONTRACTS.title=Missions and Contracts
MISSIONS_AND_CONTRACTS.definition=MekHQ groups scenarios together under one of two categories: Missions and Contracts.\
 <p>- <b>Missions</b> are any group of loosely related scenarios. These are useful for when you just need to\
 \ spawn a few scenarios for your GM'd campaign.\
 <br>- <b>Contracts</b> represent formal agreements with employers to complete a goal or serve for a period of\
 \ time. If using a <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a> this is the category you are going to be interacting\
  \ with the most.
MORALE.title=Morale
MORALE.definition=MekHQ Morale system is only in use while a <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a> is enabled.\
 <p>This system reflects not only the mental state of opposing forces but also their ability to resist effectively.\
 \ Morale levels range from "routed" (very low) to "overwhelming" (very high), with several steps in between.\
 <p><b>MORALE CHECKS</b></p>\
 <p>At the start of each month, 2d6 is rolled to see if the enemy's morale changes. On a 5 or less, their morale\
 \ improves one step towards "routed." On a 9+ their morale drops one step towards "overwhelming."</p>\
 <p>There are several factors that modify this roll:</p>\
 <p><b>Reliability:</b> The higher rated the enemy force, the harder they are to rout.</p>\
  <p>The base reliability of an enemy force is determined by their quality: F (-1), D, C, B (+0), A, A* (+1). Clan\
  \ forces increase their quality by 1, up to a maximum of A*.</p>\
  <p>Next, we adjust for special faction considerations. If the enemy faction is Rebel, Mercenary, Pirate, or from\
  \ a Minor Faction, their reliability is reduced by 1. If the enemy faction is Clan, their reliability is increased \
  by 1. This means Clan forces two bonuses, by design.</p>\
 <p><b>Performance:</b> Performance plays an important part in determining whether the enemy force adjusts their \
  morale.</p>\
  <p>First, we total up all victories achieved over the prior month. Each normal Victory is worth 1 point, and each \
  Decisive victory is worth 2 points.</p>\
  <p>Then we total up all defeats suffered over the prior month. Each normal Defeat is worth 1 point, and each \
  Decisive Defeat is worth 2 points. If a scenario is marked as a 'Refused Engagement' it is considered to have been \
  a Decisive Defeat. If, instead, it is marked as a 'Fleet in Being' it is only counted as a normal Defeat. \
  Similarly, all Pyrrhic Victories are counted as normal Defeats.</p>\
  <p>If the number of victory points exceeds the number of defeat points you are considered to have scored a \
  Victory, over the past month. If victory points are at least double defeat points, you are considered to have \
  achieved a Decisive Victory.</p>\
  <p>Conversely, if the number of defeat points exceeds the number of victory points you are considered to have \
  suffered a Defeat. If defeat points are at least double victory points, you are considered to have suffered a \
  Decisive Defeat.</p>\
  <p>The exact modifiers applied to the morale roll for a Victory, Defeat, and so on are determined by Campaign \
  Options.</p>\
  <p><b>ROUTING THE ENEMY</b></p>\
 <p>When an enemy is routed, their forces are severely damaged and unable to offer effective resistance. Routed enemies\
 \ will not generate new scenarios. For any contract other than Garrison Duty, Cadre Duty, Security Duty, or Riot Duty,\
 \ all remaining <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES'>objectives</a> are considered completed, and the contract's\
  \ conclusion date is automatically moved to the next day.</p>\
 <p>For those contracts listed above (so-called 'garrison type contracts') the contract doesn't end early, but the\
 \ enemy forces are in full retreat. After the first month of peace, There's a 25% chance a new opposition will arrive;\
 \ otherwise the peace continues.

NAVIGATION_INTERSTELLAR_MAP.definition=The Interstellar Map has some really useful shortcuts that can help you chart\
 \ your way across the stars.\
 <p>- <b>Left Mouse Button Drag:</b> Hold down the left mouse button and drag to move the camera.\
 <br>- <b>Middle Mouse Button:</b> zoom in and out.\
 <br>- <b>Single Left Mouse Button:</b> this will select a system.\
 <br>- <b>Double Left Mouse Button:</b> this will select a system and jump to the solar system view, which allows you\
 \ to select specific planets.\
 <br>- <b>Alt/Option + Left Mouse Button:</b> this will calculate a jump path to the selected system.\
 <br>- <b>Shift + Left Mouse Button:</b> this will add a jump to the existing jump path. This is useful if you want to\
 \ make a detour on your way to your final destination, or manually plot a route.</p>\
  <p>If you want to manually path into an <a href='GLOSSARY:EMPTY_SYSTEMS'>empty system</a>, make sure you don't have\
  \ the checkbox to avoid empty systems ticked.</p>
NEW_PLAYER_GUIDE.title=The New & Returning Player Guide
NEW_PLAYER_GUIDE.definition=MekHQ is a complicated beast, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. If you're new to MekHQ, or\
 \ have missed a few Development releases (like when upgraded from one Milestone to the next), consider checking out\
 \ our <a href='DOCUMENTATION:NEW_PLAYER_GUIDE'>New Player Guide</a>. After all, "Information is Ammunition!"

PARTS_AVAILABILITY.title=Parts Availability
PARTS_AVAILABILITY.definition=If Parts Availability is enabled in Campaign Options, your procurement attempts are going\
  \ to be modified depending on your current contract. If you have multiple concurrent contracts, the contract with the\
  \ lowest availability is going to be used.\
 <p>Parts Availability serves to represent the difficulty of acquiring resources on certain contracts. It is also used\
 \ to reflect your ability to hook into your employer's supply network. This means that on some contracts parts are going\
  \ to be more readily available than on others.</p>\
 <p>The modifiers are as follows. Remember that these modifiers are applied to the Target Number of your procurement\
 \ checks, so higher is worse than low.</p>\
 <p>- Guerrilla Warfare: 2\
 <br>- Diversionary Raid, Objective Raid, Recon Raid, Extraction Raid: 1\
 <br>- Planetary Assault, Relief Duty: 0\
 <br>- Pirate Hunting: -1\
 <br>- All Others: -2</p>
PARTS_IN_USE.title=Parts in Use
PARTS_IN_USE.definition=This dialog shows all types of spare parts, mechanisms, weapons, armor, etc. used across your\
 \ campaign. This list also notes the amounts used. Sorting the list by the 'In Use' column will give you a good\
 \ impression of what parts are the most in demand. Normally, armor comes first, followed by heat sinks, gyros, and\
 \ weapons.\
 <p>Other columns tell you what surplus you already have, and how much it all weighs. 'Requested Stock Percentage' allows\
 \ you to set up <b>AutoLogistics</b>. When using AutoLogistics, your acquisitions personnel (usually Admin/Logistics\
 \ characters) will buy the percentage of surplus parts indicated here either by your order or weekly.</p>\
 <p>To order the corresponding stock, you can click 'order parts to fill requested stock' to immediately stock up on\
 \ needed items.</p>\
 <p>Alternatively, you can enable weekly restocking by checking the 'Add Part Orders to Fill the Requested Stocks Weekly'\
 \ box. Keeping all parts on stock is usually a good strategy for repairs but will bloat your warehouse and risks ruining\
 \ your early budget.</p>
PRISONER_CAPACITY.title=Prisoner Capacity
PRISONER_CAPACITY.definition=Prisoner Capacity measures how many prisoners your security personnel can effectively\
  \ manage without risking a crisis. Typically, each prisoner occupies one unit of capacity, though certain events may\
  \ alter this value.\
 <p>For more details on Prisoner Capacity and its management, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Random Events/Prisoners, Defection & Dependents.pdf</i></p>
PRISONERS_OF_WAR.title=Prisoners of War
PRISONERS_OF_WAR.definition=War is an unforgiving battleground, and in the chaos of combat, soldiers may find themselves\
 \ captured by the enemy. Prisoners of war (POWs) are an inevitable reality of any prolonged military campaign, and how\
 \ they are treated can shape the perception and reputation of the force that holds them.\
 <p>Prisoners may be spotted in the personnel roster by their special 'Prisoner' title. Some prisoners are willing to\
 \ defect, and these are marked with an astrisk next to 'Prisoner.'</p>\
 <p>Depending on your campaign options, you can have a vastly different prisoner experience. However, one thing is\
 \ <b>important</b> if you are using the MekHQ Capture Style, you are going to be invited to ransom prisoners during special\
 \ events. In prior versions, this could be done at any time. However, that is no longer the case.</p>\
 <p>For more details on Prisoners of War and their management, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Random Events/Prisoners, Defection & Dependents.pdf</i></p>
PROFESSIONS.title=Professions
PROFESSIONS.definition=Professions are the various jobs personnel can be assigned to. Each profession has a tooltip\
 \ which describes the profession, the skills required to take it, and the <a href='GLOSSARY:LINKED_ATTRIBUTES'>Linked\
 \ Attributes</a> for those skills. There are currently three types of profession available:\
 <p>- <b>Combat Professions</b> are those professions used to crew combat units. MekWarrior is an example of a Combat\
 \ Profession.\
 <br>- <b>Support Professions</b> are professions that have specific mechanics tied to the campaign layer. These\
 \ professions are generally not used in combat scenarios. An example of a Support Profession would be MekTech.\
 <br>- <b>Civilian Professions</b> are assigned to civilian personnel. They have no mechanical impact and are usually\
 \ used for roleplay or to represent professions held before joining the campaign. Prior to 0.50.07 Dependent is the only\
 \ Civilian Profession. However, 0.50.07 is going to be adding hundreds of new professions to help round out the civilians\
  \ in your campaign.</p>

RELEASE_TYPE_DEVELOPMENT.title=Development Releases
RELEASE_TYPE_DEVELOPMENT.definition=Development builds are the regular releases that come out frequently as part of the\
 \ ongoing development cycle. Every release starts as a Development build, containing the latest features, bug fixes,\
 \, and improvements. While they're generally stable, Development releases may occasionally have quirks, minor bugs, or\
  \ unexpected behavior.\
 \ <p>These builds are great if you want to stay current with the latest changes and don't mind occasionally encountering\
 \ small issues.</p>
RELEASE_TYPE_MILESTONE.title=Milestone Releases
RELEASE_TYPE_MILESTONE.definition=Milestone builds are the recommended choice for most players. These are\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:RELEASE_TYPE_DEVELOPMENT'>Development</a> releases that have proven themselves stable and reliable\
  \ after several weeks of real-world testing by the community.\
 \ <p>A Development release is designated a Milestones retroactively once it's demonstrated that it doesn't have major\
  \ bugs or weirdness.</p>\
 \ <p>You can expect a new Milestone roughly every 6-9 months, making them the perfect balance between stability and having\
 \ access to recent features and improvements.</p>
RELEASE_TYPE_NIGHTLY.title=Nightly Releases
RELEASE_TYPE_NIGHTLY.definition=Nightly builds are like experimental LosTech salvaged from Star League caches - powerful\
 \ but unpredictable. Assembled nightly (around 23:00 Eastern Time), they offer a glimpse of cutting-edge features at\
 \ the expense of stability. Much like an experimental RISC laser, they tend to go critical when you least expect it.\
 <p><b>Important:</b></p>\
 <p>The focus of Nightly builds is testing new features and upcoming changes. They are not recommended for general play\
 \ and should be avoided by new users. If you encounter a bug on a Nightly release, it is <b>essential</b> that you\
 \ report it immediately.</p>\
 <p>When playing on a Nightly release, ensure you keep frequent backups of your saves as permanent save corruption is\
  \ far more likely on a Nightly release.</p>
RELEASE_TYPES.title=Nightly, Development and Milestone Releases
RELEASE_TYPES.definition=MegaMek uses a three-stage release process. Every night a\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:RELEASE_TYPE_NIGHTLY'>Nightly</a> build is created. Every few months we release a\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:RELEASE_TYPE_DEVELOPMENT'>Development</a> build. Then, if that Development build proves stable, we\
 \ declare it a <a href='GLOSSARY:RELEASE_TYPE_MILESTONE'>Milestone</a>.\
 <p>You should always pick the type of release you're most comfortable with. If in doubt, pick the Milestone.</p>
RANDOM_PERSONALITIES.title=Random Personalities
RANDOM_PERSONALITIES.definition=Random personalities is a feature that assigns personnel with random personality\
 \ characteristics and quirks. At present, these characteristics are intended for flavor purposes. However, in\
 \ the future, we plan to integrate these characteristics into a Random Events module, where they will influence the\
 \ events personnel encounter. Random Personalities may be enabled (or disabled) in Campaign Options.\
 <p>At the time of writing, There are 2,353 unique individual personality trait descriptions split across Aggression,\
  \ Ambition, Greed, Social, Talent, and Quirks. Except for Talent and Quirks, each trait is considered either\
  \ positive or negative. Some traits are also noted to be 'major' traits. If enabled in Campaign Options, personality\
  \ traits can influence the 'Commander Rating' portion of <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_REPUTATION'>Force Reputation</a>.</p>\
 <p>Talent</b> is a special case, if enabled in Campaign Options, a character's Talent score can influence the XP \
  cost of skills, SPAs, and Edge purchases.\
 <p>Don't like the personality generated? In GM Mode you can right-click on any given character and regenerate their\
 \ personality via the right-click menu. Alternatively, you can enter Edit Person in the same menu and pick a personality\
 \ that best suits your character.</p>\
 <p>Want to use Random Personalities but don't want the personality descriptions appearing for certain characters?\
 \ Right-click on the character and head to 'Flags.' There you'll find an option that lets you hide the personality\
 \ of individual characters. Perfect for those main characters whose personality you want to write by hand.</p>
REMAIN_DEPLOYED.title=Remain Deployed
REMAIN_DEPLOYED.definition=Sometimes you might want to have a force Remain Deployed to the\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations (AO)</a> in <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>. To\
 \ do this, right-click on the destination hex to <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deploy</a> as normal. Once the force\
 \ has been deployed, right-click on the hex again and select 'Remain Deployed.' The force will now remain in place\
 \ until recalled (via the right-click menu).\
 <p>Two things are worth mentioning:\
 <p>- Forces assigned to the Training <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_ROLES'>Combat Role</a> must use this option otherwise\
 \ no training will take place.\
 <br>- When placing scenarios to represent enemy actions, StratCon will place a higher weight on\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON_FACILITIES'>Facilities</a> and forces using the 'Remain Deployed' option. This means that\
 \ you can use spare forces to act as a 'lightning rod' to lure enemy attacks away from your facilities.</p>
RELOADING_FIELD_GUNS.title=Reloading Infantry Field Guns
RELOADING_FIELD_GUNS.definition=Unlike other units, Conventional Infantry maintains their own equipment - including\
 \ reloading spent shots.\
 <p>If you have a repair task appear asking you to reload a field gun, select the task like you would normally, and then\
 \ attempt the task without selecting a tech. The Conventional Infantry unit will perform the task for you.</p>\
 <p>Be aware that as the unit is going to be performing the task, it needs to have performed no other tasks that day. Which\
 \ means you will likely be unable to reload field guns the day the unit returns from deployment.</p>
REPAIR_SITE.title=Repair Site
REPAIR_SITE.definition=When arriving at a contract destination (while using a <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a>)\
 \ your units are going to be automatically assigned to Repair Sites.\
 <p>This depends on the contract type as follows:</p>\
 <p>- <b>Guerrilla Warfare:</b> Improvised\
 <br>- <b>Diversionary Raid, Objective Raid, Recon Raid, Extraction Raid:</b> Field Workshop\
 <br>- <b>Garrison Duty, Cadre Duty, Security Duty, Riot Duty:</b> Maintenance Facility\
 <br>- <b>Other:</b> Basic Facility</p>\
 <p>If your <a href='GLOSSARY:EXPERIENCE_RATING'>Experience Rating</a> is Veteran, or higher, the facility level will\
 \ be increased by 1:</p>\
 <p>- Improvised becomes Field Workshop\
 <br>- Field Workshop becomes Basic Facility\
 <br>- Basic Facility becomes Maintenance Facility\
 <br>- Maintenance Facility becomes Factory Conditions</p>
REPAIRING_DAMAGED_HIP_SHOULDER.title=Repairing Damaged Hips or Shoulders
REPAIRING_DAMAGED_HIP_SHOULDER.definition=Sometimes a 'Mek unit may sustain a critical hit to the shoulder or hip. If\
  \ this happens, you must fully replace the relevant limb.\
 <p>To do this, first set the unit to <a href='GLOSSARY:STRIPPING_AND_REPAIRING'>Strip</a> and remove <b>all</b> parts\
 \ from that limb. This will allow you to scrap the limb before switching back to Repair mode and replacing\
 \ everything.</p>\
 <p>This whole process may be very time-consuming and delicate, so you may have to wait until the end of the\
 \ contract.</p>
RESUPPLY.title=Resupplies
RESUPPLY.definition=Monthly Resupplies are the primary way to receive supplies while on contract. At the beginning of\
 \ each month, your employer will offer to sell you surplus weapons, armor, and parts depending on the strategic situation.\
 \ When the situation is favorable, supplies are more plentiful and less expensive. During tough times, supplies are\
 \ scarcer and more expensive.\
 <p>In Guerilla Warfare contracts, Resupplies come from local smugglers instead of your employer. These supplies are\
 \ more expensive and less reliable. Smuggler deals carry the risk of scams, and offers may not appear every month.</p>\
 <p><b>CONTENTS</b></p>\
 <p>The contents of a Resupply depend on the combat units in your <a href='GLOSSARY:TOE'>TO&E</a> with an emphasis\
 \ on damaged or missing equipment. This is then compared against the items you have in your warehouse, with the\
 \ focus on items you're running low on. While Resupplies will not always contain exactly what you need, when you need\
 \ it, they will always provide items you can use.</p>\
 <p><b>PLAYER CONVOYS</b></p>\
 <p>Player Convoys offer a high-risk, high-reward option for securing larger Resupplies. Designating a force as a\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS'>Convoy</a> increases the size of your Resupply by 400%, but at the cost of exposure\
 \ to interception. If the Convoy is intercepted, you'll need to fight off enemy forces to protect your supplies. Losing\
 \ a Convoy can result in the permanent loss of all assigned units and personnel.</p>\
 <p>NPC Convoys are a safer but smaller alternative. If an NPC Convoy is intercepted, you'll lose the supplies but not\
 \ any personnel or units.</p>\
 <p>Convoy size influences interception risk. Larger convoys are more detectable and easier to target. For the best\
 \ results, aim for around 200t. The enemy having high <a href='GLOSSARY:MORALE'>Morale</a> also increases the chance a\
  \ convoy is intercepted. If a convoy is intercepted, you can send a <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS'>Combat Team</a> to\
  \ defend it.</p>\
 <p>For more details on Resupplies, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/StratCon/Resupply & Convoys.pdf</i></p>
### S
SCENARIO_VICTORY_POINTS.title=Scenario Victory Points
SCENARIO_VICTORY_POINTS.definition=Scenario Victory Points (SVP) determine the outcome of an individual scenario. A\
  \ negative SVP results in a Defeat. A neutral SVP leads to a Draw. A positive SVP counts as a Victory.\
 <p>Keep in mind that many scenarios offer multiple paths to victory - you don't need to complete every objective to\
  \ succeed.</p>\
 <p>SVP should not be confused with <a href='GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS'>Contract Victory Points (CVP)</a>.</p>
SEED_FORCES.title=Seed Forces
SEED_FORCES.definition=When <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> generates a scenario, it will pick a Seed Force. This\
 \ can be any <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_COMBAT'>Combat Force</a> in your <a href='GLOSSARY:TOE'>TO&E</a>. The BV of\
 \ that Combat Force serves to balance the scenario. Forces assigned to the Auxillary or Reserve\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_ROLES'>Combat Roles</a> will only be picked if There are no other suitable forces - for\
 \ example if they're the only force not already assigned to scenarios. Or if you forget to assign forces to Combat Roles.\
 <p>If a scenario is generated when the force <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deploys</a> 'blind' into a hex covered by\
  \ fog  of war, or for a <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES'>Strategic Objective</a> scenario, then that force is\
  \ going to be used as the seed force rather than a random one.</p>\
 <p>Normally, There's no need to know which of your forces has been selected as a Seed Force. But if it becomes relevant\
 \ for roleplay or bug tracking purposes, note that it will always be shown in the MekHQ.log file. However, you should\
 \ look for it immediately when the scenario appears in your Briefing Room tab. Otherwise, it will either be buried or\
 \ lost when MekHQ is restarted. Look for a line containing the phrase, <i>Forced BV contribution</i>.</p>
SKILL_TYPES.title=Skill Types
SKILL_TYPES.definition=Skills are broken up into four types: Combat, Support, Utility, and Roleplay. Each skill has a\
 \ tooltip which explains the skill and its <a href='GLOSSARY:LINKED_ATTRIBUTES'>Linked Attributes</a>.\
 <p>- <b>Combat</b> skills are those that are directly used in combat scenarios. They include things like gunnery and\
 \ piloting.\
 <br>- <b>Support</b> skills are those used at the campaign level and are not used in combat. These are things like\
 \ <i>Administration</i> and the various tech skills.\
 <br>- <b>Roleplay</b> skills exist just for roleplay purposes and are not mechanically implemented. This includes\
 \ things like the various Art skills.\
 <br>- <b>Utility</b> skills are not currently implemented, but they are Roleplay skills that have been mechanically\
 \ implemented in some limited manner.</p>
STRATCON.title=Digital GM: StratCon
STRATCON.definition=Introduced in 2021, StratCon officially replaced <a href='GLOSSARY:ATB'>Against the Bot</a> as the\
  \ premier <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a> in 2024.\
 <p>StratCon allows you to engage in battles across an entire <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a>,\
  \ tackle challenging scenarios, collecting salvage, and completing <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES'>strategic\
  \ objectives</a>.</p>
STRATCON_FACILITIES.title=StratCon Facilities
STRATCON_FACILITIES.definition=In <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>, the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area\
  \ of Operations</a> may contain special facilities. These facilities may be controlled by either your forces or the\
  \ enemy and may apply unique modifiers to your scenarios.\
 <p>If you're experiencing negative scenario modifiers from an enemy-controlled facility, it is crucial to locate and\
  \ neutralize (or capture) it. Modifiers from enemy facilities can mean the difference between a tough fight and a\
  \ complete massacre.</p>
STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES.title=Strategic Objectives
STRATEGIC_OBJECTIVES.definition=In <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> you will frequently be required to complete\
 \ several Strategic Objectives. This is usually ensuring you end the contract with a positive\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS'>Contract Victory Point (CVP)</a> score, but might also include\
 \ destroying or retaining control of a specific <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON_FACILITIES'>Facility</a>. Sometimes there\
 \ are specific, hidden, scenarios that you must find and complete.\
 <p>When completing a contract, you should select 'Partial Success' if you have not completed all Strategic\
 \ Objectives.</p>
STRIPPING_AND_REPAIRING.title=Stripping & Repairing a Unit
STRIPPING_AND_REPAIRING.definition=For work to be performed on a unit, it needs to be in one of two states: Repair or Strip.\
 <p>While in <b>Repair</b> mode, damaged or destroyed parts may be repaired and replaced.</p>\
 <p>While in <b>Strip</b> mode, your techs will attempt to remove parts from the selected unit.</p>\
 <p><b>Important:</b> always ensure your units are in the right state before ending the day if you are using the\
 \ automated <a href='GLOSSARY:MASS_REPAIR_MASS_SALVAGE'>Mass Repair, Mass Salvage</a> system. Otherwise, you might not\
 \ have a unit left after your techs have swarmed it overnight.</p>
SUPPORT_POINTS.title=Support Points
SUPPORT_POINTS.definition=In <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> you have access to a resource called 'Support\
 \ Points.' Support Points represent how willing your employer is to support your actions at a strategic level. In\
 \ addition to how well your Command/Admin personnel can liaise with their counterparts in Allied Command.\
 <p>Support Points are usually spent reinforcing scenarios, but sometimes special events will occur to give you\
 \ other opportunities to trade your employer's good graces.</p>\
 <p>You will usually begin a contract with a pool of Support Points with more gained periodically. Both of these are\
 \ determined by skill checks made by personnel in the Admin/Command profession.</p>
### T
TECH_TIME.title=Technician Available Minutes
TECH_TIME.definition=Each technician only has a limited number of minutes for jobs that may be performed on any given\
 \ day. Normally this is 480 minutes for technicians who have a technician <a href='GLOSSARY:PROFESSIONS'>profession</a>\
  \ as their primary profession, or 240 minutes if the profession is their secondary profession.\
 <p>In Campaign Options, There's an option for Technicians to use the <i>Administration</i> skill. If enabled, the\
 \ number of minutes each Technician can spend per day is adjusted depending on their <i>Administration</i> skill:</p>\
 <p>- <b>None</b>: 408 (primary) / 204 (secondary) minutes/day\
 <br>- <b>Ultra-Green</b>: 432 / 216 minutes/day\
 <br>- <b>Green</b>: 432 / 228 minutes/day\
 <br>- <b>Regular</b>: 480 / 240 minutes/day\
 <br>- <b>Veteran</b>: 504 / 252 minutes/day\
 <br>- <b>Elite+</b>: 528 / 264 minutes/day</p>
TEMP_PERSONNEL.title=Temporary Astechs & Medics
TEMP_PERSONNEL.definition=In MekHQ, we don't expect you to track every Astech and Medic in your campaign. Instead, these\
 \ personnel are abstracted. If you ever need more Astechs or Medics, head to the toolbar, select Marketplace and\
 \ then Astech Pool or Medic Pool as appropriate. Be aware that you are limited in how many Astechs or Medics you\
 \ can use. This is depending on how many active Medical and Tech teams you currently maintain, as per <b>Campaign\
 \ Operations</b>.\
 <p>You can tell MekHQ to automatically fill all teams when advancing to each new day. The settings for this (and much\
 \ more) may be found in MekHQ Options.</p>\
 <p>You are not required to use Temporary Personnel. Any permanent personnel will automatically be used instead of\
 \ temporary personnel when available.</p>
TOE.title=The TO&E
TOE.definition=Your Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) is a living representation of the military staffing and\
 \ equipment that comprise your unit. There, you arrange your forces into <a href='GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS'>Combat\
 \ Teams</a> and can get an overview of your available forces.\
 <p>It is important to note that units stored outside the TO&E are not normally considered for things like contract\
 \ pay, or <a href='GLOSSARY:FIELD_KITCHENS'>Field Kitchen</a> availability. For all intents and purposes, MekHQ will\
 \ ignore units stored loose in your hangar. So it may be useful to keep even non-combat units in the TO&E. Those,\
 \ however, should be stored in <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_TYPE_SUPPORT'>Support Forces</a> lest they be drawn into combat.
TURNING_POINT.title=Turning Points
TURNING_POINT.definition=Turning Points are scenarios of significant strategic importance. The exact reason a scenario\
  \ is designated as a Turning Point is left to your interpretation. It could be a battle over a critical location, an\
  \ engagement with a high-ranking enemy officer, or simply a mission under heightened scrutiny from Allied Command.\
  <p>Winning a Turning Point scenario grants you 1 <a href='GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS'>Contract Victory Point\
 \ (CVP)</a>. Losing, however, deducts 1 CVP and may push your score into negative territory, similar to losing a\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:CRISIS_SCENARIO'>Crisis</a> scenario.
TURNOVER.title=Turnover
TURNOVER.definition=Turnover is the system that determines when and why personnel might leave your campaign. It simulates\
  \ the natural flow of people in and out of your unit, adding depth and realism.\
 <p>Key causes of turnover include...</p>\
 <p>Fatigue:</b> Physical and mental exhaustion from sustained operations may cause characters to take a break or leave\
 \ permanently.</p>\
 <p><b>Employment Contracts:</b> Characters may leave when their contracts end.</p>\
 <p><b>Retirement:</b> Older characters may retire after reaching a certain age.</p>\
 <p><b>Resignation:</b> Characters may quit before their contract ends because of personal reasons or disagreements. Though\
 \ doing so will void any payouts they may have been owed.</p>\
 <p><b>Defection:</b> Characters may leave to join a rival faction.</p>\
 <p><b>HOW TURNOVER WORKS</b></p>\
 <p>By default, Turnover checks happen at the end of each month and after a contract ends. Each character's turnover\
 \ target number determines the likelihood they will leave. The target number is influenced by factors like\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:FATIGUE'>Fatigue</a>, <a href='GLOSSARY:ADMIN_STRAIN'>Administrative Strain</a>,\
 \ <a href='GLOSSARY:MANAGEMENT_SKILL'>Management Skill</a>, age, <a href='GLOSSARY:LOYALTY'>Loyalty</a>, and faction\
 \ relations. Paying a retention bonus can reduce the turnover target number and encourage characters to stay.</p>\
 <p><b>PAYOUTS</b></p>\
 <p>Resigning or retiring personnel receive a payout depending on their rank and role. Retiring personnel receive a larger\
 \ payout than those resigning. If a departing character brought their own unit (like a 'Mek), they expect it to be\
 \ returned or compensated (if that's not possible). If a character resigns before the end of their employment contract,\
 \ they are not entitled to any payout.</p>\
 <p><b>SPECIAL CASES</b></p>\
 <p>Family ties can influence turnover - spouses and children may leave together. Loyalty is a key factor in retention\
 \ and can shift depending on campaign events. Campaign <a href='GLOSSARY:FORCE_REPUTATION'>Reputation</a> and mission success\
 \ affect <a href='GLOSSARY:MORALE'>Morale</a> and turnover rates.</p>\
 <p>For more details on Turnover, refer to the documentation in:\
 <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module (feat. Fatigue).pdf</i></p>
### U
UNABLE_TO_START_SCENARIO.title=Unable to Start a Scenario?
UNABLE_TO_START_SCENARIO.definition=If you find yourself unable to start a scenario, double-check a couple of things:\
 <p>- That you have <a href='GLOSSARY:HOW_TO_DEPLOY'>deployed</a> units to the scenario.\
 <br>- That your campaign date matches the scenario date. You cannot fight a past or future scenario. Blame the\
 \ space-time continuum.</p>
### V
VEHICLE_CREWS.title=Vehicle & Vessel Crews
VEHICLE_CREWS.definition=Some vehicles have crew requirements outside of drivers and gunners. These 'seats' can be \
  filled by any character with one of the following professions (primary or secondary):\
  <p>- AeroTek\
  <br>- Any admin profession\
  <br>- Astech\
  <br>- Battle Armor Tech\
  <br>- Chef\
  <br>- Comms Operator\
  <br>- Doctor\
  <br>- Mechanic\
  <br>- Medic\
  <br>- MekTech\
  <br>- Soldier\
  <br>- Tech/Communications\
  <br>- Tech/Sensors\
  <br>- Combat Technicians</p>\
  <p>It is ultimately left to your discretion to decide what professions you use to fill these seats.</p>\
  <p>Large Vessels, such as DropShips, may also have crew requirements. These can only be filled by characters with \
  the Vessel Crewmember profession.</p>
VOCATIONAL_XP.title=Vocational XP
VOCATIONAL_XP.definition=Vocational XP is enabled by default in the New and Veteran Player presets.\
  <p>Vocational XP represents experience and improvement gained by a character doing their job. Whether that's fighting\
  \ in scenarios, repairing 'Meks, or keeping the warehouse in order. It reflects not just the duties characters perform\
  \ <i>on-screen</i> (that is to say, the things you tell them to do), but also the duties performed <i>off-screen</i>.\
  \ Things like patroling around a facility, filling out necessary paperwork, drilling, P.T., and the infinite array of\
  \ other duties that are not explicitly reflected in MekHQ.</p>\
  <p><b>But Wouldn't A Character Progress Faster by Fighting in a Scenario?</b></p>\
  <p>Any xp a character would have gained from being dispatched to a scenario (or doing a repair, or what have you) is\
  \ already factored into their monthly Vocational XP.\
  <p>However, there is another factor to consider, and the main reason why scenarios do not award XP by default anymore:\
  \ explicitly awarding XP for kills and scenarios merely acts as a 'progress more' feature.\
  <p>Essentially, if a character gains XP from doing well, they will progress faster. You will then use that character\
  \ more often, resulting in them getting more opportunities to gain XP. Which results in them progressing faster and\
  \ being deployed more often. Which results in them progressing even faster, and so on...</p>\
  <p>This creates a situation where favored characters start to 'snowball.' It also punishes you for using characters\
  \ other than your A-team. Because every time you drop with someone other than your A-team, suddenly that's xp not being\
