JumpBlockers.unableToJump.message.inCharacter={0}, I''m sorry to report that the following units are not suited for \
  hyperspace travel. Our options are limited. We can sell the affected units, abandon them, or refit them for \
  transit.</p>
JumpBlockers.unableToJump.message.outOfCharacter=The listed units are incapable of jump travel. For JumpShips and \
  WarShips the unit must have a working K-F Drive. For Space Stations the unit must either have a K-F Adaptor or be \
  classified as a modular space station. Mothballing will not bypass this issue. These units are just too big to \
  stuff into a cargo bay.
JumpBlockers.unableToJump.button.cancel=Cancel Journey
JumpBlockers.unableToJump.button.gm=Ignore Limitations (GM)
JumpBlockers.unableToJump.button.sell=Sell All Affected Units
JumpBlockers.unableToJump.button.abandon=Permanently Abandon All Affected Units
