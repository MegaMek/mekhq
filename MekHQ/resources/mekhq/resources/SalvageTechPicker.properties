SalvageTechPicker.instructions=Under CamOps salvage rules each recovery task depletes available time. Furthermore, if \
  the 'Risky Salvage' campaign option is enabled, each recovery task will require a 2d6 roll, with a random tech \
  being injured (possibly killed) on a roll of 2. The same tech can be injured multiple times, but the task will \
  always be successful. Clearly Astechs learn by example.\n\n\
  Assigning a tech to salvage operations will consume all of their remaining work minutes.
