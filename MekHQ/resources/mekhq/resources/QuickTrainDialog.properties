QuickTrainDialog.centerMessage.normal=Hey {0}, I agree our folks could use some training.\
  <p>I''ve drawn up a list of suitable courses.</p>
QuickTrainDialog.centerMessage.empty=I''m happy to arrange some training, but you haven''t told me who you want trained.
QuickTrainDialog.button.whoops=(Cancel) Whoops, I forgot to select anyone
QuickTrainDialog.button.cancel=(Cancel) I've changed my mind
QuickTrainDialog.button.single=(Singular) Let's go with one of the shorter courses
QuickTrainDialog.button.continuous=(Continuous) I think we should issue continuous classes
QuickTrainDialog.outOfCharacterMessage=<b>Quick Train</b> is designed to supplement Mass Training and tells selected \
  personnel to spend their XP to improve their profession skills (marked with a \u2605 in the character panel). \
  Please see the Glossary for a full explanation of how skills are selected for training.\
  <p><b>Singular</b>: Each eligible skill is improved once.\
  <br><b>Continuous</b>: Skills are improved repeatedly until no XP remains.</p>\
  <p>- Skills won't be upgraded if they exceed the character's available XP, at the max level, or push them past the \
  selected skill milestone (e.g., Green, Regular, Veteran).\
  <br>- You can tell MekHQ to run <b>Quick Train</b> at the end of each month automatically in MekHQ Options.\
  <br>- You can tell <b>Quick Train</b> to ignore a character by right-clicking on the character, heading to \
  <b>Flags</b> and enabling the Quick Train Ignore flag.
