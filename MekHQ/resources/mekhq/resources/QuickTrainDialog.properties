  <p>I''ve drawn up a list of suitable courses.</p>

QuickTrainDialog.button.whoops=(Cancel) Whoops, I forgot to select anyone
QuickTrainDialog.button.cancel=(Cancel) I've changed my mind
QuickTrainDialog.button.single=(Singular) Let's go with one of the shorter courses
QuickTrainDialog.button.continuous=(Continuous) I think we should issue continuous classes
QuickTrainDialog.outOfCharacterMessage=<b>Quick Train</b> lets selected personnel automatically spend their XP to \
  improve profession skills (marked with a \u2605 in the character panel).\
  <p>- Characters will train their lowest profession skills first.\
  <br>- Skills won't be upgraded if they exceed the character's available XP, at the max level, or push them past the \
  selected skill milestone (e.g., Green, Regular, Veteran).\
  <br>- Quick Train does not affect characters marked as students.\
  <br>- Only characters who already have the Artillery skill will be trained in Artillery gunnery.\
  <br>- For Infantry Gunnery and Vehicle Crew skills, only the highest relevant skill will be improved.</p>\
  <p><b>Singular</b>: Each eligible skill is improved once.\
  <br><b>Continuous</b>: Skills are improved repeatedly until no XP remains.</p>
