  <p>Let me join your unit. I''ll make sure you get more than just victories - you''ll get paid.\

FRAUDULENT.description.2={0} can sell a rusted-out ''Mek for triple its value and walk away\

FRAUDULENT.description.3={0}''s greatest skill isn''t combat or strategy - it''s deception. Every\

FRAUDULENT.ronin=Let me be clear - you don''t need to know the details, and I''m not going to tell you.\

GREEDY.description.2={0} never misses a chance to turn a profit. If there''s a way to squeeze\

GREEDY.description.3={0} sees the universe as one giant stockpile, and {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\

HOARDING.description.2={0} isn''t just careful - {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} possessive. {1}\

HOARDING.description.4={0} doesn''t believe in "too much." {5} personal stores overflow with\

  \ them. When scarcity comes knocking, {2}''ll be the one still standing.
HOARDING.description.5={0} sees every resource as {6} to claim and {6} to keep. Whether it''s\

  <p>I''m offering you someone who''s prepared for anything. You need a hard push into enemy territory?\

HOARDING.interviewerNote.0=Keeps everything that isn''t nailed down. Doesn''t share. Doesn''t trust.
HOARDING.interviewerNote.1=Survivalist mindset. Would rather let others go without than run dry.

THIEF.label=Thief
THIEF.description.0={0} has quick hands and an even quicker eye for opportunity. Whether it''s\

THIEF.description.1={0} doesn''t just steal - {2} {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes}. Money, gear, secrets\
  \ - nothing is off-limits. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} ownership as a temporary state, and if\
  \ someone isn''t strong or smart enough to hold onto what''s theirs, they don''t deserve to keep it.

THIEF.description.4=If it isn''t nailed down, {0} sees it as fair game. And even if it is nailed\

  \ {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} just take things; {2} {7, choice, 0#leave|1#leaves} people wondering\
  \ if they ever really had them to begin with. Every job is clean, calculated, and impossible to\
  \ trace back to {4}.
THIEF.ronin=Look, I''m not going to pretend I''m some paragon of virtue. I take things - money, tech,\
  \ information - whatever''s valuable and not nailed down. And if it is nailed down, well... that just\
  \ makes it more of a challenge, doesn''t it?\
  <p>You want someone who plays by the rules? Fine. But when those rules start getting in the way of\
  \ your success - when you need someone who can cut through the red tape, slip past security, and\
  \ take what your team needs - you''ll want me.\

  \ benefits {4} most in the moment.
UNPRINCIPLED.ronin=Let''s not waste time with the usual formalities. You''re building a unit to win -\
  \ not to make friends. You need someone who knows how to get things done, not someone who''s going\
  \ to hesitate because of some outdated notion of honor or fairness.\
  <p>Honor, loyalty, fairness - those are for people who don''t understand how the game works. The\
  \ only thing that matters is who''s left standing at the end, and I know how to make sure that''s\
  \ us. If I have to lie, cheat, or burn a few bridges along the way, well... you wouldn''t be\
  \ considering me if you couldn''t stomach that.</p>
UNPRINCIPLED.interviewerNote.0=Morality optional - does what works, not what''s right.
