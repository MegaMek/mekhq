  Only 'Meks and vehicles can participate in ground salvage. Only DropShips and WarShips can participate in space \
  salvage. Units that are not fully crewed cannot salvage.\n\n\
  This is an early implementation of the Rules as Written salvage rules. You cannot field strip salvage, and salvage \
  quality weapon effects are not implemented. For an overview of the full salvage rules, please see Campaign \
