  \ next conflict.
BELLIGERENT.description.2={0} could probably win more fights if {2} didn''t spend so much time\
  \ starting them. Whether it''s trash-talking over comms or throwing the first punch in a\

BRASH.description.1=To {0}, hesitation is just another word for failure. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#throw|1#throws} caution aside, charging headlong into danger with raw aggression\
  \ and an utter disregard for self-preservation. If survival means second-guessing, then maybe\

  \ always right? Every word, every step; every decision is made with the certainty of someone who\

CONFIDENT.description.4=There''s a quiet, unshakable certainty to {0}, the kind that makes people\
  \ listen when {2} {7, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks} and follow when {2} {7, choice, 0#lead|1#leads}. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} need to prove {4}self - {2} already {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\

  \ {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to take a step back when it matters most.
COURAGEOUS.description.5={0} doesn''t measure risk the way others do. Where they see danger, {2}\

  \ people killed.
DARING.description.2=If it''s crazy, reckless, or just plain stupid, {0} is probably already doing\

  \ a drink and takes it for a ride, laughing in the face of common sense all the way.
DARING.description.3={0} lives for the thrill of the impossible, drawn to challenges that make\

INFLEXIBLE.label=Inflexible
INFLEXIBLE.description.0={0} follows a plan to the letter and expects others to do the same. Once\

MURDEROUS.label=Murderous
MURDEROUS.description.0={0} doesn''t just fight to win - {2} {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} to annihilate.\
  \ Enemies aren''t obstacles to be overcome; they''re targets to be erased, and {2} won''t stop until\

MURDEROUS.description.3={0} doesn''t see battle as a contest - {2} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} it as\

  \ no interest in teaching it twice.

OVERBEARING.label=Overbearing

PACIFISTIC.label=Pacifistic

PACIFISTIC.description.2={0} doesn''t fight out of hatred or ambition - {2} {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\

  \ failure of diplomacy. If {2} could find another way, {2} would take it in a heartbeat.
PACIFISTIC.description.3={0} sees every conflict as a failure long before the first shot is\
