BLOODTHIRSTY.label=Bloodthirsty
BLOODTHIRSTY.description.0={0} revels in the chaos of battle, seeking out the most brutal\
  \ engagements with savage glee. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} enemies not as opponents but\
  \ as prey, and the battlefield as a hunting ground where only the strong survive.
BLOODTHIRSTY.description.1=To {0}, war is not just necessary - it is a craving, an addiction that\
  \ only destruction can satisfy. {1} {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes} no prisoners, showing no mercy,\
  \ and relishes the moment an enemy''s ''Mek crumples under {6} relentless assault.
BLOODTHIRSTY.description.2=For {0}, combat isn''t just a job - it''s a sport, and {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#are|1#is} always eager to rack up a higher score. {1} {7, choice, 0#treat|1#treats}\
  \ every battle like a game of "who can make the biggest explosion," cracking jokes over comms\
  \ while turning enemies into scrap. If war ever ended, {0} would probably be bored to death.
BLOODTHIRSTY.description.3={0} carries an insatiable hunger for destruction, {6} mind always\
  \ drawn to the raw power of things being pushed past their limits. There is no satisfaction in\
  \ stability - only in the knowledge that something, somewhere, is being torn apart.
BLOODTHIRSTY.description.4=Chaos isn''t an obstacle for {0}; it''s the natural state of things. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#are|1#is} most alive when everything around {4} is on the edge of collapse,\
  \ thriving in the turmoil where others falter.
BLOODTHIRSTY.description.5=There''s a glint in {0}''s eye that never quite fades, a restless energy\
  \ that crackles just beneath the surface. Whether in conversation or silence, there is an\
  \ intensity to {4}, quiet delight in the inevitable breakdown of order.
BLOODTHIRSTY.ronin=I''ve seen your work - you hit hard, but you could hit harder.\
  <p>I don''t fight to survive - I fight to hunt. War isn''t a duty; it''s a thrill. The sound of\
  \ breaking armor, the screams over comms - that''s what I live for. When the battlefield turns into\
  \ a graveyard, I know I''ve done my job right.</p>\
  <p>I''m not here for glory or a cause. I feel alive when I''m tearing something apart. Put me in the\
  \ thick of it, and I''ll make sure your enemies don''t just lose - they''ll suffer.</p>\
  <p>If you want clean kills, look elsewhere. But if you need someone who thrives in chaos and is\
  \ still standing when the smoke clears - I''m your answer.</p>\
  <p>Give the order, {0} - and watch the bodies fall.</p>

  <p>I don''t hesitate or second-guess. When the bullets fly and the lines break, I''ll be at the front\

AGGRESSIVE.label=Aggressive
AGGRESSIVE.description.0={0} believes the best defense is an overwhelming offense, always pushing\

  \ to give {6} opponents a chance to recover.
AGGRESSIVE.description.1=For {0}, battle is about domination - breaking the enemy''s line, their\

  \ and merciless, never stopping until there''s nothing left but smoking wreckage.
AGGRESSIVE.description.2=Subtlety isn''t {0}''s style - why waste time sneaking when {2} can just\

  \ to try and stop {4}. Tactics are for cowards - brute force gets the job done faster.
AGGRESSIVE.description.3={0} thrives on momentum, always pressing forward with an intensity that\
  \ makes backing down seem impossible. {1} {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to slow down, always\
  \ demanding more, pushing {4}self and everyone around {4} past their limits.
AGGRESSIVE.description.4=Patience is just wasted time in {0}''s eyes. {1} {7, choice, 0#meet|1#meets}\

AGGRESSIVE.ronin=I''ve seen how you run things - solid, but you could push harder.\
  <p>I don''t do patience. I hit first, hit hard, and keep hitting until nothing''s left standing.\
  \ Pressure wins battles. Give the enemy a second to breathe, and you''ve already lost.</p>\
  <p>If you want strategy, look elsewhere. But if you need someone who will crush your enemies and\
  \ keep pushing until the job''s done - I''m your answer.</p>\
  <p>I don''t slow down, back off, or stop. Give the order - I''ll handle the rest.</p>\
  <p>Let me know when you''re ready to stop playing around and start winning.</p>

  \ charge. Whether on the battlefield or in a briefing room, {2} {7, choice, 0#speak|1#speaks} with\
  \ confidence and expects to be heard - hesitation is not in {6} vocabulary.
ASSERTIVE.description.1=In a galaxy where hesitation means death, {0} carves a path forward with\
  \ unwavering determination. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} ask for permission and\

  \ when it counts.\
  <p>I don''t hesitate or wait for permission. I see the path forward, I take it - and I expect\

  <p>I''m not here to argue or second-guess. I execute, and I expect results. So, if you want someone\

  \ the smallest slight into an excuse to throw a punch - or fire a shot.
BELLIGERENT.description.1=Violence isn''t just a tool for {0} - it''s the default setting. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} every interaction as a challenge, every stare as a provocation, and\
  \ every battle as a chance to break something... or someone. Peace is just the pause before the\
  \ next conflict.
BELLIGERENT.description.2={0} could probably win more fights if {2} didn''t spend so much time\
  \ starting them. Whether it''s trash-talking over comms or throwing the first punch in a\
  \ negotiation, {2} {7, choice, 0#seem|1#seems} to believe the best way to solve a problem is by\
  \ making it someone else''s problem. Fist first.
BELLIGERENT.description.3={0} carries a permanent chip on {6} shoulder, always ready to turn a\

BELLIGERENT.ronin=I hear you''ve got a problem that needs solving - good. I''m looking for a fight.\
  <p>I don''t care if it''s an enemy on the battlefield or a loudmouth in the mess hall - I don''t back\

  \ next fight - and I''ll be ready when it starts.</p>\
  <p>If you want someone to smooth things over, keep looking. But if you need someone who hits first,\

  \ confidence - sometimes brilliant, sometimes reckless, but always decisive.
BRASH.description.1=To {0}, hesitation is just another word for failure. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#throw|1#throws} caution aside, charging headlong into danger with raw aggression\
  \ and an utter disregard for self-preservation. If survival means second-guessing, then maybe\
  \ survival isn''t worth it.
BRASH.description.2={0} never met a fight {2} didn''t think {2} could win. Whether it''s in combat,\
  \ making bets, or mouthing off to the wrong people, {0} jumps in without thinking - because,\

BRASH.description.3={0} lives by one rule: act now, figure out the details later. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#barrel|1#barrels} through obstacles with sheer confidence, trusting that if things\

BRASH.description.4=Subtlety and patience have never been {0}''s strengths. {1}\

  \ {7, choice, 0#consider|1#considers} {4}self a saint.
BRASH.description.5=There''s no such thing as overconfidence in {0}''s mind. Whether\
  \ {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} got the skills to back it up or not is irrelevant - {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#step|1#steps} into every situation like {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already won\
  \ and {7, choice, 0#let|1#lets} reality catch up later.
BRASH.ronin=I hear you''ve got a spot open. Good - I''m ready to jump in.\
  <p>I don''t waste time overthinking. You see an opportunity, you take it - fast and hard. Careful\
  \ planning is for people who like to sit on the sidelines. I''d rather throw myself into the fire\
  \ and figure it out on the way down.</p>\
  <p>Yeah, maybe it''ll catch up with me - but not today. If you want someone who overthinks\
  \ everything, keep looking. But if you need someone who trusts their gut and takes the shot when\
  \ it counts - you''ve found them.</p>\
  <p>Give the order - I''ll make it happen. Just try to keep up.</p>

  \ someone who expects to win - and usually does.
CONFIDENT.ronin=I''ve seen how you run things - solid, but you need someone who knows how to finish.\

PACIFISTIC.description.2={0} doesn''t fight out of hatred or ambition - {2} {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\

TENACIOUS.ronin=I''ve been through enough to know survival isn''t about strength or speed - it''s about\
  \ not stopping.\
  <p>I''m not here for glory or easy victories. I know how to survive. If I get knocked down, I get\

VIGILANT.ronin=I''ve learned the hard way that trusting the wrong person - or missing the wrong detail\
  \ - is how you end up dead.\
  <p>Nowadays, I don''t let my guard down. Ever. I see the angles others miss - the twitch of an enemy\
