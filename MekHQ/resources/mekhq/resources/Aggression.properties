BLOODTHIRSTY.description.1=To {0}, war is not just necessary - it is a craving, an addiction that\

BLOODTHIRSTY.ronin=I''ve been watching your work. You hit hard - but you could be hitting harder.\

  \ Enemies aren''t obstacles to be overcome; they''re targets to be erased, and {2} won''t stop until\
  \ the battlefield is silent.
MURDEROUS.description.1=For {0}, war isn''t just necessary - it''s personal. {1} {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes}\
  \ pleasure in destruction, savoring the screams over comms and the sight of burning wreckage. Mercy\
  \ is a foreign concept, and survival is only for those {2} {7, choice, 0#allow|1#allows} to crawl away.
MURDEROUS.description.2={0} doesn''t get angry - {2} {7, choice, 0#get|1#gets} efficient. Killing\
  \ isn''t about rage or revenge; it''s about eliminating threats as quickly and effectively as\
  \ possible. If {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} to wipe out an entire company to make a point, so be it.
MURDEROUS.description.3={0} doesn''t see battle as a contest - {2} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} it as\

  \ certainty that when the dust settles, {2}''ll be the last one standing.
MURDEROUS.description.4=Death isn''t just a consequence of war for {0} - it''s the objective. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#move|1#moves} through conflict like a reaper, methodical and unrelenting, leaving\
  \ nothing but silence and ruin in {6} wake.
MURDEROUS.description.5={0} isn''t satisfied with victory - {2} demands eradication. To {4}, an\
  \ enemy left standing is an enemy that wasn''t taught the right lesson, and {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has}\
  \ no interest in teaching it twice.
MURDEROUS.ronin=I''ve seen how you handle things. You''re efficient - clean. But you''re holding back.\
  \ That''s why I''m reaching out.\
  <p>I don''t fight to win. I fight to erase. Enemies don''t get second chances - they get turned to\
  \ wreckage. You need someone who understands that victory isn''t enough. Survival isn''t enough. The\
  \ only way to end a threat is to eliminate it - completely.</p>\
  <p>I''m not looking for glory, and I''m not here to make friends. I want the kind of fight where the\
  \ only sound left at the end is static on the comms and the crackle of burning metal. You need\
  \ someone who won''t hesitate, who won''t stop until the field is clear? That''s me.</p>\
  <p>No prisoners. No loose ends. You give the order - I''ll handle the rest.</p>\
  <p>Your call, {0}. But understand - once I start, I don''t stop.</p>

OVERBEARING.label=Overbearing
OVERBEARING.description.0={0} always takes charge - whether {2} should or not. {1}\

  \ exactly as {2} {7, choice, 0#want|1#wants}, even if it means steamrolling everyone else in the process.
OVERBEARING.description.1=To {0}, control isn''t a preference - it''s a necessity. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#dictate|1#dictates} every move, barks orders without question, and refuses to\
  \ tolerate disobedience. In {6} world, authority isn''t earned - it''s enforced.
OVERBEARING.description.2={0} knows best - just ask {4}. Whether it''s battle tactics, logistics,\
  \ or how to hold a damn coffee cup, {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} an opinion and makes sure everyone\
  \ hears it. If {0} had more hands, {2} would probably try to do everyone''s job at the same time.
OVERBEARING.description.3={0} doesn''t just take charge - {2} smothers every situation with {6}\
  \ presence. Whether giving orders or offering "advice," {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure {6}\
  \ voice is the loudest and {6} will is the only one that matters.
OVERBEARING.description.4=There''s no room for debate when {0} is around. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#dictate|1#dictates} the course of action with absolute certainty, expecting others\
  \ to fall in line without question - because, in {6} mind, there''s no alternative.
OVERBEARING.description.5={0} doesn''t believe in delegation, compromise, or second opinions. If\
  \ something needs to be done, {2}''ll do it {6} way - whether anyone asked for {6} help or not.
OVERBEARING.ronin=I''ve seen how you operate - not bad, but you could use someone who knows how to\
  \ keep things from falling apart. That''s why I''m reaching out.\
  <p>Let''s be clear: I don''t follow. I lead. When things get chaotic, you don''t sit around waiting\
  \ for input - you make the call, and you make sure everyone falls in line. That''s what I do. I\
  \ don''t tolerate hesitation, and I don''t waste time with second opinions. My way works - and if\
  \ you want results, you''ll let me handle it.</p>\
  <p>You''ve got potential - but potential doesn''t win battles. Control does. Discipline does. If you\
  \ want to keep your unit alive and put the enemy in the ground, you need someone who takes charge\
  \ and doesn''t flinch.</p>\
  <p>You give me a place in your ranks, {0}, and I''ll make sure things run the way they should.\
  \ You''ll get results - even if I have to drag the others across the finish line myself.</p>\
  <p>Let me know if you''re serious.</p>

PACIFISTIC.label=Pacifistic

  \ around {4}, testing convictions that grow harder to uphold with every battle.
PACIFISTIC.description.2={0} doesn''t fight out of hatred or ambition - {2} {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights}\
  \ because there''s no  other choice. Every battle is a necessary evil, and every trigger pull is a\
  \ failure of diplomacy. If {2} could find another way, {2} would take it in a heartbeat.
PACIFISTIC.description.3={0} sees every conflict as a failure long before the first shot is\
  \ fired. {1} {7, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} in finding solutions beyond violence, even when\

PACIFISTIC.description.4=To {0}, true strength lies in restraint. {1} {7, choice, 0#stand|1#stands}\
  \ firm in {6} belief that there''s always another way, no matter how much the galaxy tries to\
  \ prove {4} wrong.
PACIFISTIC.description.5={0} doesn''t seek victory - {2} {7, choice, 0#seek|1#seeks} peace. Every\
  \ fight, every battle, every loss only reinforces {6} conviction that the real war isn''t against\
  \ an enemy, but against the need to fight at all.
PACIFISTIC.ronin=I''ve seen enough war to know how it ends. Wreckage, loss, silence. That''s why I''m\
  \ reaching out.\
  <p>I''m not here because I want to fight. I''m here because sometimes you don''t get a choice. If\
  \ stepping into the line of fire means protecting others - means ending the fight before it spirals\
  \ out of control - then I''ll do it. But I''m not looking for glory. I''m not here for the kill\
  \ count.</p><p>You need someone who knows how to keep a cool head when others are reaching for the\

  \ do what needs to be done - but only if there''s no other way.</p>\
  <p>You''ve got a choice, {0}. If you want someone who fights because they have to - not\

  <p>Let me know where I''m needed.</p>

RECKLESS.label=Reckless

RECKLESS.description.2=Caution is boring, and {0} would rather go down in flames than play it safe.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#live|1#lives} for the thrill of insane risks, treating the battlefield like a\

RECKLESS.description.3={0} doesn''t believe in playing it safe. {1} {7, choice, 0#thrive|1#thrives}\
  \ on risk, constantly pushing limits and daring fate to keep up - because to {4}, caution is just \
  another word for hesitation.
RECKLESS.description.4=The line between confidence and recklessness is one {0} never bothers to\
  \ acknowledge. {1} {7, choice, 0#act|1#acts} on impulse, ignores warnings, and\

  \ before it''s too late.
RECKLESS.description.5={0} isn''t afraid of consequences - {2} simply {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\

RECKLESS.ronin=I''ve been running solo long enough to know that playing it safe doesn''t get you\

  <p>I don''t hesitate. I don''t overthink. You see a target, you hit it - fast and hard. If it works,\
  \ great. If it doesn''t... well, you''ll still come out ahead if you hit hard enough. I''m not afraid\
  \ of risk - hell, I live for it. You need someone who''ll take the shot no one else will? That''s\
  \ me.</p>\
  <p>Yeah, maybe it''ll catch up with me someday - but not today. So if you need someone who''s not\

RESOLUTE.description.2=When others falter, {0} is the rock they lean on. {1}\

  \ others to do the same, proving that true strength comes from never backing down, no matter how\

RESOLUTE.description.3={0} doesn''t bend, doesn''t break, and certainly doesn''t back down. {5}\

  <p>You need someone who holds the line when it starts to break? Someone who doesn''t get shaken when\

SADISTIC.label=Sadistic

  \ moment an enemy realizes they''ve lost but still have to endure the pain.
SADISTIC.description.1=For {0}, war isn''t just about winning - it''s about breaking the enemy in\

SADISTIC.description.2=Some warriors fight to survive. {0} fights for the fun of watching others\
