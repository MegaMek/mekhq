outOfCharacter.contractStart.normal=Each month your employer will offer you spare supplies from their depot. The contents\
  \ of these resupplies is tailored to your force and your warehouse. That means you will always be offered items you\
  \ are using, but if your warehouse is particularly well stocked your employer will choose to direct those spares\
  \ elsewhere.\
  <p>The <b>Negotiation</b> skill of your senior-most <b>Admin/Logistics</b> character significantly influences the quality\
  \ of resupplies.</p>\
  <p>Resupplies are meant to ease the logistics demands of a contract, but they are not intended to replace\
  \ normal procurement. While you are en route to the contract location considered checking the Parts in Use dialog and\
  \ seeing if there is any supplies you're likely to deplete. You don't want to run out of left arms if you have to wait\
  \ 3 months for a left arm to arrive.</p>\

outOfCharacter.intercepted=Your convoy has been intercepted and a special <a href='GLOSSARY:CRISIS_SCENARIO'>Crisis</a>\
  \ scenario has been generated. Refusing to fight this engagement will result in the loss of the convoy and its contents.
outOfCharacter.convoyPicker=If you have the cargo capacity it's generally a good idea to use your own convoys. However,\
  \ this is a risk as it means placing your forces in the line of fire.\
  <p>You should avoid sending out convoys while the enemy has high morale. You should also try to keep the total unit\
  \ weight of your convoys below 200t as the heavier the convoy the easier it is to intercept.</p>
outOfCharacter.focus=Your employer will refuse to resupply parts you already have large quantities\
  \ of. For those items your employer is willing to supply a Negotiation check must be made, if the\
  \ check is failed the item will be unavailable. If all options are disabled you either have a well\
  \ stocked warehouse, or your most senior Admin/Logistics character may not be up to the task.\
  <p>Full documentation can be found in ''MekHQ/docs/Stratcon and Against the Bot''</p>
outOfCharacter.itinerary=If your resupply seems smaller than expected it's possible your warehouse is well stocked and\
  \ your employer (or smuggler) withheld supplies. Alternatively your negotiator may have performed poorly when negotiating\
  \ for resources.\
  <p>You negotiatiator is normally your senior-most Admin/Logistics character, however interactions with smugglers use\
  \ your campaign commander, instead.</p>\

# getDialogReference (salvage)
salvaged0.text=The salvage team just finished their sweep. Some of the cargo is\
  \ practically brand new, with no visible wear or damage - a rare find in these\
  \ conditions. On the other hand, much of it looks like it''s been scavenged\
  \ multiple times before. Even the rougher pieces could still serve us well in a\
  \ pinch, provided we use them wisely. {0}
salvaged1.text=We pulled a variety of supplies from the last skirmish. Some items are in\
  \ nearly perfect condition, almost as if they were never used. Others appear\
  \ cobbled together, likely just to stay functional. Still, this batch has clear\
  \ tactical potential, especially once we sift through it to separate the gems\
  \ from the junk. {0}
salvaged2.text=This latest batch of captured cargo is better than anticipated. A fair portion\
  \ is fully functional, ready for immediate use. However, some items seem to be\
  \ held together by sheer desperation and duct tape. We''ll need to sort through\
  \ everything quickly to identify which assets can be put to use right away. {0}
salvaged3.text=We''ve secured a decent amount of usable material from the enemy''s hold. There''s\
  \ a mix of pristine equipment and some more battered remnants. The newer gear\
  \ could directly enhance our operations, while the rougher pieces might require\
  \ a few quick repairs before they''re combat-ready again. {0}
salvaged4.text=Our salvage efforts have yielded a diverse collection of materials. Some of\
  \ it is in excellent condition, suggesting it was either new or barely used.\
  \ However, quite a bit looks like it was hastily patched together. We''ll need\
  \ to get creative if we want to make the most out of these less pristine items. {0}
salvaged5.text=The latest cache of captured supplies ranges from nearly untouched to barely\
  \ usable. The high-quality finds could improve our tactical operations\
  \ immediately. The more damaged pieces will require some work, but with effort,\
  \ they could still hold significant value for our ongoing needs. {0}
salvaged6.text=The latest load presents an interesting mix. Some items are untouched,\
  \ seemingly ready for immediate deployment, while others appear to have been\
  \ salvaged several times over. The less pristine pieces will require some quick\
  \ maintenance, but we can still derive tactical utility from this batch. {0}
salvaged7.text=This captured cargo exhibits a wide spectrum of quality. A few items are\
  \ in mint condition, as if they were meant for delivery to a fresh unit.\
  \ However, the rest will need more than a bit of maintenance before they can be\
  \ fielded, though they still have potential value. {0}
salvaged8.text=The latest haul includes a surprising number of intact materials, but not\
  \ everything is in such good shape. While many items are ready for immediate\
  \ use, others are clearly not worth adding to the attached itinerary due to\
  \ their poor condition. {0}
salvaged9.text=We''ve managed to pull a wide array of resources from the enemy''s stores.\
  \ Some of it is still in original packaging, which is rare given the\
  \ circumstances. The rest ranges from passable to dilapidated, but even the\
  \ worst of it could be refurbished with some effort. {0}

looted0.text=With our departure finally approaching, we managed to secure the most\
  \ valuable supplies we could find. Most of it was in decent condition, but\
  \ we were limited to what we could physically carry. The bulkier items were\
  \ left behind, as we simply didn''t have the energy or space to take them along\
  \ on this final stretch. {0}
looted1.text=We looted what we could, focusing on the highest-value supplies to maximize\
  \ our haul. Most of the items were ready for transport, but we were exhausted\
  \ by then. We opted to leave behind anything that wasn''t essential, or that would\
  \ have required significant effort to move. {0}
looted2.text=We managed to grab the most essential supplies, but it felt like the last\
  \ leg of a marathon. While some items were in good shape and easy to carry,\
  \ we simply lacked the energy to deal with anything that required extra\
  \ handling or repair work, so we left those behind. {0}
looted3.text=We''ve secured the best supplies we could find, and now we''re finally getting\
  \ out of here! Most of the items we took are in good condition, and we only\
  \ carried what was easily transportable. Leaving behind the bulkier stuff was\
  \ a strategic decision, and it feels like a win in this tough situation. {0}
looted4.text=Securing the supplies went smoother than expected, and we''re now ready to lift\
  \ off! We focused on grabbing the most critical items, leaving the less essential\
  \ ones behind without hesitation. Knowing that we''re done here brings a sense\
  \ of relief, and it feels good to be moving forward. {0}
looted5.text=We managed to secure the most useful supplies, and it''s finally time to say\
  \ goodbye to this place. We took only the most transportable items, leaving behind\
  \ anything too bulky or cumbersome. The team is in high spirits - just glad to be\
  \ getting off this rock and onto the next phase of our journey. {0}
looted6.text=We''ve gathered the necessary supplies as planned. Most of the items were\
  \ in good condition, and we prioritized those that were easily transportable.\
  \ Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we had to leave the bulkier items\
  \ behind, which was expected but still frustrating. {0}
looted7.text=We''ve grabbed what supplies we could manage, prioritizing items in decent\
  \ condition. We had to leave many things behind, focusing only on the essentials.\
  \ Given our limited capacity, we don''t have the time or space to carry more,\
  \ so we''re making do with what we have. {0}
looted8.text=We''ve packed up the most valuable supplies we could find, but it''s a desperate\
  \ load. We had to leave a lot of potentially useful materials behind due to space\
  \ and time constraints. It feels like we''re leaving part of our future here,\
  \ but there was simply no other option. {0}
looted9.text=We finished securing the supplies, but it doesn''t feel like enough. We\
  \ managed to load the basics, but many vital items had to be left behind. We''re\
  \ departing with what we could carry, but it feels like we''re barely scraping\
  \ by as we move forward. {0}

guerrillaSwindled0.text={0}, you really thought I''d come through, huh? It''s almost sweet.\

guerrillaSwindled10.text={0}, sometimes you gotta respect the art of a good con.\

guerrillaSwindled11.text=Hey {0}, heard there''s a fine line between bravery and\
  \ foolishness - guess you found it. I''ll be raising a glass to you from\

  \ don''t worry about me.
guerrillaSwindled12.text={0}, all those C-Bills for a ghost and a promise. You''ve\
  \ made it far, but you slipped up this time. I''ll be long gone by the\
  \ time you read this, probably sipping a PPC. Thanks for bankrolling the journey.
guerrillaSwindled13.text={0}, when it comes to playing the odds, sometimes you''re\
  \ on the wrong side. Consider this my parting gift - your C-Bills are\
  \ mine, and you''re on your own against {1}. Don''t take it too hard.\
  \ It''s just business.
guerrillaSwindled14.text={0}, I was almost tempted to come through. But you made\
  \ the deal way too easy, and where''s the fun in that? I''ll be putting\
  \ those C-Bills to better use than you ever would''ve. By the time\
  \ you''ve pieced this together, I''ll be jumps away. Good luck out there with {1}.
guerrillaSwindled15.text={0}, you really ought to be more careful who you trust.\
  \ Those C-Bills of yours are already well spent, and you''re left holding\
  \ the bag. Hope you and {1} have fun without me.
guerrillaSwindled16.text={0}, next time, maybe don''t believe everything you hear.\
  \ I''m already gone, and your C-Bills are going to fuel a far more\
  \ comfortable life than the one you''re fighting for. Thanks for\
  \ the funding!
guerrillaSwindled17.text={0}, business is all about taking opportunities, wouldn''t\
  \ you say? You just happened to be my opportunity this time. Your C-Bills\
  \ are history, and so am I. Good luck keeping up with {1} without my help.
guerrillaSwindled18.text={0}, it''s impressive how easy it was to slip away with\
  \ those C-Bills. Consider it a compliment to my talents and a lesson\
  \ for you. You''re on your own against {1} now - I''ll be sure to think\
  \ of you...occasionally.
guerrillaSwindled19.text={0}, let''s be real - this was a one-sided deal from the start.\
  \ I walk away with your C-Bills, and you''re left with nothing but regrets.\
  \ Enjoy the fight with {1}; I''ll enjoy the spoils.
guerrillaSwindled20.text={0}, I''d say I''m sorry, but I''d be lying. Your C-Bills are\
  \ funding my next venture, far from your troubles with {1}. Maybe next time\
  \ you''ll think twice before trusting a smooth talker.
guerrillaSwindled21.text={0}, you know, there''s an art to taking someone for a ride.\
  \ Thanks for the contribution - I''ll put it to good use. Meanwhile, {1} is\
  \ still breathing down your neck, and I''m already in the wind. Take care!
guerrillaSwindled22.text={0}, by the time you figure out just how bad I played you,\
  \ I''ll be just a regret. Those C-Bills are long gone, just like me.\
  \ Good luck with {1} - you''ll need it.
guerrillaSwindled23.text={0}, looks like the student got schooled. Your C-Bills are\
  \ fueling my next big adventure, and all you''ve got is a bitter reminder.\
  \ Give {1} my regards. I''ll be miles away by now.
guerrillaSwindled24.text={0}, call it a life lesson: trust is expensive. While you''re\
  \ out there scraping by against {1}, I''ll be enjoying every C-Bill you sent\
  \ my way. Don''t take it too hard - some of us are just born for this.

statusUpdate0.text=Joined by an allied logistics convoy for a quick fuel exchange, {0}. The process\
  \ was efficient, each team working methodically to ensure no time was lost. The convoy''s pace has\
  \ picked up again, with both units maintaining a strong formation. There''s a sense of\
  \ camaraderie, even in these brief encounters - each group focused on their respective tasks but\
  \ united by the same overarching mission.
statusUpdate1.text=We''re currently passing through burned-out villages, {0}. The destruction is\
  \ having an impact on crew morale. However, discipline remains intact, and the team understands\
  \ the importance of maintaining focus on the mission. The convoy''s pace is steady, and we are\
  \ proceeding without deviation from the planned route. All units are maintaining formation, with\
  \ heightened vigilance for potential ambushes or hidden threats. No delays expected; we continue\
  \ to operate at optimal speed.
statusUpdate2.text=Evasive maneuvers drained fuel faster than expected, {0}. The crew had to dodge\
  \ incoming missile salvos from enemy ''Meks, which spiked our fuel consumption. We''ve adjusted\
  \ speed and switched to tighter convoy formations to conserve what''s left. Spirits remain good,\
  \ with jokes about how it''s just another day dodging SRMs and LRMs. Scouts are looking for\
  \ potential fuel caches, possibly left behind by retreating forces. We''re also rerouting to a\
  \ safer path, taking advantage of lower inclines to ease fuel demands. Morale is high, and the\
  \ crew''s handling it well - typical day on the job. We''re confident about reaching the next\
  \ checkpoint without delays.
statusUpdate3.text=Met an allied logistics convoy running low on fuel and rations, {0}. The exchange\
  \ was routine, carried out with the efficiency of those used to survival in harsh conditions.\
  \ The strain was evident in their faces. The crew presses forward. ETA to delivery is 17 hours,\
  \ with steady progress.
statusUpdate4.text=Reached a makeshift checkpoint run by starving civilians, {0}. They asked for\
  \ food, but we had none to give. Their desperation was palpable, etched into their gaunt faces\
  \ and hollow eyes. We pushed through without incident, but the scene stays with us, another\
  \ reminder of the misery that defines this war. The crew is quiet, morale low - there''s no sense\
  \ of victory in pushing forward, only a grim determination to complete the mission. ETA to\
  \ delivery is 17 hours, but the burden of what we cannot change grows heavier.
statusUpdate5.text=Sorry for the blackout, {0}, radio antenna was bent by a low-hanging branch. The\
  \ team just finished a quick field repair, restoring full communication capabilities without any\
  \ additional issues. All units are maintaining contact, with regular check-ins confirmed. The\
  \ convoy is proceeding as planned, with no deviation from the established route. No delays are\
  \ expected at this time.
statusUpdate6.text=We''ve had to take a detour due to trees blocking the road, {0}.\
   \ Way too suspicious to just be a freak of nature. I''ve sent patrols out into the woods after\
   \ crew members reported they saw movement in the treeline.\
   \ I''m going to go out with the next patrol whilst the techs keep clearing the road.\
   \ If I had to take a guess, {0}, the OpFor is trying to canalize us onto an ambush route further\
   \ ahead. I''ve ordered all escort forces to extend the perimeter and switch through all sensor bands.\
   \ ETA still stands at 18 hours, provided we get the blockage cleared on time.
statusUpdate7.text=Water levels have reached critical, {0}. Hydration rations have been adjusted to\
  \ extend remaining supplies. The crew is feeling the strain, but they understand the necessity.\
  \ We''re pushing forward, with all personnel adhering to updated water protocols. An adjusted ETA\
  \ of 17 hours has been communicated to all units. No further complications are anticipated.
statusUpdate8.text={0}, we just left the remains of a bombed out village. We saw children huddled\
  \ under makeshift tents, some looked up as we passed, but most didn''t bother. The sight was\
  \ haunting, their small figures barely visible against the backdrop of ruin. The convoy pressed\
  \ on, each driver focused on the road, yet the mood feels hollow - like a mechanical march\
  \ through a world that''s lost its meaning. There''s no room for compassion here, only survival.\
  \ ETA to delivery is 18 hours, but the emptiness remains.
statusUpdate9.text=Arrived at an allied field camp recently hit by enemy ''Meks, {0}. The MedTechs\
   \ were busy with fresh casualties. These guys got messed up here, {0}. I got out and had a talk\
   \ with their commander whilst we dropped off our supplies. Some real nasty work here -\
   \ the ''Meks were using Infernos. Even the chatty guys on the crew are quiet now. ETA to delivery is 17\
   \ hours.
statusUpdate10.text=A small group of refugees tried to approach, {0}, but we had to speed up for\
  \ security reasons. We''re not running a charity service, after all. The crew''s gone quiet again,\
  \ trying to swallow the bitter truth that survival trumps sympathy out here. The guilt is heavy.\
  \ ETA to delivery is still 18 hours, though each one feels longer than the last.
statusUpdate11.text=Stopped briefly to refuel an allied convoy, {0}. The drivers looked tired, but\
  \ the handoff was quick and to the point. The convoy is back in motion, keeping pace toward the\
  \ next checkpoint. ETA to delivery remains 17 hours, with no interruptions expected.
statusUpdate12.text={0}, a woman carrying an infant waved desperately as we approached the last\
  \ village. We had nothing to give, so we kept moving. The crew tried to maintain focus, but\
  \ there''s a sense of heaviness that comes with repeated exposure to scenes like this. The reality\
  \ of the situation is clear: we''re here to deliver military supplies, not to play saviors. The\
  \ convoy maintains its pace, though there''s a weight in my heart. ETA to delivery remains 18\
  \ hours.
statusUpdate13.text=Reached an allied checkpoint, {0}. The soldiers took the supplies quietly, their\
  \ tired eyes reflecting the same exhaustion we see in each other. It''s a scene we''ve repeated\
  \ countless times - quick exchanges under grim circumstances. We''re moving on, but the mood is\
  \ heavy. The crew feels it, a sense of helplessness that lingers long after we leave each\
  \ checkpoint behind. ETA to delivery is 17 hours.
statusUpdate14.text=Our lead vehicle experienced a sudden sensor glitch, {0} - a brief but total brown\
   \ out that left us vulnerable. Cause is unknown, and the crew is on edge, suspecting sabotage.\
   \ One of the guys started mouthing off over the comm about gremlins in the machinery - had to\
   \ put him on a charge to keep discipline. The techs patched it up, but its spooked the crew. We''re\
   \ moving carefully, with extra scans and sensors active. ETA remains 18 hours, {0}\
statusUpdate15.text=Coolant levels dropped suddenly, {0}, forcing an unexpected halt. Diagnostics\
   \ traced the issue to a minor breach, likely caused by bottoming out on the rough roads here.\
   \ Techs patched it up efficiently, using some reinforced seals - fingers crossed. Crew\
   \ is alert but it''s not too bad out here - everything feels pretty routine. Extra\
   \ coolant has been distributed among vehicles, and the techs put some extra diagnostics in.\
   \ There''s even some banter about what the coolant does to your chance of having kids. Morale is\
   \ strong, and we''re pushing forward without any major delays. Convoy is on schedule, {0}.
statusUpdate16.text=Fuel''s dropping rapidly, {0}. Rough terrain caught us off-guard, and retreating\
   \ enemy ''Meks left craters along the roads to try and cut key routes. We''re making adjustments to\
   \ stretch our reserves, but it''s critical now. I''ve slowed our pace to maximize\
   \ efficiency, but that won''t last if more combat breaks out.\
   \ There''s some chatter amongst the crews about potential fuel resupply options,\
   \ but we''re far from any friendly base. We''ve sent a recon patrol ahead to scout for possible\
   \ emergency caches or civilian fuel stations. No delays projected yet, but the situation is\
   \ precarious. Crew''s prepared for defensive actions if we encounter hostiles during fuel foraging.
statusUpdate17.text=Civilians waved us down, as we left through the last checkpoint, {0}. They were\
   \ begging for medical supplies, but we didn''t stop. Their disappointment was clear, and a few\
   \ tried to block the route. The checkpoint guards moved them off with warning shots. It shook up\
   \ my guys but we''re still en route. ETA to delivery is 18 hours, {0}
statusUpdate18.text=An allied logistics unit requested spare parts, {0}. I refused the request,\
   \ my guess is they were trying to shark us out of our gear. We''re still en route, and\
   \ they''ve got their own supply lines. ETA to delivery is 17 hours, with no expected delays.
statusUpdate19.text=Missing fuel traced to a punctured tank, {0} - likely damage from stray laser\
  \ fire during a previous skirmish. We''re redistributing remaining fuel reserves across the convoy\
  \ to maintain movement. The situation is tight, but so far, no delays are projected. Crew''s\
  \ prepping for possible emergency refueling if needed.
statusUpdate20.text=We came across some crates near an abandoned checkpoint, {0}. Evidence suggests a\
   \ previous supply convoy came under heavy fire and had to abandon cargo during their retreat. We\
   \ secured what we could, including ammo and medical supplies. Techs believe some\
   \ crates contain Class-C Coolant, which could come in useful. We''re back en route now, though\
   \ the discovery has sparked concerns over enemy activity in the area. We''ve added patrols to\
   \ cover the rear in case of ambush. We''ll assess the contents of the salvaged crates at the next\
   \ checkpoint. Convoy, out.
statusUpdate21.text=Blocked pass ahead, {0} - fallen trees and debris, likely remnants of a recent\
  \ skirmish. Clearing it took longer than expected, with scouts maintaining a constant watch for\
  \ potential ambushes. It''s a bleak routine - clearing, advancing, expecting the worst, and\
  \ finding nothing but more debris in a war that never seems to change. ETA is 17 hours, but no\
  \ guarantees at this rate.
statusUpdate22.text=Misjudged water reserves, {0}, forcing us to ration supplies more tightly.\
  \ Located additional water canisters at an abandoned outpost, likely left behind during a rapid\
  \ retreat. Crew is grumbling over the reduced rations, but discipline holds. No delays are\
  \ expected for now, but the harsh conditions are affecting efficiency. We''re actively searching\
  \ for other possible resupply points.
statusUpdate23.text=Came across an allied patrol running low on fuel, {0}. The exchange was handled\
  \ efficiently - just a quick transfer of fuel before we both resumed our respective routes. The\
  \ convoy is back in formation, maintaining a steady pace as we push forward. ETA to delivery is\
  \ 17 hours, expecting no further delays.
statusUpdate24.text=An emergency frequency flared up briefly, {0}. It sounded like a weak distress\
  \ call, likely from a downed ''MekWarrior or an allied recon unit caught behind lines. Given the\
  \ risks, we didn''t break formation to respond. The crew remains calm - it''s not the first time\
  \ we''ve heard distress signals on this route. We''re keeping channels open, just in case it''s a\
  \ friendly in need. Morale is stable, with some light banter over the comms to maintain spirits.\
  \ No delays expected as we continue.
statusUpdate25.text=A collapsed bridge forced a route change, {0} - possibly the result of sabotage.\
  \ An alternate crossing was identified, and the convoy is back on track. The delay was minimal.\
  \ All units are aware of potential risks associated with the detour, including possible ambush\
  \ points. The crew is maintaining focus. No major delays are expected as we proceed.
statusUpdate26.text=Crossed paths with allied scouts, {0}. Their vehicles appeared intact, but the\
  \ scouts themselves were tense, and reported possible activity in this sector. ETA to delivery remains 18\
  \ hours, with no delays expected.
statusUpdate27.text=We linked up with an allied logistics convoy that needed basic repairs, {0}. We\
  \ handed off some spare parts and took a break to get them moving again. A few of the crew shared\
  \ small items with them - they seemed to be in pretty rough shape. Each stop on this route\
  \ feels pretty tense; everybody seems to feel like we could get jumped out here.\
  \ ETA to delivery is 17 hours.
statusUpdate28.text=Reached an allied outpost that showed clear signs of a recent skirmish, {0}.\
   \ Torn sandbags, bullet holes in the walls, and soldiers with dusty uniforms greeted us. Their\
   \ readiness was high despite the signs of battle still fresh around them. The supply handoff was\
   \ fast before we resumed our route. The crew is staying alert, eyes scanning the horizon for\
   \ potential threats. Pretty easy going, but the crew are sleeping by their weapons on breaks. ETA\
   \ to delivery remains 18 hours.
statusUpdate29.text=GPS signal cut out near a known ambush site, {0}. This could be a result of\
  \ residual jamming from previous encounters. All units are proceeding with heightened caution,\
  \ maintaining full situational awareness. Sensors have been recalibrated to account for potential\
  \ interference, and the crew is prepared for ambush. No delays are expected, but all personnel\
  \ will remain on alert until we clear the area.
statusUpdate30.text=Civilians just crowded the convoy, {0}, desperate for water or some such. We had\
   \ to keep moving, because "rationing" doesn''t include charity drops. The crew''s trying to stay\
   \ focused, but a few of the guys think we should''ve done more for them. At least we''re\
   \ efficient, if not empathetic. ETA to delivery holds at 17 hours.
statusUpdate31.text=We met an allied recon team, {0}, near Nav Point Gamma. They were patrolling our sector\
   \ and looked like they''d been out for some time. They told us they''d lost a few guys back down the road\
   \ and we shared a drink with them before moving on. The encounter was brief, but\
   \ the guys appreciated the chance to catch up with some fellow fighters out here. ETA to delivery\
   \ is 17 hours, with no expected delays, {0}.
statusUpdate32.text=We saw some children scavenging in the ruins of an old market as we passed, {0}.\
  \ It was hard to ignore, but the crews obeyed the NO STOP orders and kept moving through the town.\
  \ We had to stop the lead vehicle when a few of them ran out into the road - the guys didn''t\
  \ like clearing them off. We''re back moving now, {0}; ETA to delivery remains 17 hours.
statusUpdate33.text=Landslides have hit the main cargo road, {0}, forcing us to reroute to a path\
  \ closer to contested zones. It''s a necessary risk, but one that adds to the sense of futility\
  \ - rerouting, retreating, always adapting, yet never truly advancing. It''s as if the road itself\
  \ resists our passage. ETA remains at 18 hours, but the sense of inevitable confrontation looms.
statusUpdate34.text=My comm''s guy intercepted a faint distress signal, {0}. It''s weak, barely a whisper\
   \ in the static. Could be downed ally, or it could be a trap set by the enemy. Weird tone too,\
   \ it doesn''t match up to any of the frequencies in the recent codebooks. We''ve focused the source, trying\
   \ to verify its origin, but no joy. We''re proceeding at alert status. No delays\
   \ expected, but I''ve got a few jokers talking about ghosts on the crew now.
statusUpdate35.text=We had a few civilians try to flag us down, {0}, hoping for help. We didn''t stop, as the\
   \ risk to the convoy was too great. With the way it''s been going out here, it could''ve been an ambush.\
   \ The civvies are desperate out here, {0}. It''s getting to be an all too familiar\
   \ scene on this route - lots of refugees. It''s shaken the crews a bit.\
   \ ETA to delivery holds at 17 hours, with no significant delays expected.
statusUpdate36.text={0}, there''s women and kids on the road through this town asking for help. I''ve\
   \ issued NO STOP orders to the convoy but it''s rough out here. My crews are all pretty rattled\
   \ and complaining about not being able to halt and help these folks.\
   \ When we get back I need to speak to the logi'' guys about our convoy route planning;\
   \ we''ve got to avoid these kinds of places or we''ll start having real trouble in the crews.\
   \ Still on for our ETA, {0}, but it''ll be tight.
statusUpdate37.text=Reached an allied checkpoint that had just repelled an attack, {0}. The soldiers\
  \ were still on high alert, eyes scanning the surroundings for any lingering threats. We were\
  \ passed through the checkpoint quickly. ETA to delivery remains 18 hours, with all systems\
  \ nominal.
statusUpdate38.text=Dense fog has swallowed the convoy, {0}, thick as smoke. Visibility is near\
  \ zero. We''ve seen this kind of cover before - an ideal screen for enemy ambushes. The convoy\
  \ crawls forward, engines hushed, the only sound a distant metallic clanking that seems to\
  \ come from nowhere and everywhere at once. Crew moves slowly, with every nerve on edge. Delays\
  \ are likely.
statusUpdate39.text=Came across civilians searching through debris for food, {0}. They were too\
  \ exhausted to react as we passed, eyes hollow and movements slow. The sight was haunting - a\
  \ reminder of what these endless conflicts have reduced people to. The crew remained silent,\
  \ their expressions matching the somber scene outside. There was nothing we could do for them;\
  \ all we could offer was a fleeting glance of sympathy before moving on. The mood in the convoy\
  \ is heavy, and it''s clear that the war is weighing on everyone. No delays expected, but the\
  \ emptiness lingers.
statusUpdate40.text=Reached an allied resupply post, {0}. The soldiers were organized, moving\
  \ quickly to handle the exchange. The convoy''s speed is steady. ETA to delivery is 18 hours, with\
  \ no expected delays.
statusUpdate41.text=Just passed a makeshift graveyard, {0}. Civilians were burying the dead, their\
  \ faces etched with a grim acceptance of the war''s toll. The convoy kept moving, the sight met\
  \ with silent indifference from the crew. There''s no shock, just a dull recognition that this\
  \ conflict leaves no one untouched. ETA to delivery is 18 hours.
statusUpdate42.text=An allied MedTech unit flagged us for supplies, {0}. They accepted the crates\
  \ quietly, their expressions drained but determined. It''s clear that the toll of this conflict is\
  \ not just physical but mental as well. The convoy continues forward, each driver resolute,\
  \ knowing that our delivery supports those still fighting. ETA to delivery holds at 18 hours.
statusUpdate43.text=Lead vehicle experienced a sudden loss of steering, {0}. Emergency repairs were\
  \ conducted swiftly by mechanics, who suspect worn cables as the root cause. The crew is\
  \ understandably cautious. We''ve resumed movement, maintaining full convoy integrity. Mechanics\
  \ will perform a more thorough inspection at the next scheduled stop. All personnel have been\
  \ briefed on emergency protocols, and no significant delays are anticipated.
statusUpdate44.text=Food rations came up short, {0}. Inventory checks show missing supplies - either\
  \ an error or theft. There''s a creeping paranoia among the crew, as if someone within our ranks\
  \ is hiding something. We''re rationing what''s left, but the reduced meals add a gnawing hunger.\
  \ ETA remains 18 hours, assuming no more surprises.
statusUpdate45.text=Discovered a slow fuel leak during inspection, {0}. Likely caused by shrapnel\
  \ from our last skirmish with enemy BattleMeks. Techs performed a swift patch, reinforcing weak\
  \ spots. We''re monitoring fuel levels more closely to ensure stability. Crew remains alert but\
  \ isn''t worried - this kind of repair is par for the course. Spirits are high, with some crew\
  \ sharing stories of repairs under fire. ETA holds at 18 hours, with no expected delays, so long\
  \ as the repairs hold.
statusUpdate46.text=Cooling systemFluff failure reported on one of our cargo trucks, {0} - strong\
  \ suspicion of sabotage by enemy operatives. This happened during a planned stop, making it\
  \ likely that infiltrators tampered with our systems overnight. Tech crews executed rapid field\
  \ repairs, but the incident has shaken trust among the team. We''ve doubled the watch and added\
  \ sensor sweeps for sabotage detection. Tension is high, especially with scout reports of\
  \ possible enemy ''Mek sightings nearby. We''re continuing our push, aiming to maintain\
  \ pace, but we''re ready for an engagement. ETA to the drop-off remains at 18 hours.
statusUpdate47.text=Medical kits are running low, {0}, after treating minor injuries during our last\
  \ retreat. Crew is rationing remaining supplies, focusing on essentials. Despite the shortage,\
  \ there''s a sense of camaraderie, with jokes about "field fixes" and toughing it out like the old\
  \ days. Resupply will be necessary soon, but for now, spirits are positive. No delays expected,\
  \ and ETA is steady at 18 hours as we press forward.
statusUpdate48.text=Civilians blocked the road, demanding supplies, {0}. They left us no choice - we\
  \ had to open fire. The crew executed my orders without hesitation. There''s a sense of\
  \ resignation among the team; it''s just another reminder of the harsh rules that govern this war.\
  \ Morale isn''t high, but no one expected it to be. The convoy continues at full speed. No delays\
  \ are expected.
statusUpdate49.text=Passed civilians getting water from a muddy stream, {0}. We maintained convoy\
  \ speed. There was nothing we could offer anyway, not without compromising our own supplies.\
  \ Each decision to move forward without helping weighs heavily, but operational parameters do not\
  \ allow for deviations based on sympathy. ETA to delivery holds at 17 hours, with no anticipated\
  \ delays.
statusUpdate50.text=A young boy tried to flag us down with a piece of uniform, {0}. We couldn''t slow\
  \ down, so he eventually dropped his arm and watched us pass. It''s the kind of scene that stings,\
  \ but we''ve learned to keep our eyes on the road - easier to justify when you''ve got orders to\
  \ follow. No delays expected, just a few more dents in whatever''s left of our humanity.
statusUpdate51.text=An allied unit needed a quick resupply, {0}. We''re moving again. ETA to delivery\
  \ is 17 hours.
statusUpdate52.text=Lead vehicle''s brakes failed, {0} - quick repairs got us moving again, but the\
  \ terrain remains unforgiving. It''s not just the land that wears us down; it''s the unending\
  \ struggle against obstacles, both mechanical and mental. Every fix feels temporary, like a\
  \ bandage over a wound that never truly heals. Each mile feels like a testament to perseverance,\
  \ yet the point of it all seems lost in the dust behind us. ETA is 18 hours, and the convoy moves\
  \ on, because it must.
statusUpdate53.text=Children ran alongside the convoy, hoping for handouts, {0}. We had nothing to\
  \ spare, so they eventually fell back. It''s a hard reality, but one that we''ve accepted as part\
  \ of this mission. The crew remains professional, aware that stopping could jeopardize our\
  \ schedule. Every decision here is based on efficiency, not emotion. Morale may be low, but the\
  \ convoy''s pace is steady. No delays expected.
statusUpdate54.text=Stopped by a group of allied scout ''Meks in need of resupply, {0}. They looked\
  \ rough, armor melted to slag. The crew remains alert. ETA to delivery is 18 hours.
statusUpdate55.text=Passed a makeshift hospital, {0}. Civilians lay on mats, too weak to move. We\
  \ couldn''t stop, of course. The crew knows the drill: save the rations for the ones we''re\
  \ supposed to help, not the ones already beyond it. There''s no room for sentiment in this convoy.\
  \ ETA to delivery remains 18 hours, with spirits as low as usual.
statusUpdate56.text=Near-miss with a mine due to driver fatigue, {0}. Quick reactions prevented\
  \ disaster, but it''s a reminder of the toll continuous operations take. We''re rotating drivers\
  \ more frequently to maintain sharpness. There''s some tension, but morale remains solid -\
  \ everyone knows the stakes. Banter continues on the comms, lightening the mood despite the\
  \ scare. We''re holding pace, adjusting ETA to 17 hours, and maintaining vigilance as we navigate\
  \ through the minefield.
statusUpdate57.text=Encountered a blocked pass, {0} - defensive rock formations likely placed by\
  \ enemy scouts. These barriers were effectively positioned, suggesting recon units were active\
  \ here recently. We managed to clear the path using explosives, but the delay left us exposed.\
  \ Crew remains alert, scanning for potential sniper or light ''Meks lurking nearby. We''re moving\
  \ through the pass slowly, given the likelihood of sensor mines or remote explosives. The\
  \ situation is tense, but we''ve increased sensor sweeps. Prepared to engage if enemy units\
  \ respond to our presence.
statusUpdate58.text=Civilians gathered by the roadside, {0}, hoping for handouts. We moved on\
  \ quickly, because stopping for them is about as likely as finding a peaceful solution to this\
  \ whole mess. The crew''s not thrilled, but they''ve learned that helplessness is part of the job\
  \ description. We just keep moving, like clockwork. No delays expected - just another routine day\
  \ in the logistics grind.
statusUpdate59.text=Convoy was halted by an abandoned vehicle barricade, {0}. Clearing it took\
  \ longer than expected. The blockade was a remnant of a past battle, with no immediate threats\
  \ detected. Spirits are good, with jokes about finding "souvenirs" among the wreckage. We''re\
  \ moving forward, keeping formation intact. ETA remains at 18 hours, with all systems nominal\
  \ and no expected delays.
statusUpdate60.text=Another sudden storm, {0}. The barrage of wind can damage the vehicles, so we were\
  \ forced the crew to take cover. Comms remain active, but there''s an unspoken tension - a\
  \ familiar sense of vulnerability that only adds to the weariness of war. The storm hammers the\
  \ metal with a sound that''s almost mocking, a reminder of how easily even nature can break us\
  \ down. The storm should pass soon, ETA holds at 17 hours.
statusUpdate61.text=A discrepancy in the cargo manifest required a brief halt, {0}. The issue has\
  \ been identified and resolved, but it added to the overall tension among the crew. Personnel\
  \ have been reminded of the importance of accuracy in supply management, and that errors can\

  \ from logistical errors. No further delays are expected.
statusUpdate62.text=Passed through a bombed-out market, {0}. A few civilians were scavenging among\
  \ the rubble, their faces gaunt and eyes empty. The air felt suffocating, filled with the stale\
  \ scent of smoke and decay. Spirits are low, and the reality of the situation weighs heavy on\
  \ the convoy. We''re moving forward, but it''s hard to escape the sense of futility in all this\
  \ destruction. No delays.
statusUpdate63.text=Reached an allied trench that had recently been raided, {0}. The soldiers were\
  \ still recovering, moving slowly as if the attack had stripped them of more than just\
  \ resources. We managed a quick resupply. But as we pushed forward, the lingering unease was hard\
  \ to shake - it''s the kind of feeling that settles deep, reminding us of what we''ve all lost. ETA\
  \ to delivery is 18 hours.
statusUpdate64.text=Caught a loose oil hose just in time, {0}. The damage suggests shrapnel, but\
  \ it''s unclear when it happened. The crew managed a quick patch-up, but there''s a lingering sense\
  \ that the convoy''s luck is wearing thin. Every repair feels more temporary, as if the machines\
  \ themselves are giving in to age. We''re maintaining speed, but no one is certain how long that\
  \ will last. No delays expected, but the sense of foreboding is tangible, like a storm building\
  \ in the distance.
statusUpdate65.text=GPS led us to a dead-end, {0} - an old barricade, rusted and overgrown, yet\
  \ still sturdy enough to block our path. It feels intentional, like someone wanted to trap us\
  \ here. The crew is tense, eyes darting toward the dark woods beyond, half-expecting an attack.\
  \ We''re rerouting now, trying to find a way around this obstacle, but the delay adds to the\
  \ growing anxiety. ETA is currently 18 hours, but remains uncertain.
statusUpdate66.text=Just passed some elderly civilians, {0}. They watched us pass, but there was no\
  \ movement toward us - likely a sign that they''ve lost any expectation of help. The crew didn''t\
  \ react beyond a few brief glances, understanding that this is just another facet of the war.\
  \ It''s a familiar sight, one that no longer surprises. No delays expected.
statusUpdate67.text=Signs of early heat exhaustion among drivers, {0}. Hydration protocols are in\

  \ Each moment under this scorching sun feels like another step deeper into a conflict that never\
  \ ends. ETA remains at 17 hours, but the weight of exhaustion is more evident than ever.
statusUpdate68.text={0}, convoy just left a village our forces cleared out last week. Mother and\
  \ child begged for food as we passed. The crew kept moving without hesitation. This kind of scene\
  \ has become routine - an unpleasant reality we''ve grown accustomed to. Not everyone can be\
  \ saved, and most of us have accepted that fact. Morale''s low, but it''s not unexpected. There''s\
  \ no room for sentiment here, just the necessity of pressing on toward the next checkpoint. No\
  \ delays expected.
statusUpdate69.text={0}, a sudden dust storm has descended on the convoy, cutting visibility to\
  \ almost nothing. The road we''ve been following is now obscured, swallowed by the swirling grit.\
  \ The convoy presses on. The crew is tense, scanning for signs of an ambush lurking within the\
  \ storm''s cover. We''re holding pace for now, but the sense of unseen eyes watching is relentless.
statusUpdate70.text=Reached an allied checkpoint, {0}. The weariness in the soldiers eyes was hard\
  \ to miss. They moved with purpose, though, despite the fatigue. We''re back on the move,\
  \ maintaining speed and focus. ETA to delivery holds at 18 hours.
statusUpdate71.text=Water supplies are running low faster than expected, {0}. The engine heat,\
  \ combined with evasive maneuvers, has taken a toll on hydration needs. We''ve issued tighter\
  \ rationing protocols, but the crew is managing well, joking about old desert campaigns where\
  \ water was even scarcer. Hydration is still enough for now, but reaching the next checkpoint is\
  \ crucial. No delays are expected as we maintain course.
statusUpdate72.text=Engine overheated in Transport-3, {0}. Coolant levels are critical, with\

  \ movement. Adjustments are being made to improve signal reception, but for now, we''re moving\
  \ steadily toward the next NavPoint. No delays expected.
statusUpdate98.text=Saw a line of civilians along the roadside, {0}. They waved weakly as we\
  \ approached, but we had nothing to offer. Some personnel averted their eyes, unable to meet the\
  \ gaze of the figures watching us pass. The truth is harsh: stopping could risk the mission, so\
  \ we keep moving. Morale is low, with the weight of helplessness bearing down on us. It''s hard to\
  \ ignore the misery that surrounds us, but the convoy must maintain speed. ETA to delivery\
  \ remains 17 hours.
statusUpdate99.text=Drove through a wrecked town, {0}. Civilians crowded near the road, eyes filled\
  \ with hope that we might offer aid. But we couldn''t stop - not here, not now. The crew''s\

statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming7.text={0}, moving at full speed, barely holding\
  \ formation as LRMs rain down. Crews are pushing hard, keeping vehicles\
  \ on the road under heavy fire. The situation remains critical.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming8.text={0}, overwhelming enemy pressure forced\
  \ abandonment of resupply attempts. Initial engagement involved concentrated\
  \ artillery and missile fire, rapidly escalating to a full-scale assault on the checkpoint.\
  \ Supplies were left behind to maintain speed and maneuverability. Movement\
  \ continues toward secondary navpoints.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming9.text={0}, enemy launched an ambush at the\
  \ river crossing, using entrenched positions to disrupt movement. Dug-in\
  \ troops provided cover for their forward units, limiting convoy progress.\
  \ Convoy units maintained defensive positions, but forward movement was\
  \ significantly slowed. All systems remain operational, but enemy presence is\
  \ effectively blocking the route.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming10.text={0}, coordinated attacks drove the convoy\
  \ back from the supply depot. Enemy forces unleashed a rapid assault with heavy\
  \ laser fire, scorching the surrounding terrain. Defensive fire was returned,\
  \ but the intensity forced a quick withdrawal.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming11.text={0}, retreating without pause under continuous\
  \ artillery bombardment. We''re keeping our heads down and pushing forward\
  \ despite heavy impacts. The mission continues, but each moment feels like it\
  \ could be our last.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming12.text={0}, we watched as the resupply depot\
  \ got hit hard. Explosions ripped through its defenses as\
  \ enemy forces broke through, turning it into a scene of utter devastation.\
  \ Fire and smoke filled the air, masking our withdrawal. The convoy continues its\
  \ advance, but the cost has been high, with allied support largely compromised.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming13.text={0}, the enemy''s relentless pressure nearly\
  \ broke the convoy''s resolve near the river crossing. Sustained autocannon fire\
  \ forced rapid evasive action. Convoy continues to advance, but the way forward is uncertain.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming14.text={0}, narrowly escaped a well-laid ambush.\

  \ We''re heads-down and pedal to the metal here!
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming16.text={0}, convoy''s route in this sector was\
  \ nearly overrun during the enemy''s final push. Enemy units pressed hard, breaking\
  \ through defensive lines with heavy firepower. Drivers struggled to hold\
  \ formation amid chaotic conditions, executing rapid evasive maneuvers to prevent\
  \ full encirclement. Enemy presence remains significant,\
  \ suggesting possible follow-up attacks. Crews are maintaining focus, with defensive\
  \ measures active.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming17.text={0}, attempted to regroup in this sector,\
  \ but overwhelming enemy firepower forced a rapid retreat. Artillery shells rained\
  \ down, creating craters and debris that blocked potential escape routes. Crews\
  \ struggled to maintain formation as enemy ''Meks pressed hard, their cannons and\

  \ ready to respond to further attacks.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming18.text={0}, convoy hit hard at a narrow pass.\
  \ Enemy fire was intense, targeting key vehicles and breaking formation briefly.\
  \ Morale among crews is declining due to sustained pressure. Defensive measures\
  \ are holding. Movement is slow, with evasive tactics in use to prevent losses.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming19.text={0}, pressing through rocky terrain, aiming\

statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming24.text={0}, convoy remains operational despite heavy\
  \ skirmisher pressure. We''re doing our best, but every moment counts.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming25.text={0}, faced a devastating ambush at the river\
  \ crossing. Heavy fire hit the flanks hard, forcing rapid evasive action. Crews\
  \ maintained defensive formations, but the intensity of the assault caused\
  \ significant disruption. We''re still enroute, but it''s touch and go here.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming26.text={0}, the convoy is intact but was nearly crippled by\

  \ enemy fire. We''ve still got everyone, but it''s tough going.\
  \ Progress is slower than expected, but the convoy remains intact.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming29.text={0}, maintaining formation under heavy fire is\
  \ proving difficult. Enemy units are probing the perimeter, forcing rapid\
  \ defensive shifts.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming30.text={0}, situation is critical; defensive positions\
  \ must be re-established immediately in this sector. The enemy is everywhere,\
  \ and while we''ve remained unnoticed for now, that won''t last.\
  \ I don''t know what the situation is like at your end, but it''s a real\
  \ rat''s nest here!
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming31.text={0}, convoy''s position in this sector was\
  \ nearly overrun during the latest push. Assault ''Meks broke through\
  \ defensive lines, forcing crews to make split-second decisions under intense\
  \ pressure. Vehicles maneuvered desperately, dodging autocannon bursts and PPC\
  \ volleys, and we were able to break free at the last moment.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming32.text={0}, held position at the checkpoint initially,\
  \ but enemy LRMs launched while we were refueling. Forced withdrawal was the only\
  \ option.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming33.text={0}, attempted to regroup in this sector, but\

  \ concentrated autocannon bursts, forcing another rapid retreat. Enemy units\
  \ maintain a strong foothold, leaving limited options for immediate re-engagement.\
  \ Convoy continues to retreat toward secondary routes.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming34.text={0}, despite relentless pressure, the convoy\
  \ continues forward. Enemy fire is concentrated, targeting key vehicles in an\
  \ attempt to disrupt formation. Crews maintain defensive posture, responding\
  \ promptly to incoming attacks. Morale is under strain, but the mission remains\
  \ the top priority. No halts possible.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming35.text={0}, retreating to a safer position under\
  \ sustained fire. Enemy pressure is intense, forcing rapid withdrawals while\
  \ maintaining tight formation. Crews are managing vehicle integrity despite the\
  \ barrage. We''re currently regrouping, stabilizing our position before the next\
  \ move forward.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming36.text={0}, the convoy is barely moving, pinned down\
  \ by relentless PPC fire from entrenched enemy positions. Crews are working frantically,\
  \ trying to keep engines running and maintain any semblance of formation. The odds\
  \ are heavily stacked against us, but we''re going to make a break for it.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming37.text={0}, retreating at full speed. Enemy ''Meks,\
  \ including heavies and fast scouts, are closing quickly. PPC blasts and missile trails\
  \ are coming at us. We''re pushing the vehicles to their absolute limits,\
  \ fighting to maintain control over rough terrain. There''s no time to regroup or\
  \ assess damages; it''s a desperate race to create distance from relentless pursuit.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming38.text={0}, convoy remains intact. Enemy fire from\
  \ elevated positions is increasing rapidly. Progress is slow but steady.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming39.text={0}, taking detours to bypass enemy-controlled zones.\
  \ Enemy units are harassing us from multiple directions,\
  \ and we''re struggling to keep moving.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming40.text={0}, we''re pulling back, no time to\
  \ regroup. Enemy pressure remains high, with advancing ''Meks closing in rapidly.\
  \ Convoy speed is critical, with evasive tactics prioritized to maintain distance.\
  \ Situation remains unstable, but the convoy is still together.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming41.text={0}, enemy''s relentless assault at the river\
  \ crossing nearly broke our formation. Heavy fire targeted the front and rear\
  \ elements, forcing rapid adjustments.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming42.text={0}, drivers are pushing hard, doing their best\
  \ to maintain movement. LRMs and autocannon fire create constant hazards, making\
  \ every moment a struggle. We''re doing what we can.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming43.text={0}, the convoy was nearly overrun just moments ago.\
  \ Enemy forces launched a coordinated assault, closing in rapidly from multiple directions.\
  \ Defensive measures were stretched to their limits, but crews managed to repel\
  \ the initial wave. Convoy remains intact, pushing forward under heavy fire.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming44.text={0}, the convoy narrowly escaped a massive\
  \ assault. Initial contact involved heavy SRM fire, forcing evasive maneuvers.\
  \ Enemy ''Meks, primarily heavies, attempted encirclement but failed due to a\
  \ rapid breakout. Enemy forces are regrouping, but convoy continues\
  \ to advance toward safer ground.
statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming45.text=[Heavy static is audible, punctuated with\

# getCacheDescriptionDud
dudGeneric0.text={0}, we''ve scoured the valley below {0} for hours now. The canyon walls are steep,\
  \ littered with fallen debris and old scorch marks - possibly from a {0} skirmish long before our time.\
  \ Low visibility''s a problem; dense fog keeps sensors from getting clean reads. We picked up faint\
  \ energy spikes three times, but each time it flickered out, almost as if it''s designed to lure us\
  \ deeper. I''ve got a bad feeling about this place. The team''s morale is dipping; some swear they\
  \ saw movement in the shadows, but I''ve found no tracks or heat signatures. Continuing the sweep,\
  \ but so far, no sign of the {0} depot.
dudGeneric1.text={0}, we''re in the eastern ridgeline now, along the edge of {0}. Rain is coming down hard,\
  \ turning the ground into mud and gumming up our treads. Signal interference is off the charts -\
  \ comms are breaking up, and sensors are giving ghost returns, as if something from the {0}\
  \ is jamming us. The depot''s supposed coordinates have been checked twice, but all we''ve found are\
  \ old bunkers, stripped bare. I''m not sure if we''re missing something or if the intel''s bad,\
  \ but nothing here feels right. We''ll push a little further before pulling back to base.
dudGeneric2.text={0}, we''re at the foothills in {0}, and this place is like a graveyard. Twisted metal and\
  \ wreckage from old {0} ''Meks litter the ground, half-buried in snowdrifts. There''s a chill in the\
  \ air that''s not just the cold - the men are restless. Sensors keep pinging with minor seismic\
  \ tremors, but no sign of structures beneath the surface. I ordered a manual check, but all\
  \ we''re digging up are shattered armor plates and frozen corpses. We''re running low on supplies,\
  \ but I''ll give it one more pass before retreating. The depot remains elusive.
dudGeneric3.text={0}, we''ve reached the marshlands near {0}. The terrain''s worse than expected;\
  \ it''s a mire of sucking mud and stagnant pools, hard on the legs and the ''Meks'' joints. Visibility\
  \ is near-zero - constant mist and roiling fog make thermal scans unreliable. We picked up what\
  \ might have been a burst transmission earlier, but it cut out before we could trace it back to a\
  \ possible source. The team is growing wary; strange sounds are coming from deeper in the swamp,\
  \ but no visual or sensor confirmation. It could be wildlife... or something else. No sign of the {0}\
  \ cache yet.
dudGeneric4.text={0}, we''ve crossed the plateau and are closing in on the last set of coordinates in {0}.\
  \ The high winds up here are tearing at our comms, and static is becoming a constant companion.\
  \ I''ve seen strange lights on the horizon - some kind of electrical discharge, maybe from old tech,\
  \ but the sensors can''t make heads or tails of it. We''ve found more abandoned gear, some bearing\
  \ faint {0} insignia, but no sign of anything functional. Morale is low, and the crew''s starting to\
  \ think this depot might be nothing more than a rumor. Requesting permission to withdraw soon.
dudGeneric5.text={0}, we''re moving through the deep woods in {0}. Thick underbrush is slowing\
  \ our advance, and sensors are picking up strange heat anomalies, but they vanish just as quickly\
  \ as they appear. We found remnants of a resupply - old crates, half-buried in moss - but no\
  \ signs of anything more significant. The atmosphere here is heavy, and some of the crew report\
  \ hearing distorted voices over the comms, but no clear signals from a {0} frequency. Still no sight\
  \ of the depot.
dudGeneric6.text={0}, we''ve reached the desert flats near {0}. Sandstorms are fierce, creating\
  \ interference across all sensor bands. We''ve come across what looks like the ruins of a {0} outpost,\
  \ walls partially buried in dunes, but no clear leads on the depot''s location. The wind carries\
  \ a strange whistling sound, almost like a distant scream, but no signatures detected. The team\
  \ is growing weary; supplies are running thin, but we''ll press on a bit longer.
dudGeneric7.text={0}, we''ve pushed into the rocky canyons near {0}. The cliffs are steep, and\
  \ strange markings along the rock face hint at a possible local presence. However, every cave we''ve\
  \ searched so far has been empty, save for a few damaged scout cars with {0} insignia. Scans suggest\
  \ faint energy trails deeper in, but they''re erratic, almost like decoys. It''s as if the depot\
  \ was never here - or has been moved elsewhere entirely.
dudGeneric8.text={0}, the swamp here in {0} is a nightmare. Deep, murky waters make it nearly\
  \ impossible to maneuver, and sensors are plagued by thick bio-signatures. We found a rusted {0}\
  \ DropShip hull partially submerged, but it''s long dead. No signs of recent activity, no depot.\
  \ Strange lights dance across the surface of the water, but readings suggest they''re natural\
  \ phenomena. The crew''s resolve is wavering.
dudGeneric9.text={0}, we''re in the abandoned urban sector at {0}. These ruins bear {0} \
  \ markings, likely from the last conflict here. Most buildings are gutted, with walls blackened by\
  \ fires. We found a few leftover data terminals, but they''re too damaged to provide intel on the\
  \ depot. Sporadic sensor pings suggest faint power sources, but they''re too weak to be the target.\
  \ We''ll continue the sweep.
dudGeneric10.text={0}, we''ve arrived at the ice fields near {0}. Blizzards are brutal, and the\
  \ cold is affecting our equipment. We found a partially collapsed {0} bunker under the ice, but it''s\
  \ been abandoned for years. A few sensor ghosts suggested movement beneath the ice sheets, but we\
  \ can''t confirm if it''s related to the depot. The search is feeling more futile with every passing\
  \ hour.
dudGeneric11.text={0}, we''ve entered the gorge in {0}. It''s dark and narrow, with jagged rocks\
  \ making navigation difficult. The echoes here play tricks on the sensors - everything feels off.\
  \ We located a rusted {0} APC, but it''s been stripped clean. Still no sign of the depot, just a lot\
  \ of eerie silence. Morale is dipping, but we''ll keep moving.
dudGeneric12.text={0}, we''re in the dense fog zone around {0}. Visibility is nearly zero, and\
  \ our thermal scans are useless. There are remnants of a communication array here, but it''s been\
  \ inactive for ages. We attempted a few broadcasts on {0} frequencies, hoping for a response, but\
  \ nothing came back. The depot''s location remains elusive.
dudGeneric13.text={0}, we''ve reached the river crossing at {0}. The water is fast and deep, with\
  \ fallen {0} equipment littering the banks. We tried scanning for possible underwater installations,\
  \ but the currents make it too risky for a deeper search. No depot detected. The crew is exhausted,\
  \ and the constant roar of the river is fraying nerves.
dudGeneric14.text={0}, we''re combing through the craters at {0}. The ground is pockmarked from past\
  \ bombardments, making traversal treacherous. We found a cache of old {0} munitions, but they''re\
  \ degraded beyond use. No power sources, no shelter, and certainly no depot. It''s starting to feel\
  \ like a wild goose chase, but we''ll give it one last push before calling it off.
dudGeneric15.text={0}, we''re at the edge of the wasteland in {0}. The ground here is blackened,\
  \ possibly from an earlier scorched-earth tactic. Radiation spikes occasionally flare up, throwing\
  \ off our sensors. We found scattered remains of {0} recon vehicles, but the depot itself is nowhere\
  \ to be found. The deeper we go, the more desolate it becomes.
dudGeneric16.text={0}, we''ve entered a cavern network at {0}. It''s a twisting maze down here, full\
  \ of stale air and lingering darkness. We found a few {0} insignias etched into the rock, but no signs\
  \ of recent activity. Sensors keep picking up false positives, likely echoes from the rocks. No depot,\
  \ no progress.
dudGeneric17.text={0}, we''re deep in the ravine at {0}. The ground is unstable, and minor landslides\
  \ have slowed us down. We found an old {0} MekBay, buried under debris, but it''s been picked clean.\
  \ No signs of life, no depot, and only the occasional creak of shifting rocks to accompany us. We''re\
  \ preparing to exit the area.
dudGeneric18.text={0}, we''re scanning the old mining site at {0}. Rusted machinery and broken {0}\
  \ loaders dot the landscape, but the depot remains elusive. The tunnels are partially collapsed,\
  \ making it too risky to venture deeper. We''ll mark this location as a potential future salvage site,\
  \ but as for the {0} depot, there''s no trace of it here.
dudGeneric19.text={0}, we''ve reached the frozen ridge at {0}. Snow drifts are high, and visibility\
  \ is minimal. We detected what appeared to be a {0} signal burst, but it was gone before we could\
  \ triangulate its source. No depot, just more barren snowfields. The team is growing weary, and\
  \ supplies are dwindling. Requesting permission to retreat.
dudGeneric20.text={0}, we''re backtracking through {0}. The ground is scarred by ancient shell\
  \ craters, now filled with stagnant pools of water. It''s strange - seeing the relics of battles\
  \ fought long ago, with no one left to remember what it was even for. The {0} depot, if it ever existed,\
  \ is lost to time, much like the warriors who once bled for it. I fear we''re searching for ghosts.
dudGeneric21.text={0}, we''ve reached the abandoned fortress at {0}. {0} emblems still adorn the\
  \ crumbling walls, faded and weathered by time. It feels more like a mausoleum than a depot now.\
  \ The corridors echo with emptiness, reminding us of those who must have once called this home. No\
  \ sign of life or supplies - only dust and the lingering sorrow of battles lost.
dudGeneric22.text={0}, we''re in the overgrown ruins at {0}. Nature has reclaimed the old outpost\
  \ here, vines wrapping around shattered gun emplacements and shattered buildings. We found rusted\
  \ ammo crates with {0} insignia, untouched for decades. It''s like searching through the remains of\
  \ a forgotten dream. I wonder if anyone even remembers why we''re still looking.
dudGeneric23.text={0}, we''ve combed through the wasteland at {0}. The ground is cracked and barren,\
  \ scorched by a {0} retreat that left nothing but ash. It''s as if the land itself is trying to forget\
  \ what happened here. The depot is nowhere to be found, and the crew can''t shake the feeling that\
  \ our efforts mean little in the grand scheme of endless war.
dudGeneric24.text={0}, we''ve reached the mountain pass in {0}. Snow covers the remnants of a {0}\
  \ base, the white blanket making everything feel eerily peaceful, despite the chaos that must have\
  \ raged here once. No depot, only shattered bunkers and the hollow remnants of a cause that seems\
  \ distant now, even as we pursue it.
dudGeneric25.text={0}, we''re in the canyon at {0}. Faded {0} banners still hang from some of the\
  \ rocky outcroppings, flapping gently in the wind. We found a few empty crates and a rusted comm\
  \ relay, both long since abandoned. It''s clear that whatever purpose this depot once served has\
  \ been abandoned, much like the ideals that built it.
dudGeneric26.text={0}, we''ve reached the outskirts of an old {0} encampment at {0}. Everything here\
  \ feels forgotten, like a chapter left unfinished in a book no one reads anymore. There''s no depot,\
  \ only the scattered remains of tents and supply crates. Sometimes I wonder if our search is driven\
  \ more by stubbornness than reason.
dudGeneric27.text={0}, we''re deep in the forest at {0}. The trees are thick, their branches heavy\
  \ with a quiet sadness, as if they''ve seen too much. We found a rusted {0} Scout VTOL, fallen among\
  \ the roots. No sign of the depot, just the faint memory of battles that seemed important once,\
  \ but now feel pointless.
dudGeneric28.text={0}, we''re navigating the swamps of {0}. This place is a graveyard of old {0}\
  \ vehicles, slowly being consumed by the mud. It''s hard to say if this depot was ever real, or\
  \ just another mirage in a war full of them. The men seem tired, not just from the search, but from\
  \ the futility of finding meaning in any of this.
dudGeneric29.text={0}, we''ve arrived at the abandoned {0} airfield in {0}. The runways are cracked,\
  \ and the hangars are empty. It''s a scene of a past defeat, frozen in time. We found nothing but\
  \ broken Meks and hollow shells. No depot, just the echoes of strategies that failed and lives that\
  \ were lost chasing glory.
dudGeneric30.text={0}, we''ve entered the trench network at {0}. These {0} trenches are deep, filled\
  \ with rusted weapons and faded uniforms, but no depot. The mud here is heavy, as if it''s trying to\
  \ pull us down into the past with every step. It''s hard not to feel like we''re just retracing old\
  \ failures, destined to repeat them.
dudGeneric31.text={0}, we''re among the ruins of a city in {0}. The buildings are skeletal,\
  \ shadows of a once-thriving population now reduced to rubble. No {0} depot, only the sadness of a city\
  \ that dreamed of prosperity but fell under the weight of war. We''re finding nothing of value here,\
  \ only a lingering sense of loss.
dudGeneric32.text={0}, we''ve reached the fields of {0}. It''s a plain covered in overgrown grass\
  \ and rusting {0} weapon emplacements. There''s a haunting calm here, as if even nature has grown\
  \ tired of conflict. No sign of the depot, just remnants of another battle that history has all\
  \ but forgotten.
dudGeneric33.text={0}, we''ve arrived at the edge of a {0} battlefield at {0}. Scorched Meks and\
  \ shattered tanks are all that remain, their wreckage a testament to how quickly war can erase\
  \ everything. No depot in sight, just a grim reminder of how futile it all seems when the metal\
  \ stops moving.
dudGeneric34.text={0}, we''ve reached the lakeshore at {0}. The water is still, reflecting the\
  \ gray sky above. We found a few {0} ration crates near the bank, but they''re long expired, much\
  \ like the hopes that once fueled this depot''s creation. We''re not finding anything of use, just\
  \ reminders of a war that seems determined to outlast us all.
dudGeneric35.text={0}, we''re at the border of the {0} encampment in {0}. The camp is deserted, its\
  \ tents torn and its fires cold. I can''t help but feel a deep sadness as we sift through the remnants\
  \ - once part of a grand strategy, now just meaningless fragments. No depot, only shadows of what was.
dudGeneric36.text={0}, we''ve reached the foothills of Sector 29-R. The landscape here is scarred by {0}\
  \ artillery strikes, and the air is thick with melancholy. We found an old command post, but it''s\
  \ stripped bare, like the hollow remains of hope itself. No sign of the depot, just the sense that\
  \ we''re chasing something that''s long since slipped away.
dudGeneric37.text={0}, we''re moving through the plains at {0}. We came across a {0} outpost, little\
  \ more than ruins now. The wind carries a sad, empty sound, as if the land itself is mourning what\
  \ was lost here. No depot, just more evidence futility of this endless conflict.
dudGeneric38.text={0}, we''re in the desert at {0}. The ground is hard, and the air is heavy with\
  \ the weight of old battles. We found rusted {0} Meks buried in the sand, their pilots long gone.\
  \ The depot is nowhere to be found - only silence and the feeling that every step forward is a step\
  \ deeper into the past.
dudGeneric39.text={0}, we''ve reached the ruins of a {0} HQ at {0}. The walls are covered in bullet\
  \ holes, and the floor is littered with spent casings. It''s as if time itself has moved on, leaving\
  \ this place behind. No depot here, just the quiet futility of trying to hold on to something that\
  \ war has already claimed.
dudGeneric40.text={0}, we''re back at {0}, scanning for the fifth time. There''s nothing but sand\
  \ and rocks - again. No sign of a {0} depot, just the same dusty horizon we''ve been staring at for\
  \ hours. The crew''s getting restless, and honestly, so am I. It''s hard to keep pushing when it feels\
  \ like we''re chasing our own shadows.
dudGeneric41.text={0}, we''ve entered the marshlands around {0}. The mud is thick, the humidity\
  \ is unbearable, and we haven''t found so much as a single {0} crate. Sensors keep glitching, but\
  \ we''re almost certain it''s just the local wildlife messing with the readings. The men are\
  \ complaining about everything - from the mosquitoes to the mission itself. I can''t blame them.
dudGeneric42.text={0}, we''re trudging through the forest at {0}. Every step feels the same -\
  \ trees, mud, more trees. We found an old {0} sensor tower, but it''s useless now, just like the\
  \ past eight hours of searching. The crew is barely responding to orders; it''s like their minds\
  \ are already back at base.
dudGeneric43.text={0}, we''re in {0}, checking yet another empty canyon. No {0} signals, no depot,\
  \ no point. I don''t know what the intel team was thinking sending us here. This place is just\
  \ another dead end, and we''re starting to wonder if the depot even exists.
dudGeneric44.text={0}, we''re skirting the edge of an old battlefield at {0}. Just more {0} wreckage,\
  \ more silence, and more of the same stale air. No depot in sight, not even a hint of recent activity.\
  \ Morale is as low as I''ve ever seen it; half the team isn''t even pretending to look anymore.
dudGeneric45.text={0}, we''ve reached the plains at {0}. It''s flat, empty, and utterly\
  \ unremarkable. We found some {0} equipment scattered around, but it''s just rusted junk -\
  \ nothing worth hauling back. I think we''ve reached the point where everyone''s just going through\
  \ the motions.
dudGeneric46.text={0}, we''re at the river in {0}. It''s too wide to cross, and the water looks as\
  \ brown as our chances of finding anything {0}-related here. We''ve been staring at our maps for\
  \ hours, but every potential lead just seems to be another wild goose chase. No depot, just a\
  \ bunch of wet boots and wasted time.
dudGeneric47.text={0}, we''re stuck in {0}, waiting for the fog to clear. We''ve been sitting here\
  \ so long that the crew has started playing cards just to pass the time. No signals, no {0} depot,\
  \ just the same old haze. I think some of the team are starting to wonder why we''re even bothering.
dudGeneric48.text={0}, we''re combing through the hills at {0}. Nothing but rocks and more rocks.\
  \ We found a half-buried {0} vehicle, but it''s been picked clean - just like every other so-called\
  \ lead. The crew''s too frustrated to even argue about it anymore; they just shrug and move on.
dudGeneric49.text={0}, we''ve entered the swamp at {0}. It''s all mud and stale water, and our\
  \ sensors are useless here. The {0} depot was supposed to be nearby, but I''m starting to think\
  \ this whole mission is just someone''s idea of a cruel joke. Morale is at rock bottom.
dudGeneric50.text={0}, we''re trudging through {0} again. This is our third sweep, and we''ve\
  \ found exactly nothing {0}-related - unless you count a few rusted ammo casings. The men are\
  \ grumbling constantly, and frankly, I''m just as tired of this as they are. It feels like a waste\
  \ of time.
dudGeneric51.text={0}, we''re back at {0}. There''s no sign of a {0} depot, not even a false-positive\
  \ on the sensors. I think the crew are starting to doubt the existence of this depot entirely.\
  \ They''re moving slower with each passing hour, as if the weight of futility is sinking in.
dudGeneric52.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an old {0} outpost at {0}. It''s just more of the\
  \ same - empty shells, rusted parts, and nothing of value. The crew''s too bored to even feign\
  \ interest at this point. I''m not sure how much longer we can keep up this charade.
dudGeneric53.text={0}, we''re in the desert of {0}. It''s hot, dry, and utterly devoid of anything\
  \ useful. We''ve searched every likely spot for a {0} depot, but it''s just sand, sand, and more sand.\
  \ The team''s growing tired of my orders, and I can''t say I blame them.
dudGeneric54.text={0}, we''re at the cliffs in {0}. The terrain is rough, but what''s rougher is\
  \ the lack of results. We''ve been looking for this {0} depot for hours, and all we''ve got to show for\
  \ it is a few bruised egos. Morale is dragging, and so is this mission.
dudGeneric55.text={0}, we''ve reached {0}. There''s nothing here - just more empty plains and more\
  \ disappointment. The crew isn''t even trying to hide their frustration anymore. This {0} depot, if\
  \ it ever existed, must be laughing at us from the shadows.
dudGeneric56.text={0}, we''re checking the caves at {0}. These {0} tunnels are as empty as our\
  \ hopes of finding anything useful. The crew''s getting sick of crawling through the dirt for no\
  \ reason. At this point, I think even I''d settle for a solid lead on a canteen.
dudGeneric57.text={0}, we''ve reached the abandoned {0} camp at {0}. It''s the same story as always\
  \ - empty crates, broken weapons, and nothing else. The men have stopped asking questions; they\
  \ just keep moving with a blank look in their eyes. I think this mission is breaking us slowly.
dudGeneric58.text={0}, we''re back at the ridge in {0}. The view''s nice, but that''s about it. No\
  \ depot, no {0} signals, just another false lead in a series of false leads. I think I''ve seen this\
  \ ridge so many times, I could draw it from memory. The crew isn''t even pretending to care anymore.
dudGeneric59.text={0}, we''re in the marshes of {0}. We''ve slogged through knee-deep mud for hours\
  \ with nothing to show for it. The {0} depot is still just a rumor, and the crew''s patience ran out\
  \ three grids ago. At this point, it feels like the mud is dragging us down more than the mission.
dudGeneric60.text={0}, we''re back at {0}, staring at the same rocks we saw earlier. I''m starting\
  \ to think these {0} folks buried their depot in a parallel dimension. I''ll check under one more\
  \ suspicious-looking pebble before we move on. Spirits are surprisingly high, though; I think the\
  \ crew''s betting on who''ll find the most useless piece of scrap today.
dudGeneric61.text={0}, we''ve hit the swamp at {0}. The mud here is so thick, I think it''s trying\
  \ to steal our boots. No {0} depot yet, but we did find a very angry-looking toad. The crew named\
  \ it "General Sludge," and it''s currently our most promising lead. Morale''s good - though I think\
  \ they like the challenge of the swamp more than the mission.
dudGeneric62.text={0}, we''re in the forest at {0}. It''s so dense that the trees must have grown to\
  \ hide something, right? So far, no luck on the {0} depot, but we did find a tree with some suspicious\
  \ bark. The crew''s decided to start a "Most Bizarre Discovery" contest, and the current leader is\
  \ a rock that vaguely resembles a ''Mek pilot flipping us off.
dudGeneric63.text={0}, we''re in {0}, still searching for that mythical {0} depot. All we''ve found\
  \ is an ancient can of rations. The label reads "Best Before 2550," but Private Randall says\
  \ he''s willing to give it a try if we get desperate. Spirits are weirdly high; it seems the absurdity\
  \ of it all is keeping everyone entertained.
dudGeneric64.text={0}, we''re at {0}, and it''s official - this is the most boring stretch of land\
  \ in the Inner Sphere. No depot, no {0} activity, just miles of nothing. The crew''s taken to naming\
  \ the rocks we pass. We''ve got "Old Grumpy," "The Jagged Lady," and "Sir Pebbleton III" so far. At\
  \ least they''re keeping busy.
dudGeneric65.text={0}, we''ve reached {0}. We haven''t found a {0} depot, but we did find a very\
  \ determined squirrel trying to break into one of our ration packs. I think it might be our most\
  \ formidable opponent yet. The crew''s morale is good - turns out, nothing bonds a team like trying\
  \ to outsmart wildlife.
dudGeneric66.text={0}, we''re at the river in {0}. Still no {0} depot, but we did manage to have a\
  \ nice little "who can skim the most rocks" competition. The winner got to wear an improvised crown\
  \ made from twigs. If only {0} tech was as easy to find as things to make fun of.
dudGeneric67.text={0}, we''re stuck in {0} again. The fog''s so thick that I think I just tried to\
  \ have a conversation with a tree. We''re laughing about it, though - it''s not every day you mistake\
  \ a pine for your comms officer. Still no {0} depot, unless it''s disguised as a very stealthy squirrel.
dudGeneric68.text={0}, we''re at the hills in {0}. The only {0}-related thing we''ve found is an\
  \ old helmet with a dent so big it could serve as a soup bowl. The crew''s making jokes about how\
  \ the depot''s probably cloaked with "super-stealth tech," a.k.a. "just plain missing."
dudGeneric69.text={0}, we''ve entered the swamp at {0}. It''s like nature''s version of a bad\
  \ joke: every step is squishy, and every scan is a false alarm. No {0} depot, but we did discover\
  \ that we have an impressive talent for swamp-related limericks. Spirits are oddly high,\
  \ probably because it''s impossible to be sad while rhyming ''slog'' with ''bog.''
dudGeneric70.text={0}, we''re back at {0}. I think I saw the same bush three times today - it''s\
  \ either following us, or we''re lost. No {0} depot yet, but we think we''ve found "the meaning\
  \ of life" in the shape of a weirdly shaped tree root. Morale''s still solid - probably because\
  \ we''ve all lost our minds a little bit.
dudGeneric71.text={0}, we''re in the ruins at {0}. Found some old {0} propaganda posters that are\
  \ now being repurposed as a dartboard. No depot, but the crew''s having a good laugh at the slogans\
  \ - turns out "Victory Through Perseverance" is ironically hilarious when you''re lost in the middle\
  \ of nowhere.
dudGeneric72.text={0}, we''re at {0} in the desert. It''s so hot here that we''ve taken to telling\
  \ "dry" jokes. You know the type: "Why don''t {0} depots like the desert? Because they''re afraid of\
  \ being found." Spirits are surprisingly up, mostly thanks to our terrible sense of humor.
dudGeneric73.text={0}, we''re at the cliffs in {0}. It''s rocky, dangerous, and completely devoid\
  \ of anything remotely {0}-related. On the bright side, the crew discovered that yelling "Echo!"\
  \ off the cliffs is an excellent way to pass the time. No depot, but plenty of echoes to keep us\
  \ entertained.
dudGeneric74.text={0}, we''ve reached {0}. This empty plain has become our least favorite spot,\
  \ but we did manage to build a pretty impressive sandcastle in the downtime. The crew''s named it\
  \ "Fort {0}," in honor of the depot we''ll never find. Morale''s surprisingly high - who knew building\
  \ sandcastles was so therapeutic?
dudGeneric75.text={0}, we''re in the tunnels at {0}. Found some {0} graffiti that reads "Kilroy Was\
  \ Here." No depot, but it''s nice to know we''re not the first to get stuck in this mess. The crew''s\
  \ taken to singing campfire songs, even without a fire. Gallows humor is the only thing keeping us\
  \ sane.
dudGeneric76.text={0}, we''re at the {0} camp ruins in {0}. There''s nothing here but busted tents\
  \ and empty cans, but the crew''s decided to reenact a dramatic play about "The Depot That Never\
  \ Was." If you hear loud applause over the comms, don''t be alarmed - it''s just the sound of our\
  \ own despair.
dudGeneric77.text={0}, we''re at the ridge in {0}. I''m starting to think this whole {0} depot\
  \ hunt is a cosmic joke, and we''re the punchline. The crew''s betting on who can find the most\
  \ absurd object out here. So far, the front-runner is a rock shaped like a duck. Spirits are still\
  \ high, probably due to the absurdity of it all.
dudGeneric78.text={0}, we''re back in the marshes of {0}. The mud here is trying to steal our sanity,\
  \ one boot at a time. Still no {0} depot, but we did manage to build a raft from some fallen branches.\
  \ We''re calling it the "WarShip Lost Cause." Morale remains shockingly good, considering the circumstances.
dudGeneric79.text={0}, we''re in the ice fields at {0}. We found nothing {0}-related, but the crew\
  \ did discover that sliding down icy slopes is a surprisingly fun way to kill time. No depot, but\
  \ plenty of laughter. I suppose if we''re going to be lost, we might as well enjoy the ride.
dudGeneric80.text={0}, we''re deep in {0}, surrounded by fog so thick it feels like it''s alive.\
  \ The sensors keep flickering - false signals that seem to move closer, then vanish. No sign of the\
  \ {0} depot, but I can''t shake the feeling we''re being watched. The crew is jumpy; even the slightest\
  \ sound is making us reach for weapons.
dudGeneric81.text={0}, we''re in the marshlands of {0}. Strange lights hover just beyond our\
  \ vision - flickering, almost playful, but gone the moment we try to focus. No {0} depot, only a\
  \ growing sense of unease. It''s not just the swamp; it''s like the air itself is charged with\
  \ something hostile, something old.
dudGeneric82.text={0}, we''ve reached the forest in {0}. The trees here are unnaturally silent\
  \ - no wind, no birds, not even the rustle of leaves. We found a rusted {0} ''Mek half-buried in\
  \ the ground, its cockpit open and empty. The crew swears they heard whispers coming from inside,\
  \ but the scanners showed nothing.
dudGeneric83.text={0}, we''re at {0}, exploring what seems to be a forgotten {0} bunker. The walls\
  \ are covered in strange, indecipherable marks, as if scratched by claws. We detected faint heat\
  \ signatures earlier, but they disappeared without a trace. The men are scared - some say they''ve\
  \ seen shadows that move when no one else does.
dudGeneric84.text={0}, we''re back at {0}. We found a clearing littered with {0} remains - helmets,\
  \ scattered bones, and rusted weapons. The strange thing is, there''s no record of a battle here. No\
  \ depot, but an unsettling feeling that we''re standing in a place where something awful happened,\
  \ something not recorded in the history books.
dudGeneric85.text={0}, we''re in the plains of {0}. There''s a strange hum in the air - low,\
  \ constant, and impossible to trace. It''s unsettling, like the sound is coming from the ground\
  \ itself. No sign of a {0} depot, but the crew''s starting to act strangely. Some are whispering to\
  \ themselves, claiming they hear voices beneath the hum.
dudGeneric86.text={0}, we''re at the river in {0}. The water''s surface is black and still, reflecting\
  \ only darkness. We saw strange ripples earlier, like something large moving beneath, but no signs\
  \ of life or {0} tech. The crew is spooked - one of the men claims he saw eyes staring up from the\
  \ depths, but they were gone in an instant.
dudGeneric87.text={0}, we''re stuck in {0}, waiting for the fog to lift. But this isn''t normal fog\
  \ - it''s cold, dense, and seems to pulse as if breathing. No {0} depot, just a chilling sense that\
  \ something here doesn''t want us to leave. Even the comms are full of static, but every now and\
  \ then, there''s a faint voice in the interference.
dudGeneric88.text={0}, we''re in the hills of {0}. We came across a {0} campsite that looks recent,\
  \ but scans indicate it''s been abandoned for decades. There''s dried blood on the ground, but no bodies.\
  \ The men are nervous, saying it feels like we''ve stepped into a place trapped between times.
dudGeneric89.text={0}, we''re in the swamp at {0}. There''s an eerie stillness here, like the world\
  \ is holding its breath. Strange shapes drift in and out of the mist, but disappear when we approach.\
  \ No {0} depot, just an overwhelming sense that we''re trespassing somewhere we shouldn''t be.
dudGeneric90.text={0}, we''re pushing through {0}, and the fog here is unnaturally dense,\
  \ almost suffocating. Sensors are erratic, picking up strange energy spikes - like a signature, then\
  \ gone. No sign of the {0} depot, but there''s been talk among the crew about a shape in the mist.\
  \ They say it looked like a Marauder, pitch-black, watching from the edge of visibility before\
  \ vanishing into the haze. The men are spooked. Even the air feels colder, like a warning. We''re\
  \ staying alert, but it feels like we''re not alone in this cursed place.
dudGeneric91.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of {0}. The buildings are hollowed out, but there''s\
  \ a persistent sound of distant footsteps echoing from the empty corridors. We''ve searched thoroughly\
  \ - no {0} depot, but it feels like we''re being stalked by something unseen, something that knows\
  \ this place better than we do.
dudGeneric92.text={0}, we''re in the desert at {0}. It''s as silent as a tomb out here, save for\
  \ the occasional gust that sounds like a faint whisper. No {0} depot, but we keep hearing strange\
  \ noises - like metal grinding, far off but distinct. The crew''s on edge; even the bravest are\
  \ keeping their weapons drawn.
dudGeneric93.text={0}, we''re at the cliffs in {0}. We found a {0} observation post built into\
  \ the rock, but it''s abandoned and smells of decay. There''s a weird marking on the wall - a symbol\
  \ we don''t recognize, as if it was burned into the stone itself. No depot, just a sense that we''re\
  \ being watched from the shadows.
dudGeneric94.text={0}, we''ve reached {0}. The plain stretches endlessly, but we found a single {0}\
  \ helmet lying in the grass. It''s polished, unnaturally clean, almost as if it was left here recently.\
  \ The crew is spooked; some say it''s bait, others think it''s a warning. The air feels thick with\
  \ something unseen.
dudGeneric95.text={0}, we''re in the tunnels at {0}. They''re dark and damp, but it''s the sounds\
  \ that are the worst - scraping, scratching, and the occasional echo of something that doesn''t\
  \ belong. We''ve found no signs of a {0} depot, only unsettling noises and shadows that seem to move\
  \ on their own.
dudGeneric96.text={0}, we''re at the ruins of the {0} camp in {0}. It''s silent, too silent, like\
  \ everything here was drained of life. The crew claims to see figures at the edges of their vision\
  \ - always gone when they turn. No depot, just the overwhelming feeling that something dark lingers\
  \ here, unseen but present.
dudGeneric97.text={0}, we''re back at the ridge in {0}. We found a small {0} structure, barely\
  \ standing, with a door that opened on its own. No one can explain it, and no one wants to go inside.\
  \ The crew''s getting paranoid; some are talking about "the spirits of the lost," and I can''t even\
  \ laugh it off.
dudGeneric98.text={0}, we''re in the marshes at {0}. It''s dark now, and there are strange, distant\
  \ lights floating over the water. We''ve tried to approach, but they vanish before we can get close.\
  \ No {0} depot, just a feeling of dread that''s settled over the team. The silence is broken only by\
  \ occasional distant cries, almost human.
dudGeneric99.text={0}, we''re in the ice fields at {0}. It''s bitterly cold, but the strangest part\
  \ is the whispers - faint, almost unintelligible, but unmistakable. They seem to come from nowhere\
  \ and everywhere at once. No {0} depot, just a haunting reminder that some places weren''t meant to\
  \ be found.

dudStarLeague0.text={0}, we''ve reached what remains of an old SLDF supply depot at {0}. The facility\
  \ is mostly rubble now, scorched during the Amaris Coup. Some of the walls still bear the blast marks\
  \ from Kerensky''s siege. Sensors picked up faint power readings - remnants of long-dead systems\
  \ trying to hum back to life. No clear signs of functional tech or the rumored Star League cache,\
  \ just the bitter scent of decay. The air feels heavy, as if the ghosts of those last, desperate\
  \ defenders linger. The crew''s nerves are fraying; some say they hear echoes of distant gunfire in\
  \ the wind. We''re proceeding with caution.
dudStarLeague1.text={0}, we''re at the ruins of a Terran Hegemony installation in {0}, buried deep\
  \ in the forest. This base was one of the last to fall during the Amaris Coup. The bunker entrance\
  \ is blocked by debris, likely the result of self-destruct protocols triggered by the SLDF. The air\
  \ inside is stale and cold, and a few of the men claim to have seen faint blue lights flickering in\
  \ the corridors - emergency systems that shouldn''t have power after two centuries. No Star League\
  \ artifacts uncovered yet, but something about this place feels alive... and hostile.
dudStarLeague2.text={0}, we''ve reached a massive, half-collapsed SLDF logistics hub in {0}. The\
  \ place is eerie - massive hangars filled with rows of rusted unusable ''Mek parts, abandoned when\
  \ Kerensky ordered the Exodus. Old bloodstains still mark the walls, silent witnesses to the final\
  \ chaos of the Hegemony''s collapse. The crew''s on edge; sensors are giving off strange interference,\
  \ as if something in the wreckage is trying to communicate. No confirmed depot yet, just a lingering\
  \ feeling of betrayal, as if the past itself resents our intrusion.
dudStarLeague3.text={0}, we''re deep inside a crumbling SLDF command center at {0}. The central\
  \ hall is filled with the dusty remains of command consoles, likely used during Kerensky''s final\
  \ campaigns against Amaris. The walls are covered with screens still showing deployments from the\
  \ last days of the Star League. Scanners picked up encrypted data bursts - ancient transmissions,\
  \ perhaps, looping endlessly since the coup. Some of the crew refuse to enter the deeper halls,\
  \ saying the air is too cold, too full of dread. No depot detected, but this place feels like a tomb.
dudStarLeague4.text={0}, we''ve reached what seems to be an abandoned SLDF weapons cache in {0}.\
  \ The structure is intact, but something feels off. There''s a persistent, low hum that''s hard to\
  \ pinpoint, as if the building itself is resonating with some hidden energy. The crew''s uneasy -\
  \ one of the men swears he saw a figure in an old SLDF uniform, though scans show no life signs.\
  \ This site fell during one of Kerensky''s final assaults; it''s said the defenders knew they were\
  \ doomed, but fought to the last anyway. No Star League tech uncovered yet, only the eerie sense\
  \ that something from those days never left.
dudStarLeague5.text={0}, we''re inside the remains of an old SLDF research outpost at {0}. The\
  \ labs are silent, littered with debris and the scent of decay. The facility fell during the Amaris\
  \ Coup, and the walls seem to resonate with the last desperate moments of the defenders. No depot\
  \ found, only the unsettling stillness that makes even the bravest among us hesitate. It''s as if\
  \ the ghosts of Star League''s failures linger here, watching.
dudStarLeague6.text={0}, we''ve reached what was once a Terran Hegemony garrison in {0}. The\
  \ structures are in ruins, collapsed during Kerensky''s final retribution. The crew senses something\
  \ here - a presence, perhaps, or just the oppressive weight of defeat. No sign of a Star League depot,\
  \ only a gnawing feeling of dread. Some of the men are muttering that LosTech sites like these are\
  \ cursed, best left undisturbed.
dudStarLeague7.text={0}, we''re standing outside a sealed bunker at {0}. The door is massive,\
  \ reinforced, and covered in scorched marks - likely from Amaris''s forces trying to breach it.\
  \ It''s silent here, deathly so, and the air feels unnaturally cold. We haven''t found anything of\
  \ value yet, just a sense that we''re trespassing on a battlefield lost long ago. The men say this\
  \ place is cursed, that the tech within is better left untouched.
dudStarLeague8.text={0}, we''re in the wreckage of an old SLDF airfield at {0}. The winds howl\
  \ through empty hangars, carrying a faint, distant sound that''s hard to identify. The site has been\
  \ abandoned since the Exodus, and it feels like the memories of that era still haunt the place. No\
  \ sign of a depot, just whispers in the wind - if one believes in such things. The crew''s spirits\
  \ are sinking; they say the place feels cursed, as if the very ground rejects us.
dudStarLeague9.text={0}, we''re exploring the charred remains of an SLDF staging ground at {0}. The\
  \ buildings are gutted, the walls blackened by fire and riddled with bullet holes. We haven''t\
  \ uncovered any signs of a depot, only the remnants of a brutal last stand. Some of the crew believe\
  \ that sites like this one are haunted, cursed by Amaris'' hate and by those who fought for a cause\
  \ that ultimately failed.
dudStarLeague10.text={0}, we''ve reached a ruined SLDF bunker in {0}. The entrance is half-collapsed,\
  \ its steel door twisted beyond recognition. The interior is dark, and our lights barely penetrate\
  \ the dense shadows within. We haven''t found anything yet, but the feeling of being watched is\
  \ stronger than ever. The men are convinced that the depot, if it exists, is cursed - like all lost\
  \ Star League secrets.
dudStarLeague11.text={0}, we''re in a decrepit SLDF command center at {0}. The silence here is thick,\
  \ broken only by the occasional drip of water from the ceiling. No depot in sight, just rows of\
  \ dead consoles that once controlled mighty armies. The crew''s uneasy - some say this place feels\
  \ alive, like it''s waiting for something. The darkness here feels tangible, and the whispers of a\
  \ cursed past are hard to ignore.
dudStarLeague12.text={0}, we''ve reached a derelict SLDF outpost in {0}. The base is eerily quiet,\
  \ save for the creaking of old metal in the wind. We haven''t seen any signs of a depot, only the\
  \ oppressive remnants of a battle long lost. The crew is growing paranoid, claiming to hear footsteps\
  \ behind them when no one''s there. They say the tech here is cursed, echoing the despair of those\
  \ who never made it out.
dudStarLeague13.text={0}, we''re at what appears to be a forgotten SLDF logistics hub at {0}. The\
  \ facility is massive, but most of it is inaccessible, sealed off behind collapsed walls and twisted\
  \ beams. No depot yet, only dark hallways that seem to stretch endlessly. The men are on edge, as\
  \ if the very shadows are moving around them. Some whisper that sites like this are haunted by the\
  \ cursed remnants of the past, a warning to those who seek what''s been lost.
dudStarLeague14.text={0}, we''re inside the crumbling remains of an SLDF stronghold at {0}. The\
  \ air here is cold, with a strange metallic tang that clings to the back of the throat. We''ve\
  \ searched for hours, but no depot has been found. The crew is jumpy, saying that places like this\
  \ are cursed - trapped in time, haunted by the failure of a once-great Star League. The walls\
  \ themselves seem to hum with an eerie energy.
dudStarLeague15.text={0}, we''re exploring a massive SLDF command center in {0}. The facility is\
  \ vast and filled with empty command consoles that haven''t seen use since Kerensky''s Exodus. No\
  \ depot has been found, only a suffocating sense of dread. The crew swears they hear faint whispers\
  \ coming from the dark corners of the room, like distant voices that shouldn''t exist. It feels like\
  \ the cursed legacy of the Star League is all that remains here.
dudStarLeague16.text={0}, we''ve reached the ruins of an SLDF fortress at {0}. The exterior is\
  \ pitted with craters from heavy bombardment, likely from Amaris''s forces. We''ve found no depot,\
  \ but the place feels heavy with a sense of old anger and betrayal. The men say the darkness here\
  \ is unnatural, that cursed tech lies somewhere deeper within, waiting to ensnare anyone foolish\
  \ enough to seek it.
dudStarLeague17.text={0}, we''re inside an abandoned SLDF listening post at {0}. It''s been dead\
  \ silent, save for occasional pings on our sensors that vanish without explanation. No depot has\
  \ been located yet, but some of the crew claim they''ve seen shadows moving in the reflection of\
  \ the old radar screens. They say this place is cursed - haunted by the Star League''s failures.
dudStarLeague18.text={0}, we''re in the depths of a ruined SLDF research lab at {0}. The air is\
  \ stale and tinged with a strange, acrid smell that makes breathing difficult. We''ve found nothing\
  \ resembling a depot, just endless halls filled with eerie quiet. Some of the crew have begun\
  \ muttering about the cursed legacy of LosTech, saying it''s tainted by the ghosts of those who\
  \ tried to wield it.
dudStarLeague19.text={0}, we''ve reached the edge of an SLDF encampment in {0}. The camp is empty,\
  \ save for the rusted remains of tents and barricades. No depot in sight, only a pervasive sense of\
  \ doom that seems to cling to everything here. The men are convinced the site is cursed, as if the\
  \ ghosts of the Star League''s final defenders are still here, trying to keep us from uncovering their\
  \ secrets.
dudStarLeague20.text={0}, we''re inside the ruins of an SLDF testing facility at {0}. The labs are\
  \ silent, filled with broken equipment and shattered glass. We haven''t found any signs of a depot,\
  \ only a chilling emptiness. The crew is growing uneasy, saying that cursed LosTech haunts this\
  \ place, keeping it lost for a reason. It feels as if the shadows themselves want to swallow us whole.
dudStarLeague21.text={0}, we''re at what remains of an SLDF command post in {0}. The place is a shell\
  \ of its former glory - crumbling walls covered in faded insignias. No depot in sight, just a sense\
  \ of abandonment. It''s hard not to feel the weight of what''s been lost here; it''s as if the dreams\
  \ of the Star League withered alongside the men who died defending it. We keep moving, but the\
  \ futility of it all is beginning to sink in.
dudStarLeague22.text={0}, we''re at the ruins of a once-thriving SLDF logistics hub in {0}. Empty\
  \ storage bays stretch for miles, now home only to dust and silence. No depot, only the echo of a\
  \ once-unified Inner Sphere that fell apart under its own ambitions. The crew moves slowly, as if\
  \ the sadness of the place has seeped into their bones. We press on, but it feels like chasing a\
  \ lost cause.
dudStarLeague23.text={0}, we''re trudging through an old SLDF garrison at {0}. The barracks are\
  \ empty, the bunks still neatly made, as if waiting for soldiers who will never return. No depot\
  \ found, only a profound stillness that feels like grief itself. The men seem quieter here, as\
  \ if even speaking aloud would disturb the lingering sorrow of an era that died here long before us.
dudStarLeague24.text={0}, we''ve reached a ruined SLDF hospital in {0}. The halls are lined with\
  \ empty beds and broken medical equipment, remnants of a time when the Star League tried to heal\
  \ rather than destroy. No depot, just the feeling that those who were abandoned here never truly\
  \ left. The sense of futility is overwhelming - war promises glory, but it seems to leave only ghosts.
dudStarLeague25.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF communications center in {0}. The consoles are dead,\
  \ covered in layers of dust. We haven''t found the depot, just rows of silent screens that once\
  \ coordinated fleets and armies across the stars. Now, they''re just relics of ambition gone cold,\
  \ a reminder that even the greatest empires can crumble into irrelevance.
dudStarLeague26.text={0}, we''re inside a derelict SLDF armory at {0}. The halls are filled with\
  \ empty racks where weapons once stood ready to defend the ideals of the Star League. No depot in\
  \ sight, only a feeling of profound loss. The crew seems weighed down by the futility of finding\
  \ anything of value here - it''s like searching through the ashes of hope itself.
dudStarLeague27.text={0}, we''re in a deserted SLDF command center at {0}. The battle maps still\
  \ cover the walls, detailing campaigns that are now just faded memories. No depot has been found,\
  \ only the haunting realization that the grand strategies of the Star League ultimately meant\
  \ nothing. The crew''s morale is sinking; it''s hard to stay hopeful when every step seems to echo\
  \ with failure.
dudStarLeague28.text={0}, we''re among the ruins of an SLDF outpost in {0}. The outpost was likely\
  \ abandoned during Kerensky''s final campaigns, its defenders leaving behind only silent halls and\
  \ unanswered questions. No depot found, only a sense of regret that lingers in the air. It''s as if\
  \ the ghosts of those who once stood here are still waiting for orders that will never come.
dudStarLeague29.text={0}, we''re at the remnants of a once-mighty SLDF fortress in {0}. The walls\
  \ are cracked, and the turrets are silent. No depot, just the feeling of a grand dream that was\
  \ shattered by ambition and betrayal. The crew''s growing weary; they know that searching here is\
  \ like sifting through the ruins of lost ideals. The hope of finding something meaningful is fading\
  \ fast.
dudStarLeague30.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an SLDF headquarters at {0}. The command table\
  \ stands empty, as if waiting for leaders long dead. No depot found, just a sense of lost authority.\
  \ The crew is silent, perhaps out of respect for the failed ambitions that echo through these walls.\
  \ It''s hard not to wonder if we''re just repeating history - fighting for something that doesn''t\
  \ even matter anymore.
dudStarLeague31.text={0}, we''re inside an abandoned SLDF research facility at {0}. The labs are\
  \ empty, their experiments long forgotten. No depot has been uncovered, only the faded symbols of\
  \ a Star League that once promised unity. The crew''s mood is somber; this place feels like a\
  \ graveyard of forgotten dreams, a testament to the futility of trying to hold onto power through\
  \ war.
dudStarLeague32.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF barracks in {0}. The beds are unmade, as if the\
  \ soldiers left in a hurry, never to return. No depot has been found, only the oppressive silence\
  \ of lives cut short by battles that couldn''t be won. The crew is tired; each room we enter feels\
  \ like stepping into another sad story that has no ending.
dudStarLeague33.text={0}, we''re exploring a hollow SLDF outpost at {0}. The corridors are dark,\
  \ and the only sound is the wind howling through broken windows. No depot located, only a lingering\
  \ sense of despair from those who once thought they were fighting for a better future. The crew''s\
  \ morale is fading - it''s hard to believe in glory when all you find are ruins.
dudStarLeague34.text={0}, we''re at the crumbling remains of an SLDF citadel in {0}. The\
  \ structure was once a symbol of Star League power, now reduced to rubble by time and war. No\
  \ depot here, just the melancholy of lost grandeur. The crew is quiet, as if the realization has\
  \ set in that we''re searching for something that died long ago.
dudStarLeague35.text={0}, we''re inside an abandoned SLDF hangar at {0}. The bay doors are rusted\
  \ shut, and the air smells stale. No depot has been found, only the empty spaces where war machines\
  \ once stood ready. The crew seems haunted by the thought that everything we''re searching for might\
  \ just be echoes of an era that was doomed from the start.
dudStarLeague36.text={0}, we''ve reached the remains of an SLDF command hub in {0}. The control\
  \ room is filled with shattered monitors and scattered paperwork - records of battles that ended\
  \ in failure. No depot in sight, only the realization that even the most organized plans can end\
  \ in chaos. The men''s spirits are low; this place feels like a monument to the futility of trying\
  \ to control the uncontrollable.
dudStarLeague37.text={0}, we''re inside an old SLDF depot at {0}, but it''s long abandoned. The\
  \ crates are empty, and the walls bear the marks of hasty retreat. No depot found, only the\
  \ remnants of what might have been a grand storehouse of power. The crew''s mood is bleak; the\
  \ feeling here is one of missed opportunities, of efforts that ultimately amounted to nothing.
dudStarLeague38.text={0}, we''re in the hollow halls of an SLDF citadel at {0}. The banners of\
  \ the Star League still hang, tattered and faded. No depot has been found, only the sad remnants\
  \ of a once-united Inner Sphere. The crew''s morale is dwindling; the more we search, the more it\
  \ feels like we''re walking through a graveyard of ideals that were doomed from the start.
dudStarLeague39.text={0}, we''re at the edge of an old SLDF supply base in {0}. The base is silent,\
  \ its storage facilities empty and forgotten. No depot in sight, only the empty shells of what was\
  \ meant to sustain a glorious future. The crew is despondent; it''s clear that what we''re chasing\
  \ might never have existed in the first place - just another sad chapter in a history of broken\
  \ promises.
dudStarLeague40.text={0}, we''re inside the remains of an old SLDF command bunker at {0}. It''s pitch\
  \ dark, and our lights don''t seem to penetrate the shadows well. There''s a strange, rhythmic sound\
  \ - almost like a heartbeat - coming from somewhere deep below. No sign of the depot, but the air\
  \ feels heavy, oppressive. Some of the crew say they can hear faint whispers, but there''s no one\
  \ else here.
dudStarLeague41.text={0}, we''ve reached {0}, where the ruins of an SLDF staging post lie in eerie\
  \ silence. The walls are covered in strange markings - perhaps scrawled by soldiers during the final\
  \ days of the Amaris Coup. The symbols make no sense, but they seem... angry. No depot found, just\
  \ a pervasive sense of dread, like the shadows are watching us.
dudStarLeague42.text={0}, we''re at an abandoned SLDF fort in {0}. The halls echo with distant\
  \ clanging, even though we''ve confirmed there''s no one else here. Some of the crew are getting\
  \ unnerved, saying the echoes sound like old battle cries. We haven''t found the depot, just a cold,\
  \ unsettling feeling that something is trying to drive us away.
dudStarLeague43.text={0}, we''ve entered a collapsed SLDF research base at {0}. The air is stale,\
  \ and the walls seem to sweat moisture, despite the dry surroundings outside. We''ve found no depot,\
  \ but several crew members reported seeing movement at the edge of their vision. It feels like\
  \ we''re being watched by unseen eyes in the darkness.
dudStarLeague44.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an SLDF logistics center in {0}. The facility is\
  \ massive, but dead quiet - too quiet. The only sound is a faint, repetitive ticking, like a clock\
  \ that stopped ages ago but refuses to die completely. No depot in sight, only a growing sense of\
  \ fear among the crew. Some say it''s the spirits of those who never made it out.
dudStarLeague45.text={0}, we''re inside an SLDF communications hub at {0}. The consoles are dark,\
  \ but the static crackles sporadically, almost like whispers trying to form words. No depot found,\
  \ but the crew''s nerves are fraying. The longer we stay, the colder it gets, as if the very walls\
  \ are trying to expel us.
dudStarLeague46.text={0}, we''ve reached {0}, at the remnants of an SLDF barracks. The bunks are\
  \ still made, as if expecting soldiers to return, but there''s no sign of life. Some of the crew\
  \ claim to hear footsteps in the halls, heavy and deliberate, but there''s no one there. No depot,\
  \ only an overwhelming sense of being unwelcome.
dudStarLeague47.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF forward base in {0}. The air is thick with a strange\
  \ metallic scent, and the walls are stained with a dark, rusty substance. We haven''t found the\
  \ depot, just a disturbing feeling that something terrible happened here. The crew''s jumpy, and a\
  \ few refuse to go deeper into the base.
dudStarLeague48.text={0}, we''re exploring an SLDF airfield at {0}. The hangars are empty, but\
  \ we''ve been hearing faint, distant cries - like the sound of pilots calling for evac that never\
  \ came. The crew''s morale is sinking fast; some of the men believe the airfield is haunted by those\
  \ who died without hope. No depot found, just unsettling echoes that refuse to die.
dudStarLeague49.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an SLDF intelligence center at {0}. It''s dark\
  \ and cold, colder than it should be. The air seems to carry distant whispers, and the crew reports\
  \ feeling like they''re being watched. We haven''t found the depot, only an oppressive atmosphere\
  \ that makes every step feel like a mistake.
dudStarLeague50.text={0}, we''re at {0}, in what was once an SLDF hospital. The walls are smeared\
  \ with faded, bloody handprints, as if patients tried to claw their way out during the chaos of\
  \ the Amaris Coup. No depot here, only the horrifying sense that the souls of the desperate still\
  \ linger, trapped in a place that offered no salvation.
dudStarLeague51.text={0}, we''re inside an old SLDF bunker in {0}. The main hallway stretches\
  \ into darkness, with old warning signs flickering faintly in red. No depot found, but some of the\
  \ crew say they feel a strange pull deeper into the bunker, as if something is calling to them.\
  \ It''s unsettling - like a trap set by the shadows of the past.
dudStarLeague52.text={0}, we''re in the remains of an SLDF command outpost at {0}. The base is empty,\
  \ save for a faint, eerie hum that seems to vibrate through the floor. We haven''t found any trace\
  \ of the depot, but some of the men are complaining of headaches and hearing faint cries for help\
  \ that echo from nowhere.
dudStarLeague53.text={0}, we''re inside a collapsed SLDF depot at {0}. The walls are covered in\
  \ strange, unintelligible symbols, scratched into the metal with something sharp. The air feels\
  \ thick, like we''re breathing the despair of those who never left. No depot found, just a growing\
  \ sense that we''re digging up something that was meant to stay buried.
dudStarLeague54.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF staging ground in {0}. The campfires are long cold, but\
  \ it feels as if someone was here just moments ago. No depot found, only strange shadows that seem\
  \ to shift and move on their own. The crew''s morale is shot; they say the place feels cursed, like\
  \ it''s trying to drive us mad.
dudStarLeague55.text={0}, we''re exploring an SLDF forward command post in {0}. The walls are\
  \ adorned with faded battle maps, but the air is filled with a strange, sulfuric smell. No depot\
  \ in sight, but the feeling of dread is palpable. Some of the crew have started praying, saying\
  \ they can feel the despair of the fallen soldiers here.
dudStarLeague56.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an SLDF research lab at {0}. The facility is eerily\
  \ intact, almost as if it''s been waiting for us. No depot has been located, but the crew reports\
  \ feeling watched, and there''s a sense of something ancient and hostile in the air. It''s hard to\
  \ shake the feeling that we''re intruding where we shouldn''t.
dudStarLeague57.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF listening post in {0}. The base is silent, but the\
  \ sensors occasionally pick up garbled transmissions - like echoes from the past that refuse to\
  \ die. We haven''t found the depot, only a sense that this place is haunted by voices that were\
  \ never heard. The men are rattled; they say the whispers are warnings.
dudStarLeague58.text={0}, we''re at the edge of an SLDF stronghold in {0}. The walls are covered in\
  \ old blast marks, and the floors are littered with empty shell casings. No depot has been found,\
  \ but some of the men claim to hear voices in the darkness, urging us to leave. The darkness here\
  \ feels tangible, as if it''s closing in on us.
dudStarLeague59.text={0}, we''re in the depths of an SLDF citadel at {0}. The corridors are filled\
  \ with an unnatural mist that shouldn''t be here. No depot found, but the temperature keeps dropping,\
  \ and some of the crew swear they hear footsteps behind them. It feels like we''re being hunted by\
  \ something old, something that wants to keep its secrets hidden.
dudStarLeague60.text={0}, we''re inside an SLDF listening post at {0}. The facility is dark, but\
  \ our sensors keep picking up faint signals - brief, encrypted bursts that stop when we try to\
  \ trace them. It''s as if someone''s watching and adjusting to our movements. No depot located, but\
  \ the crew is on edge. We''re not alone out here.
dudStarLeague61.text={0}, we''re at an abandoned SLDF staging area in {0}. The ground is covered\
  \ in scattered debris, but there are fresh tracks in the dust - too fresh for a place supposedly\
  \ untouched for centuries. No sign of the depot, but it''s clear someone has been here recently.\
  \ The crew''s getting paranoid; it feels like we''re being followed.
dudStarLeague62.text={0}, we''re exploring an SLDF command center in {0}. The terminals are dead,\
  \ but our systems keep detecting incoming pings - like someone''s trying to hack our comms. We\
  \ haven''t found the depot, but its clear someone is trying to disrupt our search. The crew is\
  \ uneasy; it feels like we''re being watched through the very walls.
dudStarLeague63.text={0}, we''re inside the ruins of an SLDF logistics hub at {0}. The air is still,\
  \ but our sensors detected movement in the upper levels - small, fleeting heat signatures that vanish\
  \ as soon as we focus on them. No depot in sight, just the unsettling feeling that someone - or\
  \ something - is watching us from the shadows.
dudStarLeague64.text={0}, we''re in an old SLDF supply depot at {0}. The base appears deserted, but\
  \ there''s a strange static in our comms that only started when we entered. It''s almost like someone''s\
  \ trying to jam our signals, just enough to cause confusion. No depot found, but the crew is\
  \ whispering among themselves, convinced we''re under surveillance.
dudStarLeague65.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF research lab in {0}. The facility is dark, but our\
  \ scanners have picked up faint traces of motion - too quick to lock onto. We haven''t found the\
  \ depot, but the feeling of being watched is impossible to ignore. It''s as if someone is observing\
  \ our every move, waiting for us to make a mistake.
dudStarLeague66.text={0}, we''re at the edge of an SLDF airfield in {0}. The place is dead quiet,\
  \ but our sensors keep detecting small, flickering signatures at the perimeter. It feels like we''re\
  \ being circled, but whoever it is never comes close enough for a clear scan. No depot here, only\
  \ a deepening sense of unease.
dudStarLeague67.text={0}, we''re inside an abandoned SLDF barracks at {0}. The crew reports seeing\
  \ glints of light at a distance, almost like the reflection from binoculars. No depot in sight, but\
  \ it''s clear someone is keeping tabs on us. The air feels charged, and even the shadows seem to\
  \ shift when we''re not looking.
dudStarLeague68.text={0}, we''re in an SLDF bunker at {0}. Our sensors picked up a weak transmission\
  \ on an encrypted frequency - one that stopped the moment we tried to respond. It''s as if someone''s\
  \ testing us, probing our presence. No depot found, but the feeling of being watched grows stronger\
  \ with each passing moment.
dudStarLeague69.text={0}, we''re inside an old SLDF communications hub at {0}. The consoles are\
  \ offline, but our systems detected a sudden spike in electronic interference - like someone nearby\
  \ is actively scanning us. No sign of the depot, only the sense that we''re not alone. The crew''s\
  \ getting anxious; it''s like we''re being studied.
dudStarLeague70.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF forward base in {0}. We''ve seen strange lights flickering\
  \ in the distance, but they vanish whenever we try to get a closer look. It''s not just the darkness;\
  \ it feels like someone is intentionally leading us away. No depot here, just a growing sense that\
  \ someone is manipulating us.
dudStarLeague71.text={0}, we''re in the remains of an SLDF intelligence post at {0}. Our equipment\
  \ keeps malfunctioning - static on the comms, sudden power fluctuations. No depot found, but it''s\
  \ clear someone is trying to interfere with our search. The crew''s starting to get jittery, convinced\
  \ we''re being hunted by an unseen observer.
dudStarLeague72.text={0}, we''re inside an SLDF fort at {0}. The place is silent, but our scanners\
  \ detected what might be surveillance scans - brief pings that vanish when we try to triangulate\
  \ them. No depot located, but the feeling of being monitored is becoming unbearable. The crew is\
  \ whispering that we''ve walked into a trap.
dudStarLeague73.text={0}, we''re at an old SLDF depot in {0}. The facility is mostly rubble, No\
  \ depot in sight, only the unsettling suspicion that someone is documenting our every move. The\
  \ crew''s growing paranoid, convinced we''re part of someone else''s plan.
dudStarLeague74.text={0}, we''re in an SLDF command post at {0}. The sensors are acting up - picking\
  \ up multiple small heat signatures, but they fade away as soon as we get closer. No depot found,\
  \ just the unsettling feeling that someone is tracking us, adjusting their position to stay just\
  \ out of sight.
dudStarLeague75.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF stronghold in {0}. The corridors are filled with\
  \ shadows that seem to stretch and twist as we pass. We''ve seen flashes of movement, but nothing\
  \ shows up on our sensors. No depot here, only a sense of unseen eyes following us, observing our\
  \ every step.
dudStarLeague76.text={0}, we''re exploring the ruins of an SLDF depot at {0}. The crew reports\
  \ seeing faint lights in the distance, but they''re too erratic to be natural. No depot found, but\
  \ it feels like someone''s setting up a perimeter around us, watching, waiting. The crew''s getting\
  \ restless, convinced that whoever it is wants us to stop searching - for reasons unknown.
dudStarLeague77.text={0}, we''re inside an SLDF logistics hub at {0}. We''ve seen strange flashes,\
  \ like camera flashes, in the darkness. No depot located, only a creeping suspicion that we''re being\
  \ recorded - watched like rats in a maze. The crew''s morale is slipping; they feel exposed, vulnerable.
dudStarLeague78.text={0}, we''re in an abandoned SLDF base at {0}. The facility is deserted, but\
  \ we''ve picked up faint infrared signals from the surrounding hills - like distant observers trying\
  \ to stay hidden. No depot found, just a deepening sense that we''re part of someone''s game.
dudStarLeague79.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF control center in {0}. Our comms have been glitching\
  \ non-stop, and there''s a strange clicking sound on the encrypted channel. No depot has been located,\
  \ but the crew''s sure someone is eavesdropping on us. It feels like every word, every step, is being\
  \ cataloged by unseen eyes.
dudStarLeague80.text={0}, we''re inside a ruined SLDF command bunker at {0}. The walls still bear\
  \ screens showing flickering maps of Kerensky''s last campaigns. It''s eerie, as if the General\
  \ himself left these plans behind for us to find. No depot yet, just the feeling that we''re walking\
  \ among the echoes of his final orders - a legacy that''s long been lost to the stars.
dudStarLeague81.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF forward base in {0}. There''s a worn plaque here,\
  \ commemorating one of Kerensky''s pivotal battles during the Hegemony Campaign. It''s covered in\
  \ rust, but his name is still visible, a reminder of the ideals he fought for. No depot found,\
  \ just the sense that his presence lingers, urging us forward despite the odds.
dudStarLeague82.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an SLDF supply hub at {0}. The crew found an old\
  \ banner bearing Kerensky''s name, torn but still recognizable. No sign of the depot, but the place\
  \ feels sacred - like we''re treading on ground that once resounded with the General''s commands.\
  \ Morale is high, as if the spirit of Kerensky himself is watching over us.
dudStarLeague83.text={0}, we''re inside an abandoned SLDF stronghold in {0}. The walls are lined\
  \ with crumbling quotes from Kerensky''s speeches, still legible despite the decay. The crew is silent,\
  \ moved by his words. No depot found, just a profound sense of honor mixed with sorrow. It''s hard\
  \ not to feel like we''re living in the shadow of greatness.
dudStarLeague84.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF base in {0}. The crew found an old comms console engraved\
  \ with a simple line: "For the General." No depot here, just a palpable sense of reverence for the\
  \ man who tried to save the Star League from its own destruction. The team feels a renewed\
  \ determination, driven by Kerensky''s spirit to keep searching.
dudStarLeague85.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF logistics post at {0}. There''s a statue here,\
  \ partially collapsed but unmistakably depicting Kerensky. It''s covered in grime, but his eyes\
  \ seem to watch us with a mix of hope and disappointment. No depot yet, but the crew is visibly\
  \ humbled by his enduring legacy.
dudStarLeague86.text={0}, we''re inside an old SLDF headquarters at {0}. The central command table\
  \ still bears the symbol of Kerensky''s forces. It feels like a memorial to a lost era, a silent\
  \ tribute to the man who led the Exodus. No depot found, only a sense of duty to honor what he\
  \ stood for - even in failure.
dudStarLeague87.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF training camp in {0}. The crew stumbled upon an old\
  \ insignia bearing the motto: "Strength through unity." No depot in sight, but the words seem\
  \ to echo through the empty halls, a reminder of the ideals that died when the Star League fell\
  \ apart.
dudStarLeague88.text={0}, we''re exploring a remote SLDF bunker at {0}. The walls are covered in\
  \ graffiti from soldiers who once served under Kerensky, some of it pleading for his return. No\
  \ depot found, only a lingering sense of loyalty that stretches across the centuries.
dudStarLeague89.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF comms station in {0}. The crew found a plaque\
  \ commemorating Kerensky''s victory over Amaris, now rusted and nearly unreadable. No depot, just\
  \ the remnants of glory that faded with his departure. The men are unusually quiet, as if they can\
  \ feel the weight of Kerensky''s unfulfilled dream.
dudStarLeague90.text={0}, we''re in an abandoned SLDF outpost at {0}. Half written letters to family\
  \ lie scattered, a quick look through them speaks to a time of war, a desire to return to peace,\
  \ and fear of the coming war to retake Terra. No depot, just a haunting sense of apprehension that\
  \ still clings to the air, as if even the General''s followers were unsure of their fate.
dudStarLeague91.text={0}, we''re in an SLDF barracks at {0}. The crew found a dusty old portrait\
  \ of Kerensky, half-covered by fallen debris. His gaze seems to pierce through the centuries, a\
  \ silent witness to the search that continues long after his departure. No depot, just a deep sense\
  \ of loss.
dudStarLeague92.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF armory in {0}. The walls bear the symbol of Kerensky''s\
  \ command - now faded, but still potent. No depot located, but the feeling of walking in the footsteps\
  \ of the General is unmistakable. The crew feels a mix of inspiration and sadness, as if the weight\
  \ of history itself is upon them.
dudStarLeague93.text={0}, we''re inside an SLDF depot at {0}. The base''s main hall has a mural\
  \ dedicated to Kerensky''s final speech before the Exodus. It''s faded, but the words still carry weight.\
  \ No depot found, only a sense of melancholy as we realize that his dream of unity is more distant\
  \ than ever.
dudStarLeague94.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF memorial site in {0}. The plaque here reads: "For General\
  \ Kerensky - last hope of the Star League." No depot located, but the crew is unusually somber, as\
  \ if the place itself demands respect. It''s a painful reminder that even the greatest leaders\
  \ couldn''t prevent the collapse.
dudStarLeague95.text={0}, we''re in the ruins of an SLDF command center at {0}. The central console\
  \ still bears the symbol of Kerensky''s forces, now corroded but visible. No depot here, just the\
  \ feeling that we''re walking among the last vestiges of a legacy that ultimately led to self-exile.
dudStarLeague96.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF base in {0}. The crew found a handwritten note from one\
  \ of Kerensky''s officers, addressed to "the General" and left unfinished. No depot found, only the\
  \ lingering sense of promises unfulfilled. The team is subdued, as if they''re feeling the weight\
  \ of a history that never had a happy ending.
dudStarLeague97.text={0}, we''re inside an old SLDF staging area at {0}. The base is filled with\
  \ broken gear, but there''s a large mural of Kerensky in the main hall, now barely recognizable. No\
  \ depot located, only a profound sense of reverence for the man who once led these soldiers.
dudStarLeague98.text={0}, we''re at an SLDF fort in {0}. The crew discovered an old battle standard\
  \ bearing Kerensky''s name, untouched for centuries. No depot, but the sense of honor and loss is\
  \ overwhelming. It''s hard not to feel like we''re chasing the remnants of a dream that died with him.
dudStarLeague99.text={0}, we''re in an SLDF depot at {0}. There''s a statue of Kerensky here, toppled\
  \ and broken. It''s a painful sight, a symbol of the Star League''s fall and the General''s departure.\
  \ No depot found, only the reminder that his vision, though noble, couldn''t prevent the inevitable\
  \ collapse.

  \ of complications.
proposition3.text={0}, I commend your efforts in locating the Star League depot, a site potentially\
  \ linked to the SLDF''s lost glory. We propose a straightforward exchange: a significant amount of\

proposition4.text={0}, consider this a final offer concerning the Star League depot. We can provide a\

  \ to the SLDF. Refusal could invite scrutiny from factions less concerned with diplomacy. A quick,\
  \ discreet transaction benefits both sides. Choose wisely, as time is limited.
proposition5.text={0}, the Star League depot you''re pursuing is of significant interest to my associates,\
  \ particularly due to its potential ties to the SLDF''s storied history. We are ready to transfer a\

  \ beneficial. However, failing to respond could attract less favorable attention from other factions.
proposition6.text={0}, I must reiterate the urgency of securing the Star League depot''s coordinates. It\
  \ holds immense strategic and historical value, particularly for those who respect the SLDF''s legacy.\
  \ My principals are prepared to make a swift, substantial payment in C-bills. Be aware that delaying\
  \ could draw interest from parties who might not negotiate as fairly.
proposition7.text={0}, I represent a group that considers the Star League depot, and any links to the SLDF,\
  \ to be invaluable. We offer a generous sum of C-bills for its coordinates. This is an opportunity\
  \ to secure immediate resources. A refusal could, however, alter the nature of future negotiations\
  \ - possibly not to your advantage.
proposition8.text={0}, we both know the Star League depot has implications beyond mere salvage. It''s a\
  \ relic of the SLDF''s strength and influence. We are ready to provide a significant transfer of\
  \ C-bills for its location. Consider this a strategic alliance. Declining may invite attention\
  \ from those who prefer force over finance.
proposition9.text={0}, the Star League depot represents more than just lost technology; it''s a piece of\
  \ SLDF heritage. My associates wish to acquire its location and will provide immediate compensation\
  \ in C-bills. Refusal to cooperate could have broader implications for your operations, especially\
  \ if others decide to pursue this more aggressively.
proposition10.text={0}, the Star League depot holds more than just salvage - it holds history, specifically\
  \ that of the SLDF. We are prepared to offer a substantial sum of C-bills in exchange for its\
  \ precise location. Declining this offer may lead to less pleasant inquiries from other interested\
  \ factions. The choice is yours, but time is running short.
proposition11.text={0}, your pursuit of the Star League depot has reached the attention of those who\
  \ hold the SLDF in high regard. We wish to negotiate the exchange of its coordinates for C-bills.\
  \ The offer is fair, immediate, and advantageous. A refusal could complicate matters with parties\
  \ more focused on the depot''s strategic value than on monetary compensation.
proposition12.text={0}, securing the location of the Star League depot is of paramount importance to my\
  \ principals, particularly given its ties to the SLDF''s legacy. We offer substantial C-bills for\
  \ this information, with no strings attached. However, withholding the location could lead to\
  \ unexpected confrontations from other interested parties.
proposition13.text={0}, the Star League depot is of immense value to my associates, especially given its\
  \ historical link to the SLDF. We propose a significant sum of C-bills for the coordinates. Be\
  \ aware that delays or refusals could prompt actions from less patient factions. Your cooperation\
  \ ensures both profit and peace.
proposition14.text={0}, the Star League depot''s connection to the SLDF is well understood by my principals.\
  \ We offer a substantial transfer of C-bills in exchange for its location. Declining may draw\
  \ interest from other factions with fewer concerns about diplomacy and more about possession.
proposition15.text={0}, the Star League depot you seek is a critical piece of SLDF history. We are\
  \ prepared to offer immediate compensation in C-bills for its coordinates. Be aware that others\
  \ may soon seek it by force, making this offer one of the safer paths forward.
proposition16.text={0}, the Star League depot holds vital historical insights related to the SLDF''s past.\
  \ We are interested only in the coordinates and will offer C-bills in return. It''s a straightforward\
  \ transaction, but declining it may lead to a more aggressive pursuit from other factions.
proposition17.text={0}, the Star League depot is of significant interest due to its ties to the SLDF''s\
  \ final days. We wish to acquire the coordinates and are prepared to offer a considerable sum of\
  \ C-bills. Your cooperation ensures a smooth exchange. Refusal could, however, attract the wrong\
  \ kind of attention.
proposition18.text={0}, I represent a group deeply invested in Star League history, specifically that of\
  \ the SLDF. We propose a discreet exchange of C-bills for the depot''s location. Declining this\
  \ offer could complicate your current mission, as others may choose a more direct approach.
proposition19.text={0}, the Star League depot''s link to the SLDF makes it uniquely valuable. My principals\
  \ are prepared to offer a generous sum of C-bills for its coordinates. Accepting ensures mutual\
  \ benefit, while refusal could draw the interest of parties less inclined toward peaceful negotiations.
proposition20.text={0}, some things are not meant to be found - yet here you are, on the trail of a Star\
  \ League depot tied to the SLDF. We seek its location and offer C-bills in exchange. This knowledge\
  \ is not without its burdens, but the rewards can be... enlightening. Choose wisely.
proposition21.text={0}, the past holds many secrets, as does the Star League depot you seek. We are\
  \ prepared to transfer C-bills for its coordinates, but understand: knowledge can bring shadows.\
  \ Refuse, and the shadows may grow longer than you expect.
proposition22.text={0}, you are walking in the footsteps of the SLDF, tracing paths they once tread in\
  \ secrecy. We seek the same location as you, and offer C-bills to lighten your burden. Know that\
  \ roads not taken often have watchers.
proposition23.text={0}, the Star League depot''s secrets are old, but our interest in them is new. The\
  \ coordinates, exchanged for C-bills, could secure your future - if you choose to share them. Just\
  \ remember, history is often written by those who find it first.
proposition24.text={0}, we sense you are close to the Star League depot, an echo of the SLDF''s lost\
  \ legacy. We offer C-bills for its location, and our offer stands for a short time. Remember, eyes\
  \ are always watching those who seek the past.
proposition25.text={0}, the location you seek has seen more than battles; it has seen betrayal and\
  \ ambition. The Star League depot''s coordinates are valuable to us. C-bills are offered in exchange.\
  \ Be cautious - persistence can attract the gaze of those who move in silence.
proposition26.text={0}, what you chase is both tangible and elusive. We seek only the coordinates of\
  \ the Star League depot, and we offer C-bills in return. Time is a fickle ally; those who linger\
  \ too long may find themselves pursued.
proposition27.text={0}, the SLDF left many things behind - this depot is just one of them. We are willing\
  \ to compensate you in C-bills for its location. But be aware: old ghosts often find new hunters.\
  \ Delay may not be wise.
proposition28.text={0}, some legacies were never meant to be uncovered, yet here you are. The Star League\
  \ depot holds value, and so do C-bills. We offer them in exchange for the coordinates, but whispers\
  \ travel fast. Silence has a cost.
proposition29.text={0}, you approach a place where the SLDF''s intentions are frozen in time. We wish to\
  \ acquire the coordinates, offering C-bills for what you find. But tread lightly - there are those\
  \ who would prefer that such locations remain forgotten.
proposition30.text={0}, the Star League depot is a key - one that unlocks both opportunity and danger.\
  \ We seek its location, offering C-bills for your cooperation. But keys can turn both ways; keep\
  \ that in mind as you consider our offer.
proposition31.text={0}, knowledge of the SLDF''s remnants carries weight, as does the Star League depot''s\
  \ location. We offer C-bills in exchange, but understand this: you are not the only seeker. The\
  \ quietest hunters are often the deadliest.
proposition32.text={0}, the past calls to those who listen, and it seems you have answered. The Star\
  \ League depot holds truths that should be uncovered, for the right price. We offer C-bills, but\
  \ others may offer something far less forgiving.
proposition33.text={0}, the SLDF once guarded secrets with zeal, and this Star League depot is no\
  \ exception. We seek its coordinates and will provide C-bills in return. Be wary - secrets long\
  \ buried can attract dangerous interest.
proposition34.text={0}, you walk a path few dare to tread. The Star League depot is closer than you\
  \ think. We offer C-bills for its location, but haste is advised. The past has many eyes, and not\
  \ all are friendly.
proposition35.text={0}, the SLDF''s legacy is fraught with hidden agendas. The Star League depot is part\
  \ of that tale. We offer C-bills for its coordinates, but know that even shadows have their own\
  \ purposes.
proposition36.text={0}, some say the Star League depot is cursed, others that it is guarded. We are\
  \ interested only in its location, offering C-bills in exchange. But consider this: doors opened\
  \ too soon can let in more than just opportunity.
proposition37.text={0}, you seek what the SLDF could not protect forever. The Star League depot''s\
  \ coordinates are what we desire, and C-bills are what we offer. However, hesitation can be\
  \ dangerous when others are also searching.
proposition38.text={0}, the Star League depot you pursue is part of a larger web, one spun long ago.\
  \ We wish to know its location, and C-bills are our currency of exchange. Be warned, however -\
  \ some webs have more than one spider.
proposition39.text={0}, the depot''s coordinates are more than just a location; they are a piece of the\
  \ SLDF''s forgotten war. We offer C-bills in return, but the clock is ticking. Know that the past\
  \ is a powerful force, and it does not always forgive.
proposition40.text={0}, the Star League depot you seek is a dangerous prize. We demand the coordinates\
  \ in exchange for C-bills. Refuse, and others - far less diplomatic - will come calling. You don''t\
  \ want to be in their crosshairs.
proposition41.text={0}, time is not your ally. The SLDF left behind many secrets, and this Star League\
  \ depot is one of the most coveted. Provide the coordinates, accept the C-bills, and avoid\
  \ complications. Refuse, and those complications will find you.
proposition42.text={0}, your pursuit of the Star League depot is attracting attention beyond your control.\
  \ We offer C-bills in exchange for the coordinates, but consider this your final chance. The next\
  \ contact may not be as patient - or as generous.
proposition43.text={0}, we know you''re close to the Star League depot. Deliver the coordinates, or face\
  \ the consequences of keeping such knowledge hidden. Our offer of C-bills is the only peaceful\
  \ resolution you''ll receive.
proposition44.text={0}, history''s secrets are not meant for everyone. The Star League depot is no exception.\
  \ We offer C-bills for its location, but decline at your own peril. Others will be less interested\
  \ in negotiation and more interested in results.
proposition45.text={0}, you may believe you have time, but that is a dangerous illusion. The Star League\
  \ depot''s coordinates are needed now. Accept the C-bills offered, or expect a less pleasant approach\
  \ from others already en route.
proposition46.text={0}, this is not merely an offer - it''s a warning. The Star League depot has many eyes\
  \ upon it, some less forgiving than others. Provide the coordinates, take the C-bills, and leave\
  \ the shadows behind. Refusal will only invite them closer.
proposition47.text={0}, the SLDF''s secrets come with a heavy cost. You stand at a crossroads: accept our\
  \ C-bills for the Star League depot''s location, or face the inevitable interest of those who won''t\
  \ ask twice.
proposition48.text={0}, we both know the value of the Star League depot. We also know the danger of delay.\
  \ We offer C-bills for its coordinates. Decline, and the next visitor may not be inclined to negotiate.
proposition49.text={0}, we understand the risks you''ve taken in finding the Star League depot. But risks\
  \ have a way of multiplying when they''re ignored. Provide the coordinates and accept our C-bills,\
  \ or suffer the consequences of silence.
proposition50.text={0}, the Star League depot''s location is no longer a secret. Others are closing in,\
  \ and their intentions are not as peaceful as ours. This is your final opportunity to exchange it\
  \ for C-bills. Refuse, and you may find yourself hunted.
proposition51.text={0}, you are walking a dangerous path. The SLDF left behind many ghosts, and the Star\
  \ League depot is one of them. Give us the coordinates and take the C-bills, or find yourself\
  \ haunted by more than just history.
proposition52.text={0}, the past can be a cruel teacher. The Star League depot''s location is of great\
  \ interest to many, not all of whom care for your well-being. Deliver the coordinates and secure\
  \ your C-bills. The alternative is far less forgiving.
proposition53.text={0}, we are not alone in our pursuit of the Star League depot. Provide the coordinates,\
  \ accept the C-bills, and avoid the chaos that follows. Delay will only attract the wolves.
proposition54.text={0}, you must understand: the Star League depot is a beacon, and you are standing too\
  \ close. Offer the coordinates in exchange for C-bills, or expect the arrival of those who prefer to\
  \ take what they want by force.
proposition55.text={0}, knowledge of the SLDF depot''s location is a dangerous thing. We offer C-bills for\
  \ the coordinates, but time is running out. Those who do not act quickly often become collateral.
proposition56.text={0}, we will not wait forever. The Star League depot is too valuable, and your hesitation\
  \ is drawing dangerous attention. Provide the coordinates, take the C-bills, and avoid the fate of\
  \ those who are too slow to act.
proposition57.text={0}, the Star League depot has become a target, and so have you. Deliver the coordinates\
  \ now, receive your C-bills, and walk away. Refuse, and you may find your options rapidly disappearing.
proposition58.text={0}, this is the last offer you''ll receive from us regarding the Star League depot.\
  \ Accept the C-bills for its coordinates, or face those who have less patience for negotiation. You\
  \ do not want to test their resolve.
proposition59.text={0}, the SLDF depot is a prize worth fighting for - and dying for. We offer C-bills\
  \ for its location, but be warned: others are not far behind, and they are far less concerned with\
  \ your survival.
proposition60.text={0}, I hear you''re getting close to that Star League depot. I''ve got some serious C-bills\
  \ waiting for you if you''re willing to share the location. Let''s keep this simple and beneficial for\
  \ both of us. After all, who needs unnecessary complications, right?
proposition61.text={0}, you''ve done some impressive work tracking that Star League depot! I''ve got a good\
  \ feeling about this. How about we make a deal? A generous sum of C-bills in exchange for the coordinates\
  \ - no strings attached. Let''s make this a win-win, shall we?
proposition62.text={0}, I''ve always admired your tenacity. Finding a Star League depot is no small feat!\
  \ I''m willing to pay a fair amount of C-bills for the location. No need to make things difficult -\
  \ just a straightforward deal between two professionals.
proposition63.text={0}, it''s not every day someone stumbles across a Star League depot. Lucky for you,\
  \ I happen to be in the market for that exact kind of information. I''ll make it worth your while -\
  \ C-bills, quick and easy. What do you say?
proposition64.text={0}, I''ll be honest - this Star League depot is the stuff of legend. I''m sure you''re\
  \ ready for a good payday, so how about we swap the coordinates for a nice pile of C-bills? No fuss,\
  \ no hassle - just a friendly exchange.
proposition65.text={0}, you''re on the verge of a big find! I''m talking about that Star League depot, of\
  \ course. I''ve got a hefty sum of C-bills ready to go, just for the coordinates. Think of it as a\
  \ friendly favor that pays off handsomely.
proposition66.text={0}, it''s not every day someone uncovers a piece of SLDF history like this depot. I''d\
  \ love to be a part of your success story. Let''s swap the coordinates for a good amount of C-bills,\
  \ and you''ll walk away with a heavy wallet.
proposition67.text={0}, I''ve been following your progress with this Star League depot, and I''ve got to\
  \ say, I like your style! How about a friendly deal - coordinates for C-bills? It''s a simple trade\
  \ that''ll put a smile on your face.
proposition68.text={0}, you''ve done the hard work of finding the Star League depot, and now I''d like to\
  \ help you cash in on it. I''ve got C-bills with your name on them, ready to be transferred as soon\
  \ as we get the coordinates. Easy money!
proposition69.text={0}, you and I both know how rare it is to find something tied to the SLDF. I''ve got\
  \ the C-bills to make this worth your while. Let''s keep things simple - coordinates for cash. No\
  \ need to make this more complicated than it has to be!
proposition70.text={0}, you''ve got a nose for finding lost treasures, and that Star League depot is a\
  \ prime example. I''m offering a nice pile of C-bills for the location. Let''s make this a friendly,\
  \ profitable exchange. After all, who doesn''t like a good payday?
proposition71.text={0}, you''re on a hot streak with this Star League depot, and I want to be a part of\
  \ it. I''m offering a generous sum of C-bills for the coordinates - easy money for you, and no strings\
