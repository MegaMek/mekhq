# getDialogReference (salvage)
salvaged0.text=The salvage team just finished their sweep. Some of the cargo is\
  \ practically brand new, with no visible wear or damage - a rare find in these\
  \ conditions. On the other hand, much of it looks like it's been scavenged\
  \ multiple times before. Even the rougher pieces could still serve us well in a\
  \ pinch, provided we use them wisely. %s
salvaged1.text=We pulled a variety of supplies from the last skirmish. Some items are in\
  \ nearly perfect condition, almost as if they were never used. Others appear\
  \ cobbled together, likely just to stay functional. Still, this batch has clear\
  \ tactical potential, especially once we sift through it to separate the gems\
  \ from the junk. %s
salvaged2.text=This latest batch of captured cargo is better than anticipated. A fair portion\
  \ is fully functional, ready for immediate use. However, some items seem to be\
  \ held together by sheer desperation and duct tape. We'll need to sort through\
  \ everything quickly to identify which assets can be put to use right away. %s
salvaged3.text=We've secured a decent amount of usable material from the enemy's hold. There's\
  \ a mix of pristine equipment and some more battered remnants. The newer gear\
  \ could directly enhance our operations, while the rougher pieces might require\
  \ a few quick repairs before they're combat-ready again. %s
salvaged4.text=Our salvage efforts have yielded a diverse collection of materials. Some of\
  \ it is in excellent condition, suggesting it was either new or barely used.\
  \ However, quite a bit looks like it was hastily patched together. We'll need\
  \ to get creative if we want to make the most out of these less pristine items. %s
salvaged5.text=The latest cache of captured supplies ranges from nearly untouched to barely\
  \ usable. The high-quality finds could improve our tactical operations\
  \ immediately. The more damaged pieces will require some work, but with effort,\
  \ they could still hold significant value for our ongoing needs. %s
salvaged6.text=The latest load presents an interesting mix. Some items are untouched,\
  \ seemingly ready for immediate deployment, while others appear to have been\
  \ salvaged several times over. The less pristine pieces will require some quick\
  \ maintenance, but we can still derive tactical utility from this batch. %s
salvaged7.text=This captured cargo exhibits a wide spectrum of quality. A few items are\
  \ in mint condition, as if they were meant for delivery to a fresh unit.\
  \ However, the rest will need more than a bit of maintenance before they can be\
  \ fielded, though they still have potential value. %s
salvaged8.text=The latest haul includes a surprising number of intact materials, but not\
  \ everything is in such good shape. While many items are ready for immediate\
  \ use, others are clearly not worth adding to the attached itinerary due to\
  \ their poor condition. %s
salvaged9.text=We've managed to pull a wide array of resources from the enemy's stores.\
  \ Some of it is still in original packaging, which is rare given the\
  \ circumstances. The rest ranges from passable to dilapidated, but even the\
  \ worst of it could be refurbished with some effort. %s

looted0.text=With our departure finally approaching, we managed to secure the most\
  \ valuable supplies we could find. Most of it was in decent condition, but\
  \ we were limited to what we could physically carry. The bulkier items were\
  \ left behind, as we simply didn't have the energy or space to take them along\
  \ on this final stretch. %s
looted1.text=We looted what we could, focusing on the highest-value supplies to maximize\
  \ our haul. Most of the items were ready for transport, but we were exhausted\
  \ by then. We opted to leave behind anything that wasn't essential, or that would\
  \ have required significant effort to move. %s
looted2.text=We managed to grab the most essential supplies, but it felt like the last\
  \ leg of a marathon. While some items were in good shape and easy to carry,\
  \ we simply lacked the energy to deal with anything that required extra\
  \ handling or repair work, so we left those behind. %s
looted3.text=We've secured the best supplies we could find, and now we're finally getting\
  \ out of here! Most of the items we took are in good condition, and we only\
  \ carried what was easily transportable. Leaving behind the bulkier stuff was\
  \ a strategic decision, and it feels like a win in this tough situation. %s
looted4.text=Securing the supplies went smoother than expected, and we're now ready to lift\
  \ off! We focused on grabbing the most critical items, leaving the less essential\
  \ ones behind without hesitation. Knowing that we're done here brings a sense\
  \ of relief, and it feels good to be moving forward. %s
looted5.text=We managed to secure the most useful supplies, and it's finally time to say\
  \ goodbye to this place. We took only the most transportable items, leaving behind\
  \ anything too bulky or cumbersome. The team is in high spirits - just glad to be\
  \ getting off this rock and onto the next phase of our journey. %s
looted6.text=We've gathered the necessary supplies as planned. Most of the items were\
  \ in good condition, and we prioritized those that were easily transportable.\
  \ Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we had to leave the bulkier items\
  \ behind, which was expected but still frustrating. %s
looted7.text=We've grabbed what supplies we could manage, prioritizing items in decent\
  \ condition. We had to leave many things behind, focusing only on the essentials.\
  \ Given our limited capacity, we don't have the time or space to carry more,\
  \ so we're making do with what we have. %s
looted8.text=We've packed up the most valuable supplies we could find, but it's a desperate\
  \ load. We had to leave a lot of potentially useful materials behind due to space\
  \ and time constraints. It feels like we're leaving part of our future here,\
  \ but there was simply no other option. %s
looted9.text=We finished securing the supplies, but it doesn't feel like enough. We\
  \ managed to load the basics, but many vital items had to be left behind. We're\
  \ departing with what we could carry, but it feels like we're barely scraping\
  \ by as we move forward. %s

guerrillaSwindled2.text=Ah, %s, it was fun while it lasted.\
  \ But, as they say, 'business is business', and you were just too easy to take for a ride.\
  \ Enjoy your ongoing battle with %s - it's one you can keep fighting without my help.\
  \ By the time you catch on, I'll be just a distant, expensive memory.
guerrillaSwindled3.text=%s, it's been a pleasure doing business...well, for me at least.\
  \ Those C-Bills have already found a safer home, and trust me, it's nowhere\
  \ you'd ever reach. Enjoy the generous donation, and next time? Maybe\
  \ don't trust strangers with a slick offer.
guerrillaSwindled4.text=%s, here's the hard truth: you were played. Those C-Bills\
  \ are fueling my next great escape, far away from your mess with %s.\
  \ Think of it as a lesson learned, if that helps. I'll be thinking of\
  \ you...while I enjoy every last C-Bill.

guerrillaSwindled9.text=%s, consider this your wake-up call. You've got %s to worry\

  \ it's been a pleasure, but I'd be lying.
guerrillaSwindled10.text=%s, sometimes you gotta respect the art of a good con.\
  \ Your C-Bills are doing wonders for my retirement plans, while you're\

guerrillaSwindled11.text=Hey %s, heard there's a fine line between bravery and\
  \ foolishness - guess you found it. I'll be raising a glass to you from\
  \ somewhere warm, funded by your generosity. Keep it up with %s, and\
  \ don't worry about me.
guerrillaSwindled12.text=%s, all those C-Bills for a ghost and a promise. You've\
  \ made it far, but you slipped up this time. I'll be long gone by the\
  \ time you read this, probably sipping a PPC. Thanks for bankrolling the journey.
guerrillaSwindled13.text=%s, when it comes to playing the odds, sometimes you're\
  \ on the wrong side. Consider this my parting gift - your C-Bills are\
  \ mine, and you're on your own against %s. Don't take it too hard.\
  \ It's just business.
guerrillaSwindled14.text=%s, I was almost tempted to come through. But you made\
  \ the deal way too easy, and where's the fun in that? I'll be putting\
  \ those C-Bills to better use than you ever would've. By the time\
  \ you've pieced this together, I'll be jumps away. Good luck out there with %s.
guerrillaSwindled15.text=%s, you really ought to be more careful who you trust.\
  \ Those C-Bills of yours are already well spent, and you're left holding\
  \ the bag. Hope you and %s have fun without me.
guerrillaSwindled16.text=%s, next time, maybe don't believe everything you hear.\
  \ I'm already gone, and your C-Bills are going to fuel a far more\
  \ comfortable life than the one you're fighting for. Thanks for\
  \ the funding!
guerrillaSwindled17.text=%s, business is all about taking opportunities, wouldn't\
  \ you say? You just happened to be my opportunity this time. Your C-Bills\
  \ are history, and so am I. Good luck keeping up with %s without my help.
guerrillaSwindled18.text=%s, it's impressive how easy it was to slip away with\
  \ those C-Bills. Consider it a compliment to my talents and a lesson\
  \ for you. You're on your own against %s now - I'll be sure to think\
  \ of you...occasionally.
guerrillaSwindled19.text=%s, let's be real - this was a one-sided deal from the start.\
  \ I walk away with your C-Bills, and you're left with nothing but regrets.\
  \ Enjoy the fight with %s; I'll enjoy the spoils.
guerrillaSwindled20.text=%s, I'd say I'm sorry, but I'd be lying. Your C-Bills are\

  \ you'll think twice before trusting a smooth talker.
guerrillaSwindled21.text=%s, you know, there's an art to taking someone for a ride.\
  \ Thanks for the contribution - I'll put it to good use. Meanwhile, %s is\
  \ still breathing down your neck, and I'm already in the wind. Take care!
guerrillaSwindled22.text=%s, by the time you figure out just how bad I played you,\

  \ Good luck with %s - you'll need it.
guerrillaSwindled23.text=%s, looks like the student got schooled. Your C-Bills are\

  \ potential fuel caches, possibly left behind by retreating forces. We're also rerouting to a\
  \ safer path, taking advantage of lower inclines to ease fuel demands. Morale is high, and the\
  \ crew's handling it well - typical day on the job. We're confident about reaching the next\
  \ checkpoint without delays.
statusUpdate3.text=Met an allied logistics convoy running low on fuel and rations, %s. The exchange\
  \ was routine, carried out with the efficiency of those used to survival in harsh conditions.\
  \ The strain was evident in their faces. The crew presses forward. ETA to delivery is 17 hours,\
  \ with steady progress.
statusUpdate4.text=Reached a makeshift checkpoint run by starving civilians, %s. They asked for\
  \ food, but we had none to give. Their desperation was palpable, etched into their gaunt faces\
  \ and hollow eyes. We pushed through without incident, but the scene stays with us, another\
  \ reminder of the misery that defines this war. The crew is quiet, morale low - there's no sense\
  \ of victory in pushing forward, only a grim determination to complete the mission. ETA to\
  \ delivery is 17 hours, but the burden of what we cannot change grows heavier.
statusUpdate5.text=Sorry for the blackout, %s, radio antenna was bent by a low-hanging branch. The\
  \ team just finished a quick field repair, restoring full communication capabilities without any\
  \ additional issues. All units are maintaining contact, with regular check-ins confirmed. The\
  \ convoy is proceeding as planned, with no deviation from the established route. No delays are\
  \ expected at this time.
statusUpdate6.text=Detour forced by fallen trees, %s. The arrangement seems too neat to be mere\
  \ chance - perhaps it's nature, or perhaps it's enemy sappers. Crew members swear they've seen\
  \ movement in the treeline, dark shapes that vanish before they can be confirmed. We're advancing\
  \ cautiously, weapons ready, each rustle of leaves amplified by the silence that follows. There's\
  \ a growing sense that we're being funneled somewhere, like prey unaware of the hunter. Spirits\
  \ are uneasy, but discipline holds for now. ETA still stands at 18 hours, but the sense of dread\
  \ is growing.
statusUpdate7.text=Water levels have reached critical, %s. Hydration rations have been adjusted to\
  \ extend remaining supplies. The crew is feeling the strain, but they understand the necessity.\
  \ We're pushing forward, with all personnel adhering to updated water protocols. An adjusted ETA\
  \ of 17 hours has been communicated to all units. No further complications are anticipated.
statusUpdate8.text=%s, we just left the remains of a bombed out village. We saw children huddled\
  \ under makeshift tents, some looked up as we passed, but most didn't bother. The sight was\
  \ haunting, their small figures barely visible against the backdrop of ruin. The convoy pressed\
  \ on, each driver focused on the road, yet the mood feels hollow - like a mechanical march\
  \ through a world that's lost its meaning. There's no room for compassion here, only survival.\
  \ ETA to delivery is 18 hours, but the emptiness remains.
statusUpdate9.text=Arrived at an allied field camp recently hit by enemy 'Meks, %s. The MedTechs\
  \ were busy with fresh casualties, working swiftly in the smoky air filled with urgency. We\
  \ dropped off our supplies, before pushing ahead. The crew is visibly shaken by what they saw,\
  \ the 'Meks were using Infernos. but their focus is unbroken. We press on. ETA to delivery is 17\
  \ hours.
statusUpdate10.text=A small group of refugees tried to approach, %s, but we had to speed up for\
  \ security reasons. We're not running a charity service, after all. The crew's gone quiet again,\
  \ trying to swallow the bitter truth that survival trumps sympathy out here. The guilt is heavy.\
  \ ETA to delivery is still 18 hours, though each one feels longer than the last.
statusUpdate11.text=Stopped briefly to refuel an allied convoy, %s. The drivers looked tired, but\
  \ the handoff was quick and to the point. The convoy is back in motion, keeping pace toward the\
  \ next checkpoint. ETA to delivery remains 17 hours, with no interruptions expected.
statusUpdate12.text=%s, a woman carrying an infant waved desperately as we approached the last\
  \ village. We had nothing to give, so we kept moving. The crew tried to maintain focus, but\
  \ there's a sense of heaviness that comes with repeated exposure to scenes like this. The reality\
  \ of the situation is clear: we're here to deliver military supplies, not to play saviors. The\
  \ convoy maintains its pace, though there's a weight in my heart. ETA to delivery remains 18\
  \ hours.
statusUpdate13.text=Reached an allied checkpoint, %s. The soldiers took the supplies quietly, their\
  \ tired eyes reflecting the same exhaustion we see in each other. It's a scene we've repeated\
  \ countless times - quick exchanges under grim circumstances. We're moving on, but the mood is\
  \ heavy. The crew feels it, a sense of helplessness that lingers long after we leave each\
  \ checkpoint behind. ETA to delivery is 17 hours.
statusUpdate14.text=Recon vehicle experienced a sudden sensor glitch, %s - a brief but total blind\
  \ spot that left us vulnerable. Cause is unknown, and the crew is on edge, suspecting sabotage.\
  \ The momentary blindness felt like more than just a malfunction; it was a gap, an invitation for\
  \ disaster. The techs patched it up, but the fear of another unexpected failure lingers. We're\
  \ moving carefully, with extra scans and sensors active. ETA remains 18 hours, but the atmosphere\
  \ is heavy with paranoia.
statusUpdate15.text=Coolant levels dropped suddenly, %s, forcing an unexpected halt. Diagnostics\
  \ traced the issue to a minor breach, likely caused by a stray AC/2 round from a previous\
  \ skirmish. Techs patched it up efficiently, using reinforced seals to prevent recurrence. Crew\
  \ is alert but remains relaxed - these sorts of issues are routine in active combat zones. Extra\
  \ coolant has been distributed among vehicles, and sensors are calibrated for closer monitoring.\
  \ There's even some banter about past coolant leaks during more intense battles. Morale is\
  \ strong, and we're pushing forward without any major delays. Crew knows this is all part of the\
  \ convoy grind.
statusUpdate16.text=Fuel's dropping rapidly, %s. Rough terrain caught us off-guard, and retreating\
  \ enemy 'Meks left craters along the roads, damaging key routes. We're making adjustments to\
  \ stretch our reserves, but it's critical now. We've implemented lower-speed settings to maximize\
  \ efficiency, but that won't last if more combat breaks out. Crew's maintaining focus, with\
  \ everyone aware of the urgency. There's some chatter about potential fuel resupply options,\
  \ but we're far from any friendly base. We've sent a recon hovercraft ahead to scout for possible\
  \ emergency caches or uncharted fueling points. No delays projected yet, but the situation is\
  \ precarious. Crew's prepared for defensive actions if we encounter hostiles during fuel foraging.
statusUpdate17.text=Civilians waved us down, as we left through the last checkpoint, %s. They were\
  \ begging for medical supplies, but we didn't stop. Their disappointment was clear, but the crew\
  \ remained resolute - our orders leave no room for deviations. Morale is affected, but the\
  \ mission's priority remains unchanged. ETA to delivery is 18 hours, and the convoy maintains\
  \ operational efficiency.
statusUpdate18.text=An allied logistics unit requested spare parts, %s. The convoy maintained its\
  \ course, adhering strictly to the schedule. The crew knows the importance of keeping pace, and\
  \ there's no room for deviations. ETA to delivery is 17 hours, with no expected delays.
statusUpdate19.text=Missing fuel traced to a punctured tank, %s - likely damage from stray laser\
  \ fire during a previous skirmish. We're redistributing remaining fuel reserves across the convoy\
  \ to maintain movement. The situation is tight, but so far, no delays are projected. Crew's\
  \ prepping for possible emergency refueling if needed.
statusUpdate20.text=Located missing crates near an abandoned checkpoint, %s. Evidence suggests a\
  \ previous supply convoy came under heavy fire and had to abandon cargo during their retreat. We\
  \ secured what we could, including ammunition crates and medical supplies. Techs believe some\
  \ crates contain Class-C Coolant, which could come in useful. The team's moving steadily, though\
  \ the discovery has sparked concerns over enemy activity in the area. We've added patrols to\
  \ cover the rear in case of ambush. We'll assess the contents of the salvaged crates at the next\
  \ checkpoint. For now, we're staying cautious.
statusUpdate21.text=Blocked pass ahead, %s - fallen trees and debris, likely remnants of a recent\
  \ skirmish. Clearing it took longer than expected, with scouts maintaining a constant watch for\
  \ potential ambushes. It's a bleak routine - clearing, advancing, expecting the worst, and\
  \ finding nothing but more debris in a war that never seems to change. ETA is 17 hours, but the\
  \ convoy pushes forward more out of habit than hope.
statusUpdate22.text=Misjudged water reserves, %s, forcing us to ration supplies more tightly.\
  \ Located additional water canisters at an abandoned outpost, likely left behind during a rapid\
  \ retreat. Crew is grumbling over the reduced rations, but discipline holds. No delays are\
  \ expected for now, but the harsh conditions are affecting efficiency. We're actively searching\
  \ for other possible resupply points.
statusUpdate23.text=Came across an allied patrol running low on fuel, %s. The exchange was handled\
  \ efficiently - just a quick transfer of fuel before we both resumed our respective routes. The\
  \ convoy is back in formation, maintaining a steady pace as we push forward. ETA to delivery is\
  \ 17 hours, expecting no further delays.
statusUpdate24.text=An emergency frequency flared up briefly, %s. It sounded like a weak distress\
  \ call, likely from a downed 'MekWarrior or an old recon unit caught behind lines. Given the\
  \ risks, we didn't break formation to respond. The crew remains calm - it's not the first time\
  \ we've heard distress signals on this route. We're keeping channels open, just in case it's a\
  \ friendly in need. Morale is stable, with some light banter over the comms to maintain spirits.\
  \ No delays expected as we continue.
statusUpdate25.text=A collapsed bridge forced a route change, %s - possibly the result of sabotage.\
  \ An alternate crossing was identified, and the convoy is back on track. The delay was minimal.\
  \ All units are aware of potential risks associated with the detour, including possible ambush\
  \ points. The crew is maintaining focus. No major delays are expected as we proceed.
statusUpdate26.text=Crossed paths with allied scouts, %s. Their vehicles appeared intact, but the\
  \ scouts themselves were tense, eyes constantly scanning the horizon. ETA to delivery remains 18\
  \ hours, with no delays expected.
statusUpdate27.text=An allied logistics convoy needed basic rations, %s. The exchange was just\
  \ another handoff interaction in a war that's filled with them - brief moments of connection\
  \ between those worn down by the same relentless grind. As we move forward, the crew can't help\
  \ but feel the weight of each stop; each encounter a reminder of the endless cycle we're part of.\
  \ ETA to delivery is 17 hours.
statusUpdate28.text=Reached an allied outpost that showed clear signs of a recent skirmish, %s.\
  \ Torn sandbags, bullet holes in the walls, and soldiers with dusty uniforms greeted us. Their\
  \ focus was sharp despite the signs of battle still fresh around them. The supply handoff was\
  \ fast before we resumed our route. The crew is staying alert, eyes scanning the horizon for\
  \ potential threats. We maintain speed, knowing that vigilance is as important as delivery. ETA\
  \ to delivery remains 18 hours.
statusUpdate29.text=GPS signal cut out near a known ambush site, %s. This could be a result of\
  \ residual jamming from previous encounters. All units are proceeding with heightened caution,\
  \ maintaining full situational awareness. Sensors have been recalibrated to account for potential\
  \ interference, and the crew is prepared for ambush. No delays are expected, but all personnel\
  \ will remain on alert until we clear the area.
statusUpdate30.text=Civilians just crowded the convoy, %s, desperate for water or some such. We had\
  \ to keep moving, because "rationing" doesn't include charity drops. The crew's trying to stay\
  \ focused, but despair has a way of seeping in when you least expect it. At least we're\
  \ efficient, if not empathetic. ETA to delivery holds at 17 hours.
statusUpdate31.text=Met an allied recon team, %s. They were well-prepared, with gear in order and\
  \ weapons ready, but the fatigue was clear in their eyes. It's a burden we all share, each of us\
  \ carrying the same weariness that has become part of the mission. The encounter was brief, but\
  \ the crew feels the shared weight of it all, but the path ahead demands focus. ETA to delivery\
  \ is 17 hours, with no expected delays.
statusUpdate32.text=Saw children scavenging in the ruins of an old market as we passed, %s. It was\
  \ hard to ignore, but the crew tried their best to focus on the mission. After all, emotional\
  \ detachment is the closest thing we've got to armor these days. Spirits are low, but the convoy\
  \ maintains speed. At least the engine hum drowns out the emptiness. ETA to delivery remains 17 hours.
statusUpdate33.text=Landslides have hit the main cargo road, %s, forcing us to reroute to a path\
  \ closer to contested zones. It's a necessary risk, but one that adds to the sense of futility\
  \ - rerouting, retreating, always adapting, yet never truly advancing. It's as if the road itself\
  \ resists our passage. ETA remains at 18 hours, but the sense of inevitable confrontation looms.
statusUpdate34.text=Intercepted a faint distress signal, %s. It's weak, barely a whisper among the\
  \ static. Could be an ally trapped, or it could be a trap set by the enemy. The tone of the\
  \ signal has an eerie, desperate quality, impossible to ignore. We've opened all channels, hoping\
  \ to verify its origin, but no joy. We're proceeding cautiously, weapons primed. No delays\
  \ expected, but the air is heavy with uncertainty.
statusUpdate35.text=Civilians tried to flag us down, %s, hoping for help. We couldn't stop, as the\
  \ risk to the convoy was too great. The crew barely reacted, their expressions indifferent.\
  \ Desperate faces lingered in the rear-cam for a moment before disappearing. It's a familiar\
  \ scene - one that stirs little emotion now. Morale is low, but it doesn't hinder our progress.\
  \ ETA to delivery holds at 17 hours, with no significant delays expected.
statusUpdate36.text=A woman carrying a sick child approached the convoy, hoping for help, %s. We\
  \ had to keep moving, leaving her behind like so many others. It felt like another failure,\
  \ another weight added to the growing burden of this war. The crew fell silent, the reality of\
  \ our choices weighing heavily on everyone. It's a stark reminder of what we've become in the\
  \ name of duty - just another part of the machine, indifferent to the suffering left in its wake.\
  \ ETA to delivery is 17 hours, but the sense of loss remains.
statusUpdate37.text=Reached an allied checkpoint that had just repelled an attack, %s. The soldiers\
  \ were still on high alert, eyes scanning the surroundings for any lingering threats. We were\
  \ passed through the checkpoint quickly. ETA to delivery remains 18 hours, with all systems\
  \ nominal.
statusUpdate38.text=Dense fog has swallowed the convoy, %s, thick as smoke. Visibility is near\
  \ zero. We've seen this kind of cover before - an ideal screen for enemy ambushes. The convoy\
  \ crawls forward, engines hushed, the only sound a distant metallic clanking that seems to\
  \ come from nowhere and everywhere at once. Crew moves slowly, with every nerve on edge. Delays\
  \ are likely.
statusUpdate39.text=Came across civilians searching through debris for food, %s. They were too\
  \ exhausted to react as we passed, eyes hollow and movements slow. The sight was haunting - a\
  \ reminder of what these endless conflicts have reduced people to. The crew remained silent,\
  \ their expressions matching the somber scene outside. There was nothing we could do for them;\
  \ all we could offer was a fleeting glance of sympathy before moving on. The mood in the convoy\
  \ is heavy, and it's clear that the war is weighing on everyone. No delays expected, but the\
  \ emptiness lingers.
statusUpdate40.text=Reached an allied resupply post, %s. The soldiers were organized, moving\
  \ quickly to handle the exchange. The convoy's speed is steady. ETA to delivery is 18 hours, with\
  \ no expected delays.
statusUpdate41.text=Just passed a makeshift graveyard, %s. Civilians were burying the dead, their\
  \ faces etched with a grim acceptance of the war's toll. The convoy kept moving, the sight met\
  \ with silent indifference from the crew. There's no shock, just a dull recognition that this\
  \ conflict leaves no one untouched. ETA to delivery is 18 hours.
statusUpdate42.text=An allied MedTech unit flagged us for supplies, %s. They accepted the crates\
  \ quietly, their expressions drained but determined. It's clear that the toll of this conflict is\
  \ not just physical but mental as well. The convoy continues forward, each driver resolute,\
  \ knowing that our delivery supports those still fighting. ETA to delivery holds at 18 hours.
statusUpdate43.text=Lead vehicle experienced a sudden loss of steering, %s. Emergency repairs were\
  \ conducted swiftly by mechanics, who suspect worn cables as the root cause. The crew is\
  \ understandably cautious. We've resumed movement, maintaining full convoy integrity. Mechanics\
  \ will perform a more thorough inspection at the next scheduled stop. All personnel have been\
  \ briefed on emergency protocols, and no significant delays are anticipated.
statusUpdate44.text=Food rations came up short, %s. Inventory checks show missing supplies - either\
  \ an error or theft. There's a creeping paranoia among the crew, as if someone within our ranks\
  \ is hiding something. We're rationing what's left, but the reduced meals add a gnawing hunger.\
  \ ETA remains 18 hours, assuming no more surprises.
statusUpdate45.text=Discovered a slow fuel leak during inspection, %s. Likely caused by shrapnel\
  \ from our last skirmish with enemy BattleMeks. Techs performed a swift patch, reinforcing weak\
  \ spots. We're monitoring fuel levels more closely to ensure stability. Crew remains alert but\
  \ isn't worried - this kind of repair is par for the course. Spirits are high, with some crew\
  \ sharing stories of repairs under fire. ETA holds at 18 hours, with no expected delays, so long\
  \ as the repairs hold.
statusUpdate46.text=Cooling system failure reported on one of our cargo trucks, %s - strong\
  \ suspicion of sabotage by enemy operatives. This happened during a planned stop, making it\
  \ likely that infiltrators tampered with our systems overnight. Tech crews executed rapid field\
  \ repairs, but the incident has shaken trust among the team. We've doubled the watch and added\
  \ sensor sweeps for sabotage detection. Tension is high, especially with scout reports of\
  \ possible enemy 'Mek sightings nearby. We're continuing our push, aiming to maintain\
  \ pace, but we're ready for an engagement. ETA to the drop-off remains at 18 hours.
statusUpdate47.text=Medical kits are running low, %s, after treating minor injuries during our last\
  \ retreat. Crew is rationing remaining supplies, focusing on essentials. Despite the shortage,\
  \ there's a sense of camaraderie, with jokes about "field fixes" and toughing it out like the old\
  \ days. Resupply will be necessary soon, but for now, spirits are positive. No delays expected,\
  \ and ETA is steady at 18 hours as we press forward.
statusUpdate48.text=Civilians blocked the road, demanding supplies, %s. They left us no choice - we\
  \ had to open fire. The crew executed my orders without hesitation. There's a sense of\
  \ resignation among the team; it's just another reminder of the harsh rules that govern this war.\
  \ Morale isn't high, but no one expected it to be. The convoy continues at full speed. No delays\
  \ are expected.
statusUpdate49.text=Passed civilians getting water from a muddy stream, %s. We maintained convoy\
  \ speed. There was nothing we could offer anyway, not without compromising our own supplies.\
  \ Each decision to move forward without helping weighs heavily, but operational parameters do not\
  \ allow for deviations based on sympathy. ETA to delivery holds at 17 hours, with no anticipated\
  \ delays.
statusUpdate50.text=A young boy tried to flag us down with a piece of uniform, %s. We couldn't slow\
  \ down, so he eventually dropped his arm and watched us pass. It's the kind of scene that stings,\
  \ but we've learned to keep our eyes on the road - easier to justify when you've got orders to\
  \ follow. No delays expected, just a few more dents in whatever's left of our humanity.
statusUpdate51.text=An allied unit needed a quick resupply, %s. We're moving again. ETA to delivery\
  \ is 17 hours.
statusUpdate52.text=Lead vehicle's brakes failed, %s - quick repairs got us moving again, but the\
  \ terrain remains unforgiving. It's not just the land that wears us down; it's the unending\
  \ struggle against obstacles, both mechanical and mental. Every fix feels temporary, like a\
  \ bandage over a wound that never truly heals. Each mile feels like a testament to perseverance,\
  \ yet the point of it all seems lost in the dust behind us. ETA is 18 hours, and the convoy moves\
  \ on, because it must.
statusUpdate53.text=Children ran alongside the convoy, hoping for handouts, %s. We had nothing to\
  \ spare, so they eventually fell back. It's a hard reality, but one that we've accepted as part\
  \ of this mission. The crew remains professional, aware that stopping could jeopardize our\
  \ schedule. Every decision here is based on efficiency, not emotion. Morale may be low, but the\
  \ convoy's pace is steady. No delays expected.
statusUpdate54.text=Stopped by a group of allied scout 'Meks in need of resupply, %s. They looked\
  \ rough, armor melted to slag. The crew remains alert. ETA to delivery is 18 hours.
statusUpdate55.text=Passed a makeshift hospital, %s. Civilians lay on mats, too weak to move. We\
  \ couldn't stop, of course. The crew knows the drill: save the rations for the ones we're\
  \ supposed to help, not the ones already beyond it. There's no room for sentiment in this convoy.\
  \ ETA to delivery remains 18 hours, with spirits as low as usual.
statusUpdate56.text=Near-miss with a mine due to driver fatigue, %s. Quick reactions prevented\
  \ disaster, but it's a reminder of the toll continuous operations take. We're rotating drivers\
  \ more frequently to maintain sharpness. There's some tension, but morale remains solid -\
  \ everyone knows the stakes. Banter continues on the comms, lightening the mood despite the\
  \ scare. We're holding pace, adjusting ETA to 17 hours, and maintaining vigilance as we navigate\
  \ through the minefield.
statusUpdate57.text=Encountered a blocked pass, %s - defensive rock formations likely placed by\
  \ enemy scouts. These barriers were effectively positioned, suggesting recon units were active\
  \ here recently. We managed to clear the path using explosives, but the delay left us exposed.\
  \ Crew remains alert, scanning for potential sniper or light 'Meks lurking nearby. We're moving\
  \ through the pass slowly, given the likelihood of sensor mines or remote explosives. The\
  \ situation is tense, but we've increased sensor sweeps. Prepared to engage if enemy units\
  \ respond to our presence.
statusUpdate58.text=Civilians gathered by the roadside, %s, hoping for handouts. We moved on\
  \ quickly, because stopping for them is about as likely as finding a peaceful solution to this\
  \ whole mess. The crew's not thrilled, but they've learned that helplessness is part of the job\
  \ description. We just keep moving, like clockwork. No delays expected - just another routine day\
  \ in the logistics grind.
statusUpdate59.text=Convoy was halted by an abandoned vehicle barricade, %s. Clearing it took\
  \ longer than expected. The blockade was a remnant of a past battle, with no immediate threats\
  \ detected. Spirits are good, with jokes about finding "souvenirs" among the wreckage. We're\
  \ moving forward, keeping formation intact. ETA remains at 18 hours, with all systems nominal\
  \ and no expected delays.
statusUpdate60.text=Another sudden storm, %s. The barrage of wind can damage the vehicles, so we were\
  \ forced the crew to take cover. Comms remain active, but there's an unspoken tension - a\
  \ familiar sense of vulnerability that only adds to the weariness of war. The storm hammers the\
  \ metal with a sound that's almost mocking, a reminder of how easily even nature can break us\
  \ down. The storm should pass soon, ETA holds at 17 hours.
statusUpdate61.text=A discrepancy in the cargo manifest required a brief halt, %s. The issue has\
  \ been identified and resolved, but it added to the overall tension among the crew. Personnel\
  \ have been reminded of the importance of accuracy in supply management, and that errors can\
  \ compromise mission success. All units remain alert for any additional issues that could arise\
  \ from logistical errors. No further delays are expected.
statusUpdate62.text=Passed through a bombed-out market, %s. A few civilians were scavenging among\
  \ the rubble, their faces gaunt and eyes empty. The air felt suffocating, filled with the stale\
  \ scent of smoke and decay. Spirits are low, and the reality of the situation weighs heavy on\
  \ the convoy. We're moving forward, but it's hard to escape the sense of futility in all this\
  \ destruction. No delays.
statusUpdate63.text=Reached an allied trench that had recently been raided, %s. The soldiers were\
  \ still recovering, moving slowly as if the attack had stripped them of more than just\
  \ resources. We managed a quick resupply. But as we pushed forward, the lingering unease was hard\
  \ to shake - it's the kind of feeling that settles deep, reminding us of what we've all lost. ETA\
  \ to delivery is 18 hours.
statusUpdate64.text=Caught a loose oil hose just in time, %s. The damage suggests shrapnel, but\
  \ it's unclear when it happened. The crew managed a quick patch-up, but there's a lingering sense\
  \ that the convoy's luck is wearing thin. Every repair feels more temporary, as if the machines\
  \ themselves are giving in to age. We're maintaining speed, but no one is certain how long that\
  \ will last. No delays expected, but the sense of foreboding is tangible, like a storm building\
  \ in the distance.
statusUpdate65.text=GPS led us to a dead-end, %s - an old barricade, rusted and overgrown, yet\
  \ still sturdy enough to block our path. It feels intentional, like someone wanted to trap us\
  \ here. The crew is tense, eyes darting toward the dark woods beyond, half-expecting an attack.\
  \ We're rerouting now, trying to find a way around this obstacle, but the delay adds to the\
  \ growing anxiety. ETA is currently 18 hours, but remains uncertain.
statusUpdate66.text=Just passed some elderly civilians, %s. They watched us pass, but there was no\
  \ movement toward us - likely a sign that they've lost any expectation of help. The crew didn't\
  \ react beyond a few brief glances, understanding that this is just another facet of the war.\
  \ It's a familiar sight, one that no longer surprises. No delays expected.
statusUpdate67.text=Signs of early heat exhaustion among drivers, %s. Hydration protocols are in\
  \ effect, but the relentless engine heat is taking its toll. The crew needs a longer rest soon.\
  \ Each moment under this scorching sun feels like another step deeper into a conflict that never\
  \ ends. ETA remains at 17 hours, but the weight of exhaustion is more evident than ever.
statusUpdate68.text=%s, convoy just left a village our forces cleared out last week. Mother and\
  \ child begged for food as we passed. The crew kept moving without hesitation. This kind of scene\
  \ has become routine - an unpleasant reality we've grown accustomed to. Not everyone can be\
  \ saved, and most of us have accepted that fact. Morale's low, but it's not unexpected. There's\
  \ no room for sentiment here, just the necessity of pressing on toward the next checkpoint. No\
  \ delays expected.
statusUpdate69.text=%s, a sudden dust storm has descended on the convoy, cutting visibility to\
  \ almost nothing. The road we've been following is now obscured, swallowed by the swirling grit.\
  \ The convoy presses on. The crew is tense, scanning for signs of an ambush lurking within the\
  \ storm's cover. We're holding pace for now, but the sense of unseen eyes watching is relentless.
statusUpdate70.text=Reached an allied checkpoint, %s. The weariness in the soldiers eyes was hard\
  \ to miss. They moved with purpose, though, despite the fatigue. We're back on the move,\
  \ maintaining speed and focus. ETA to delivery holds at 18 hours.
statusUpdate71.text=Water supplies are running low faster than expected, %s. The engine heat,\
  \ combined with evasive maneuvers, has taken a toll on hydration needs. We've issued tighter\
  \ rationing protocols, but the crew is managing well, joking about old desert campaigns where\
  \ water was even scarcer. Hydration is still enough for now, but reaching the next checkpoint is\
  \ crucial. No delays are expected as we maintain course.
statusUpdate72.text=Engine overheated in Transport-3, %s. Coolant levels are critical, with\
  \ possible shrapnel damage as the cause. Repairs are underway, but the crew is anxious. They know\
  \ that any further complications could leave us stranded in contested territory. We're adjusting\
  \ the ETA to 17 hours, but it's a fragile estimate.
statusUpdate73.text=Fuel reserves are critically low, %s. The terrain has proven far more\
  \ challenging than estimated, with steep inclines and uneven surfaces. We've initiated stringent\
  \ rationing to ensure progress continues without compromising operational integrity. Drivers have\
  \ been instructed to maintain optimal speed to conserve fuel. We're exploring potential emergency\
  \ resupply points along the route, though options appear limited. No delays are expected for now.
statusUpdate74.text=Reached an allied outpost, %s, where fresh sandbags lined the perimeter. The\

statusUpdateEnemyOverwhelming31.text=%s, convoy's position in this sector was\
  \ nearly overrun during the latest push. Assault 'Meks broke through\
  \ defensive lines, forcing crews to make split-second decisions under intense\

# getCacheDescriptionDud
dudGeneric0.text=%s, we've scoured the valley below %s for hours now. The canyon walls are steep,\
  \ littered with fallen debris and old scorch marks - possibly from a %s skirmish long before our time.\
  \ Low visibility's a problem; dense fog keeps sensors from getting clean reads. We picked up faint\
  \ energy spikes three times, but each time it flickered out, almost as if it's designed to lure us\
  \ deeper. I've got a bad feeling about this place. The team's morale is dipping; some swear they\
  \ saw movement in the shadows, but I've found no tracks or heat signatures. Continuing the sweep,\
  \ but so far, no sign of the %s depot.
dudGeneric1.text=%s, we're in the eastern ridgeline now, along the edge of %s. Rain is coming down hard,\
  \ turning the ground into mud and gumming up our treads. Signal interference is off the charts -\
  \ comms are breaking up, and sensors are giving ghost returns, as if something from the %s\
  \ is jamming us. The depot's supposed coordinates have been checked twice, but all we've found are\
  \ old bunkers, stripped bare. I'm not sure if we're missing something or if the intel's bad,\
  \ but nothing here feels right. We'll push a little further before pulling back to base.
dudGeneric2.text=%s, we're at the foothills in %s, and this place is like a graveyard. Twisted metal and\
  \ wreckage from old %s 'Meks litter the ground, half-buried in snowdrifts. There's a chill in the\
  \ air that's not just the cold - the men are restless. Sensors keep pinging with minor seismic\
  \ tremors, but no sign of structures beneath the surface. I ordered a manual check, but all\
  \ we're digging up are shattered armor plates and frozen corpses. We're running low on supplies,\
  \ but I'll give it one more pass before retreating. The depot remains elusive.
dudGeneric3.text=%s, we've reached the marshlands near %s. The terrain's worse than expected;\
  \ it's a mire of sucking mud and stagnant pools, hard on the legs and the 'Meks' joints. Visibility\
  \ is near-zero - constant mist and roiling fog make thermal scans unreliable. We picked up what\
  \ might have been a burst transmission earlier, but it cut out before we could trace it back to a\
  \ possible source. The team is growing wary; strange sounds are coming from deeper in the swamp,\
  \ but no visual or sensor confirmation. It could be wildlife... or something else. No sign of the %s\
  \ cache yet.
dudGeneric4.text=%s, we've crossed the plateau and are closing in on the last set of coordinates in %s.\
  \ The high winds up here are tearing at our comms, and static is becoming a constant companion.\
  \ I've seen strange lights on the horizon - some kind of electrical discharge, maybe from old tech,\
  \ but the sensors can't make heads or tails of it. We've found more abandoned gear, some bearing\
  \ faint %s insignia, but no sign of anything functional. Morale is low, and the crew's starting to\
  \ think this depot might be nothing more than a rumor. Requesting permission to withdraw soon.
dudGeneric5.text=%s, we're moving through the deep woods in %s. Thick underbrush is slowing\
  \ our advance, and sensors are picking up strange heat anomalies, but they vanish just as quickly\
  \ as they appear. We found remnants of a resupply - old crates, half-buried in moss - but no\
  \ signs of anything more significant. The atmosphere here is heavy, and some of the crew report\
  \ hearing distorted voices over the comms, but no clear signals from a %s frequency. Still no sight\
  \ of the depot.
dudGeneric6.text=%s, we've reached the desert flats near %s. Sandstorms are fierce, creating\
  \ interference across all sensor bands. We've come across what looks like the ruins of a %s outpost,\
  \ walls partially buried in dunes, but no clear leads on the depot's location. The wind carries\
  \ a strange whistling sound, almost like a distant scream, but no signatures detected. The team\
  \ is growing weary; supplies are running thin, but we'll press on a bit longer.
dudGeneric7.text=%s, we've pushed into the rocky canyons near %s. The cliffs are steep, and\
  \ strange markings along the rock face hint at a possible local presence. However, every cave we've\
  \ searched so far has been empty, save for a few damaged scout cars with %s insignia. Scans suggest\
  \ faint energy trails deeper in, but they're erratic, almost like decoys. It's as if the depot\
  \ was never here - or has been moved elsewhere entirely.
dudGeneric8.text=%s, the swamp here in %s is a nightmare. Deep, murky waters make it nearly\
  \ impossible to maneuver, and sensors are plagued by thick bio-signatures. We found a rusted %s\
  \ DropShip hull partially submerged, but it's long dead. No signs of recent activity, no depot.\
  \ Strange lights dance across the surface of the water, but readings suggest they're natural\
  \ phenomena. The crew's resolve is wavering.
dudGeneric9.text=%s, we're in the abandoned urban sector at %s. These ruins bear %s \
  \ markings, likely from the last conflict here. Most buildings are gutted, with walls blackened by\
  \ fires. We found a few leftover data terminals, but they're too damaged to provide intel on the\
  \ depot. Sporadic sensor pings suggest faint power sources, but they're too weak to be the target.\
  \ We'll continue the sweep.
dudGeneric10.text=%s, we've arrived at the ice fields near %s. Blizzards are brutal, and the\
  \ cold is affecting our equipment. We found a partially collapsed %s bunker under the ice, but it's\
  \ been abandoned for years. A few sensor ghosts suggested movement beneath the ice sheets, but we\
  \ can't confirm if it's related to the depot. The search is feeling more futile with every passing\
  \ hour.
dudGeneric11.text=%s, we've entered the gorge in %s. It's dark and narrow, with jagged rocks\
  \ making navigation difficult. The echoes here play tricks on the sensors - everything feels off.\
  \ We located a rusted %s APC, but it's been stripped clean. Still no sign of the depot, just a lot\
  \ of eerie silence. Morale is dipping, but we'll keep moving.
dudGeneric12.text=%s, we're in the dense fog zone around %s. Visibility is nearly zero, and\
  \ our thermal scans are useless. There are remnants of a communication array here, but it's been\
  \ inactive for ages. We attempted a few broadcasts on %s frequencies, hoping for a response, but\
  \ nothing came back. The depot's location remains elusive.
dudGeneric13.text=%s, we've reached the river crossing at %s. The water is fast and deep, with\
  \ fallen %s equipment littering the banks. We tried scanning for possible underwater installations,\
  \ but the currents make it too risky for a deeper search. No depot detected. The crew is exhausted,\
  \ and the constant roar of the river is fraying nerves.
dudGeneric14.text=%s, we're combing through the craters at %s. The ground is pockmarked from past\
  \ bombardments, making traversal treacherous. We found a cache of old %s munitions, but they're\
  \ degraded beyond use. No power sources, no shelter, and certainly no depot. It's starting to feel\
  \ like a wild goose chase, but we'll give it one last push before calling it off.
dudGeneric15.text=%s, we're at the edge of the wasteland in %s. The ground here is blackened,\
  \ possibly from an earlier scorched-earth tactic. Radiation spikes occasionally flare up, throwing\
  \ off our sensors. We found scattered remains of %s recon vehicles, but the depot itself is nowhere\
  \ to be found. The deeper we go, the more desolate it becomes.
dudGeneric16.text=%s, we've entered a cavern network at %s. It's a twisting maze down here, full\
  \ of stale air and lingering darkness. We found a few %s insignias etched into the rock, but no signs\
  \ of recent activity. Sensors keep picking up false positives, likely echoes from the rocks. No depot,\
  \ no progress.
dudGeneric17.text=%s, we're deep in the ravine at %s. The ground is unstable, and minor landslides\
  \ have slowed us down. We found an old %s MekBay, buried under debris, but it's been picked clean.\
  \ No signs of life, no depot, and only the occasional creak of shifting rocks to accompany us. We're\
  \ preparing to exit the area.
dudGeneric18.text=%s, we're scanning the old mining site at %s. Rusted machinery and broken %s\
  \ loaders dot the landscape, but the depot remains elusive. The tunnels are partially collapsed,\
  \ making it too risky to venture deeper. We'll mark this location as a potential future salvage site,\
  \ but as for the %s depot, there's no trace of it here.
dudGeneric19.text=%s, we've reached the frozen ridge at %s. Snow drifts are high, and visibility\
  \ is minimal. We detected what appeared to be a %s signal burst, but it was gone before we could\
  \ triangulate its source. No depot, just more barren snowfields. The team is growing weary, and\
  \ supplies are dwindling. Requesting permission to retreat.
dudGeneric20.text=%s, we're backtracking through %s. The ground is scarred by ancient shell\
  \ craters, now filled with stagnant pools of water. It's strange - seeing the relics of battles\
  \ fought long ago, with no one left to remember what it was even for. The %s depot, if it ever existed,\
  \ is lost to time, much like the warriors who once bled for it. I fear we're searching for ghosts.
dudGeneric21.text=%s, we've reached the abandoned fortress at %s. %s emblems still adorn the\
  \ crumbling walls, faded and weathered by time. It feels more like a mausoleum than a depot now.\
  \ The corridors echo with emptiness, reminding us of those who must have once called this home. No\
  \ sign of life or supplies - only dust and the lingering sorrow of battles lost.
dudGeneric22.text=%s, we're in the overgrown ruins at %s. Nature has reclaimed the old outpost\
  \ here, vines wrapping around shattered gun emplacements and shattered buildings. We found rusted\
  \ ammo crates with %s insignia, untouched for decades. It's like searching through the remains of\
  \ a forgotten dream. I wonder if anyone even remembers why we're still looking.
dudGeneric23.text=%s, we've combed through the wasteland at %s. The ground is cracked and barren,\
  \ scorched by a %s retreat that left nothing but ash. It's as if the land itself is trying to forget\
  \ what happened here. The depot is nowhere to be found, and the crew can't shake the feeling that\
  \ our efforts mean little in the grand scheme of endless war.
dudGeneric24.text=%s, we've reached the mountain pass in %s. Snow covers the remnants of a %s\
  \ base, the white blanket making everything feel eerily peaceful, despite the chaos that must have\
  \ raged here once. No depot, only shattered bunkers and the hollow remnants of a cause that seems\
  \ distant now, even as we pursue it.
dudGeneric25.text=%s, we're in the canyon at %s. Faded %s banners still hang from some of the\
  \ rocky outcroppings, flapping gently in the wind. We found a few empty crates and a rusted comm\
  \ relay, both long since abandoned. It's clear that whatever purpose this depot once served has\
  \ been abandoned, much like the ideals that built it.
dudGeneric26.text=%s, we've reached the outskirts of an old %s encampment at %s. Everything here\
  \ feels forgotten, like a chapter left unfinished in a book no one reads anymore. There's no depot,\
  \ only the scattered remains of tents and supply crates. Sometimes I wonder if our search is driven\
  \ more by stubbornness than reason.
dudGeneric27.text=%s, we're deep in the forest at %s. The trees are thick, their branches heavy\
  \ with a quiet sadness, as if they've seen too much. We found a rusted %s Scout VTOL, fallen among\
  \ the roots. No sign of the depot, just the faint memory of battles that seemed important once,\
  \ but now feel pointless.
dudGeneric28.text=%s, we're navigating the swamps of %s. This place is a graveyard of old %s\
  \ vehicles, slowly being consumed by the mud. It's hard to say if this depot was ever real, or\
  \ just another mirage in a war full of them. The men seem tired, not just from the search, but from\
  \ the futility of finding meaning in any of this.
dudGeneric29.text=%s, we've arrived at the abandoned %s airfield in %s. The runways are cracked,\
  \ and the hangars are empty. It's a scene of a past defeat, frozen in time. We found nothing but\
  \ broken Meks and hollow shells. No depot, just the echoes of strategies that failed and lives that\
  \ were lost chasing glory.
dudGeneric30.text=%s, we've entered the trench network at %s. These %s trenches are deep, filled\
  \ with rusted weapons and faded uniforms, but no depot. The mud here is heavy, as if it's trying to\
  \ pull us down into the past with every step. It's hard not to feel like we're just retracing old\
  \ failures, destined to repeat them.
dudGeneric31.text=%s, we're among the ruins of a city in %s. The buildings are skeletal,\
  \ shadows of a once-thriving population now reduced to rubble. No %s depot, only the sadness of a city\
  \ that dreamed of prosperity but fell under the weight of war. We're finding nothing of value here,\
  \ only a lingering sense of loss.
dudGeneric32.text=%s, we've reached the fields of %s. It's a plain covered in overgrown grass\
  \ and rusting %s weapon emplacements. There's a haunting calm here, as if even nature has grown\
  \ tired of conflict. No sign of the depot, just remnants of another battle that history has all\
  \ but forgotten.
dudGeneric33.text=%s, we've arrived at the edge of a %s battlefield at %s. Scorched Meks and\
  \ shattered tanks are all that remain, their wreckage a testament to how quickly war can erase\
  \ everything. No depot in sight, just a grim reminder of how futile it all seems when the metal\
  \ stops moving.
dudGeneric34.text=%s, we've reached the lakeshore at %s. The water is still, reflecting the\
  \ gray sky above. We found a few %s ration crates near the bank, but they're long expired, much\
  \ like the hopes that once fueled this depot's creation. We're not finding anything of use, just\
  \ reminders of a war that seems determined to outlast us all.
dudGeneric35.text=%s, we're at the border of the %s encampment in %s. The camp is deserted, its\
  \ tents torn and its fires cold. I can't help but feel a deep sadness as we sift through the remnants\
  \ - once part of a grand strategy, now just meaningless fragments. No depot, only shadows of what was.
dudGeneric36.text=%s, we've reached the foothills of Sector 29-R. The landscape here is scarred by %s\
  \ artillery strikes, and the air is thick with melancholy. We found an old command post, but it's\
  \ stripped bare, like the hollow remains of hope itself. No sign of the depot, just the sense that\
  \ we're chasing something that's long since slipped away.
dudGeneric37.text=%s, we're moving through the plains at %s. We came across a %s outpost, little\
  \ more than ruins now. The wind carries a sad, empty sound, as if the land itself is mourning what\
  \ was lost here. No depot, just more evidence futility of this endless conflict.
dudGeneric38.text=%s, we're in the desert at %s. The ground is hard, and the air is heavy with\
  \ the weight of old battles. We found rusted %s Meks buried in the sand, their pilots long gone.\
  \ The depot is nowhere to be found - only silence and the feeling that every step forward is a step\
  \ deeper into the past.
dudGeneric39.text=%s, we've reached the ruins of a %s HQ at %s. The walls are covered in bullet\
  \ holes, and the floor is littered with spent casings. It's as if time itself has moved on, leaving\
  \ this place behind. No depot here, just the quiet futility of trying to hold on to something that\
  \ war has already claimed.
dudGeneric40.text=%s, we're back at %s, scanning for the fifth time. There's nothing but sand\
  \ and rocks - again. No sign of a %s depot, just the same dusty horizon we've been staring at for\
  \ hours. The crew's getting restless, and honestly, so am I. It's hard to keep pushing when it feels\
  \ like we're chasing our own shadows.
dudGeneric41.text=%s, we've entered the marshlands around %s. The mud is thick, the humidity\
  \ is unbearable, and we haven't found so much as a single %s crate. Sensors keep glitching, but\
  \ we're almost certain it's just the local wildlife messing with the readings. The men are\
  \ complaining about everything - from the mosquitoes to the mission itself. I can't blame them.
dudGeneric42.text=%s, we're trudging through the forest at %s. Every step feels the same -\
  \ trees, mud, more trees. We found an old %s sensor tower, but it's useless now, just like the\
  \ past eight hours of searching. The crew is barely responding to orders; it's like their minds\
  \ are already back at base.
dudGeneric43.text=%s, we're in %s, checking yet another empty canyon. No %s signals, no depot,\
  \ no point. I don't know what the intel team was thinking sending us here. This place is just\
  \ another dead end, and we're starting to wonder if the depot even exists.
dudGeneric44.text=%s, we're skirting the edge of an old battlefield at %s. Just more %s wreckage,\
  \ more silence, and more of the same stale air. No depot in sight, not even a hint of recent activity.\
  \ Morale is as low as I've ever seen it; half the team isn't even pretending to look anymore.
dudGeneric45.text=%s, we've reached the plains at %s. It's flat, empty, and utterly\
  \ unremarkable. We found some %s equipment scattered around, but it's just rusted junk -\
  \ nothing worth hauling back. I think we've reached the point where everyone's just going through\
  \ the motions.
dudGeneric46.text=%s, we're at the river in %s. It's too wide to cross, and the water looks as\
  \ brown as our chances of finding anything %s-related here. We've been staring at our maps for\
  \ hours, but every potential lead just seems to be another wild goose chase. No depot, just a\
  \ bunch of wet boots and wasted time.
dudGeneric47.text=%s, we're stuck in %s, waiting for the fog to clear. We've been sitting here\
  \ so long that the crew has started playing cards just to pass the time. No signals, no %s depot,\
  \ just the same old haze. I think some of the team are starting to wonder why we're even bothering.
dudGeneric48.text=%s, we're combing through the hills at %s. Nothing but rocks and more rocks.\
  \ We found a half-buried %s vehicle, but it's been picked clean - just like every other so-called\
  \ lead. The crew's too frustrated to even argue about it anymore; they just shrug and move on.
dudGeneric49.text=%s, we've entered the swamp at %s. It's all mud and stale water, and our\
  \ sensors are useless here. The %s depot was supposed to be nearby, but I'm starting to think\
  \ this whole mission is just someone's idea of a cruel joke. Morale is at rock bottom.
dudGeneric50.text=%s, we're trudging through %s again. This is our third sweep, and we've\
  \ found exactly nothing %s-related - unless you count a few rusted ammo casings. The men are\
  \ grumbling constantly, and frankly, I'm just as tired of this as they are. It feels like a waste\
  \ of time.
dudGeneric51.text=%s, we're back at %s. There's no sign of a %s depot, not even a false-positive\
  \ on the sensors. I think the crew are starting to doubt the existence of this depot entirely.\
  \ They're moving slower with each passing hour, as if the weight of futility is sinking in.
dudGeneric52.text=%s, we're in the ruins of an old %s outpost at %s. It's just more of the\
  \ same - empty shells, rusted parts, and nothing of value. The crew's too bored to even feign\
  \ interest at this point. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep up this charade.
dudGeneric53.text=%s, we're in the desert of %s. It's hot, dry, and utterly devoid of anything\
  \ useful. We've searched every likely spot for a %s depot, but it's just sand, sand, and more sand.\
  \ The team's growing tired of my orders, and I can't say I blame them.
dudGeneric54.text=%s, we're at the cliffs in %s. The terrain is rough, but what's rougher is\
  \ the lack of results. We've been looking for this %s depot for hours, and all we've got to show for\
  \ it is a few bruised egos. Morale is dragging, and so is this mission.
dudGeneric55.text=%s, we've reached %s. There's nothing here - just more empty plains and more\
  \ disappointment. The crew isn't even trying to hide their frustration anymore. This %s depot, if\
  \ it ever existed, must be laughing at us from the shadows.
dudGeneric56.text=%s, we're checking the caves at %s. These %s tunnels are as empty as our\
  \ hopes of finding anything useful. The crew's getting sick of crawling through the dirt for no\
  \ reason. At this point, I think even I'd settle for a solid lead on a canteen.
dudGeneric57.text=%s, we've reached the abandoned %s camp at %s. It's the same story as always\
  \ - empty crates, broken weapons, and nothing else. The men have stopped asking questions; they\
  \ just keep moving with a blank look in their eyes. I think this mission is breaking us slowly.
dudGeneric58.text=%s, we're back at the ridge in %s. The view's nice, but that's about it. No\
  \ depot, no %s signals, just another false lead in a series of false leads. I think I've seen this\
  \ ridge so many times, I could draw it from memory. The crew isn't even pretending to care anymore.
dudGeneric59.text=%s, we're in the marshes of %s. We've slogged through knee-deep mud for hours\
  \ with nothing to show for it. The %s depot is still just a rumor, and the crew's patience ran out\
  \ three grids ago. At this point, it feels like the mud is dragging us down more than the mission.
dudGeneric60.text=%s, we're back at %s, staring at the same rocks we saw earlier. I'm starting\
  \ to think these %s folks buried their depot in a parallel dimension. I'll check under one more\
  \ suspicious-looking pebble before we move on. Spirits are surprisingly high, though; I think the\
  \ crew's betting on who'll find the most useless piece of scrap today.
dudGeneric61.text=%s, we've hit the swamp at %s. The mud here is so thick, I think it's trying\
  \ to steal our boots. No %s depot yet, but we did find a very angry-looking toad. The crew named\
  \ it "General Sludge," and it's currently our most promising lead. Morale's good - though I think\
  \ they like the challenge of the swamp more than the mission.
dudGeneric62.text=%s, we're in the forest at %s. It's so dense that the trees must have grown to\
  \ hide something, right? So far, no luck on the %s depot, but we did find a tree with some suspicious\
  \ bark. The crew's decided to start a "Most Bizarre Discovery" contest, and the current leader is\
  \ a rock that vaguely resembles a 'Mek pilot flipping us off.
dudGeneric63.text=%s, we're in %s, still searching for that mythical %s depot. All we've found\
  \ is an ancient can of rations. The label reads "Best Before 2550," but Private Randall says\
  \ he's willing to give it a try if we get desperate. Spirits are weirdly high; it seems the absurdity\
  \ of it all is keeping everyone entertained.
dudGeneric64.text=%s, we're at %s, and it's official - this is the most boring stretch of land\
  \ in the Inner Sphere. No depot, no %s activity, just miles of nothing. The crew's taken to naming\
  \ the rocks we pass. We've got "Old Grumpy," "The Jagged Lady," and "Sir Pebbleton III" so far. At\
  \ least they're keeping busy.
dudGeneric65.text=%s, we've reached %s. We haven't found a %s depot, but we did find a very\
  \ determined squirrel trying to break into one of our ration packs. I think it might be our most\
  \ formidable opponent yet. The crew's morale is good - turns out, nothing bonds a team like trying\
  \ to outsmart wildlife.
dudGeneric66.text=%s, we're at the river in %s. Still no %s depot, but we did manage to have a\
  \ nice little "who can skim the most rocks" competition. The winner got to wear an improvised crown\
  \ made from twigs. If only %s tech was as easy to find as things to make fun of.
dudGeneric67.text=%s, we're stuck in %s again. The fog's so thick that I think I just tried to\
  \ have a conversation with a tree. We're laughing about it, though - it's not every day you mistake\
  \ a pine for your comms officer. Still no %s depot, unless it's disguised as a very stealthy squirrel.
dudGeneric68.text=%s, we're at the hills in %s. The only %s-related thing we've found is an\
  \ old helmet with a dent so big it could serve as a soup bowl. The crew's making jokes about how\
  \ the depot's probably cloaked with "super-stealth tech," a.k.a. "just plain missing."
dudGeneric69.text=%s, we've entered the swamp at %s. It's like nature's version of a bad\
  \ joke: every step is squishy, and every scan is a false alarm. No %s depot, but we did discover\
  \ that we have an impressive talent for swamp-related limericks. Spirits are oddly high,\
  \ probably because it's impossible to be sad while rhyming 'slog' with 'bog.'
dudGeneric70.text=%s, we're back at %s. I think I saw the same bush three times today - it's\
  \ either following us, or we're lost. No %s depot yet, but we think we've found "the meaning\
  \ of life" in the shape of a weirdly shaped tree root. Morale's still solid - probably because\
  \ we've all lost our minds a little bit.
dudGeneric71.text=%s, we're in the ruins at %s. Found some old %s propaganda posters that are\
  \ now being repurposed as a dartboard. No depot, but the crew's having a good laugh at the slogans\
  \ - turns out "Victory Through Perseverance" is ironically hilarious when you're lost in the middle\
  \ of nowhere.
dudGeneric72.text=%s, we're at %s in the desert. It's so hot here that we've taken to telling\
  \ "dry" jokes. You know the type: "Why don't %s depots like the desert? Because they're afraid of\
  \ being found." Spirits are surprisingly up, mostly thanks to our terrible sense of humor.
dudGeneric73.text=%s, we're at the cliffs in %s. It's rocky, dangerous, and completely devoid\
  \ of anything remotely %s-related. On the bright side, the crew discovered that yelling "Echo!"\
  \ off the cliffs is an excellent way to pass the time. No depot, but plenty of echoes to keep us\
  \ entertained.
dudGeneric74.text=%s, we've reached %s. This empty plain has become our least favorite spot,\
  \ but we did manage to build a pretty impressive sandcastle in the downtime. The crew's named it\
  \ "Fort %s," in honor of the depot we'll never find. Morale's surprisingly high - who knew building\
  \ sandcastles was so therapeutic?
dudGeneric75.text=%s, we're in the tunnels at %s. Found some %s graffiti that reads "Kilroy Was\
  \ Here." No depot, but it's nice to know we're not the first to get stuck in this mess. The crew's\
  \ taken to singing campfire songs, even without a fire. Gallows humor is the only thing keeping us\
  \ sane.
dudGeneric76.text=%s, we're at the %s camp ruins in %s. There's nothing here but busted tents\
  \ and empty cans, but the crew's decided to reenact a dramatic play about "The Depot That Never\
  \ Was." If you hear loud applause over the comms, don't be alarmed - it's just the sound of our\
  \ own despair.
dudGeneric77.text=%s, we're at the ridge in %s. I'm starting to think this whole %s depot\
  \ hunt is a cosmic joke, and we're the punchline. The crew's betting on who can find the most\
  \ absurd object out here. So far, the front-runner is a rock shaped like a duck. Spirits are still\
  \ high, probably due to the absurdity of it all.
dudGeneric78.text=%s, we're back in the marshes of %s. The mud here is trying to steal our sanity,\
  \ one boot at a time. Still no %s depot, but we did manage to build a raft from some fallen branches.\
  \ We're calling it the "WarShip Lost Cause." Morale remains shockingly good, considering the circumstances.
dudGeneric79.text=%s, we're in the ice fields at %s. We found nothing %s-related, but the crew\
  \ did discover that sliding down icy slopes is a surprisingly fun way to kill time. No depot, but\
  \ plenty of laughter. I suppose if we're going to be lost, we might as well enjoy the ride.
dudGeneric80.text=%s, we're deep in %s, surrounded by fog so thick it feels like it's alive.\
  \ The sensors keep flickering - false signals that seem to move closer, then vanish. No sign of the\
  \ %s depot, but I can't shake the feeling we're being watched. The crew is jumpy; even the slightest\
  \ sound is making us reach for weapons.
dudGeneric81.text=%s, we're in the marshlands of %s. Strange lights hover just beyond our\
  \ vision - flickering, almost playful, but gone the moment we try to focus. No %s depot, only a\
  \ growing sense of unease. It's not just the swamp; it's like the air itself is charged with\
  \ something hostile, something old.
dudGeneric82.text=%s, we've reached the forest in %s. The trees here are unnaturally silent\
  \ - no wind, no birds, not even the rustle of leaves. We found a rusted %s 'Mek half-buried in\
  \ the ground, its cockpit open and empty. The crew swears they heard whispers coming from inside,\
  \ but the scanners showed nothing.
dudGeneric83.text=%s, we're at %s, exploring what seems to be a forgotten %s bunker. The walls\
  \ are covered in strange, indecipherable marks, as if scratched by claws. We detected faint heat\
  \ signatures earlier, but they disappeared without a trace. The men are scared - some say they've\
  \ seen shadows that move when no one else does.
dudGeneric84.text=%s, we're back at %s. We found a clearing littered with %s remains - helmets,\
  \ scattered bones, and rusted weapons. The strange thing is, there's no record of a battle here. No\
  \ depot, but an unsettling feeling that we're standing in a place where something awful happened,\
  \ something not recorded in the history books.
dudGeneric85.text=%s, we're in the plains of %s. There's a strange hum in the air - low,\
  \ constant, and impossible to trace. It's unsettling, like the sound is coming from the ground\
  \ itself. No sign of a %s depot, but the crew's starting to act strangely. Some are whispering to\
  \ themselves, claiming they hear voices beneath the hum.
dudGeneric86.text=%s, we're at the river in %s. The water's surface is black and still, reflecting\
  \ only darkness. We saw strange ripples earlier, like something large moving beneath, but no signs\
  \ of life or %s tech. The crew is spooked - one of the men claims he saw eyes staring up from the\
  \ depths, but they were gone in an instant.
dudGeneric87.text=%s, we're stuck in %s, waiting for the fog to lift. But this isn't normal fog\
  \ - it's cold, dense, and seems to pulse as if breathing. No %s depot, just a chilling sense that\
  \ something here doesn't want us to leave. Even the comms are full of static, but every now and\
  \ then, there's a faint voice in the interference.
dudGeneric88.text=%s, we're in the hills of %s. We came across a %s campsite that looks recent,\
  \ but scans indicate it's been abandoned for decades. There's dried blood on the ground, but no bodies.\
  \ The men are nervous, saying it feels like we've stepped into a place trapped between times.
dudGeneric89.text=%s, we're in the swamp at %s. There's an eerie stillness here, like the world\
  \ is holding its breath. Strange shapes drift in and out of the mist, but disappear when we approach.\
  \ No %s depot, just an overwhelming sense that we're trespassing somewhere we shouldn't be.
dudGeneric90.text=%s, we're pushing through %s, and the fog here is unnaturally dense,\
  \ almost suffocating. Sensors are erratic, picking up strange energy spikes - like a signature, then\
  \ gone. No sign of the %s depot, but there's been talk among the crew about a shape in the mist.\
  \ They say it looked like a Marauder, pitch-black, watching from the edge of visibility before\
  \ vanishing into the haze. The men are spooked. Even the air feels colder, like a warning. We're\
  \ staying alert, but it feels like we're not alone in this cursed place.
dudGeneric91.text=%s, we're in the ruins of %s. The buildings are hollowed out, but there's\
  \ a persistent sound of distant footsteps echoing from the empty corridors. We've searched thoroughly\
  \ - no %s depot, but it feels like we're being stalked by something unseen, something that knows\
  \ this place better than we do.
dudGeneric92.text=%s, we're in the desert at %s. It's as silent as a tomb out here, save for\
  \ the occasional gust that sounds like a faint whisper. No %s depot, but we keep hearing strange\
  \ noises - like metal grinding, far off but distinct. The crew's on edge; even the bravest are\
  \ keeping their weapons drawn.
dudGeneric93.text=%s, we're at the cliffs in %s. We found a %s observation post built into\
  \ the rock, but it's abandoned and smells of decay. There's a weird marking on the wall - a symbol\
  \ we don't recognize, as if it was burned into the stone itself. No depot, just a sense that we're\
  \ being watched from the shadows.
dudGeneric94.text=%s, we've reached %s. The plain stretches endlessly, but we found a single %s\
  \ helmet lying in the grass. It's polished, unnaturally clean, almost as if it was left here recently.\
  \ The crew is spooked; some say it's bait, others think it's a warning. The air feels thick with\
  \ something unseen.
dudGeneric95.text=%s, we're in the tunnels at %s. They're dark and damp, but it's the sounds\
  \ that are the worst - scraping, scratching, and the occasional echo of something that doesn't\
  \ belong. We've found no signs of a %s depot, only unsettling noises and shadows that seem to move\
  \ on their own.
dudGeneric96.text=%s, we're at the ruins of the %s camp in %s. It's silent, too silent, like\
  \ everything here was drained of life. The crew claims to see figures at the edges of their vision\
  \ - always gone when they turn. No depot, just the overwhelming feeling that something dark lingers\
  \ here, unseen but present.
dudGeneric97.text=%s, we're back at the ridge in %s. We found a small %s structure, barely\
  \ standing, with a door that opened on its own. No one can explain it, and no one wants to go inside.\
  \ The crew's getting paranoid; some are talking about "the spirits of the lost," and I can't even\
  \ laugh it off.
dudGeneric98.text=%s, we're in the marshes at %s. It's dark now, and there are strange, distant\
  \ lights floating over the water. We've tried to approach, but they vanish before we can get close.\
  \ No %s depot, just a feeling of dread that's settled over the team. The silence is broken only by\
  \ occasional distant cries, almost human.
dudGeneric99.text=%s, we're in the ice fields at %s. It's bitterly cold, but the strangest part\
  \ is the whispers - faint, almost unintelligible, but unmistakable. They seem to come from nowhere\
  \ and everywhere at once. No %s depot, just a haunting reminder that some places weren't meant to\
  \ be found.

dudStarLeague0.text=%s, we've reached what remains of an old SLDF supply depot at %s. The facility\
  \ is mostly rubble now, scorched during the Amaris Coup. Some of the walls still bear the blast marks\
  \ from Kerensky's siege. Sensors picked up faint power readings - remnants of long-dead systems\
  \ trying to hum back to life. No clear signs of functional tech or the rumored Star League cache,\
  \ just the bitter scent of decay. The air feels heavy, as if the ghosts of those last, desperate\
  \ defenders linger. The crew's nerves are fraying; some say they hear echoes of distant gunfire in\
  \ the wind. We're proceeding with caution.
dudStarLeague1.text=%s, we're at the ruins of a Terran Hegemony installation in %s, buried deep\
  \ in the forest. This base was one of the last to fall during the Amaris Coup. The bunker entrance\
  \ is blocked by debris, likely the result of self-destruct protocols triggered by the SLDF. The air\
  \ inside is stale and cold, and a few of the men claim to have seen faint blue lights flickering in\
  \ the corridors - emergency systems that shouldn't have power after two centuries. No Star League\
  \ artifacts uncovered yet, but something about this place feels alive... and hostile.
dudStarLeague2.text=%s, we've reached a massive, half-collapsed SLDF logistics hub in %s. The\
  \ place is eerie - massive hangars filled with rows of rusted unusable 'Mek parts, abandoned when\
  \ Kerensky ordered the Exodus. Old bloodstains still mark the walls, silent witnesses to the final\
  \ chaos of the Hegemony's collapse. The crew's on edge; sensors are giving off strange interference,\
  \ as if something in the wreckage is trying to communicate. No confirmed depot yet, just a lingering\
  \ feeling of betrayal, as if the past itself resents our intrusion.
dudStarLeague3.text=%s, we're deep inside a crumbling SLDF command center at %s. The central\
  \ hall is filled with the dusty remains of command consoles, likely used during Kerensky's final\
  \ campaigns against Amaris. The walls are covered with screens still showing deployments from the\
  \ last days of the Star League. Scanners picked up encrypted data bursts - ancient transmissions,\
  \ perhaps, looping endlessly since the coup. Some of the crew refuse to enter the deeper halls,\
  \ saying the air is too cold, too full of dread. No depot detected, but this place feels like a tomb.
dudStarLeague4.text=%s, we've reached what seems to be an abandoned SLDF weapons cache in %s.\
  \ The structure is intact, but something feels off. There's a persistent, low hum that's hard to\
  \ pinpoint, as if the building itself is resonating with some hidden energy. The crew's uneasy -\
  \ one of the men swears he saw a figure in an old SLDF uniform, though scans show no life signs.\
  \ This site fell during one of Kerensky's final assaults; it's said the defenders knew they were\
  \ doomed, but fought to the last anyway. No Star League tech uncovered yet, only the eerie sense\
  \ that something from those days never left.
dudStarLeague5.text=%s, we're inside the remains of an old SLDF research outpost at %s. The\
  \ labs are silent, littered with debris and the scent of decay. The facility fell during the Amaris\
  \ Coup, and the walls seem to resonate with the last desperate moments of the defenders. No depot\
  \ found, only the unsettling stillness that makes even the bravest among us hesitate. It's as if\
  \ the ghosts of Star League's failures linger here, watching.
dudStarLeague6.text=%s, we've reached what was once a Terran Hegemony garrison in %s. The\
  \ structures are in ruins, collapsed during Kerensky's final retribution. The crew senses something\
  \ here - a presence, perhaps, or just the oppressive weight of defeat. No sign of a Star League depot,\
  \ only a gnawing feeling of dread. Some of the men are muttering that LosTech sites like these are\
  \ cursed, best left undisturbed.
dudStarLeague7.text=%s, we're standing outside a sealed bunker at %s. The door is massive,\
  \ reinforced, and covered in scorched marks - likely from Amaris's forces trying to breach it.\
  \ It's silent here, deathly so, and the air feels unnaturally cold. We haven't found anything of\
  \ value yet, just a sense that we're trespassing on a battlefield lost long ago. The men say this\
  \ place is cursed, that the tech within is better left untouched.
dudStarLeague8.text=%s, we're in the wreckage of an old SLDF airfield at %s. The winds howl\
  \ through empty hangars, carrying a faint, distant sound that's hard to identify. The site has been\
  \ abandoned since the Exodus, and it feels like the memories of that era still haunt the place. No\
  \ sign of a depot, just whispers in the wind - if one believes in such things. The crew's spirits\
  \ are sinking; they say the place feels cursed, as if the very ground rejects us.
dudStarLeague9.text=%s, we're exploring the charred remains of an SLDF staging ground at %s. The\
  \ buildings are gutted, the walls blackened by fire and riddled with bullet holes. We haven't\
  \ uncovered any signs of a depot, only the remnants of a brutal last stand. Some of the crew believe\
  \ that sites like this one are haunted, cursed by Amaris' hate and by those who fought for a cause\
  \ that ultimately failed.
dudStarLeague10.text=%s, we've reached a ruined SLDF bunker in %s. The entrance is half-collapsed,\
  \ its steel door twisted beyond recognition. The interior is dark, and our lights barely penetrate\
  \ the dense shadows within. We haven't found anything yet, but the feeling of being watched is\
  \ stronger than ever. The men are convinced that the depot, if it exists, is cursed - like all lost\
  \ Star League secrets.
dudStarLeague11.text=%s, we're in a decrepit SLDF command center at %s. The silence here is thick,\
  \ broken only by the occasional drip of water from the ceiling. No depot in sight, just rows of\
  \ dead consoles that once controlled mighty armies. The crew's uneasy - some say this place feels\
  \ alive, like it's waiting for something. The darkness here feels tangible, and the whispers of a\
  \ cursed past are hard to ignore.
dudStarLeague12.text=%s, we've reached a derelict SLDF outpost in %s. The base is eerily quiet,\
  \ save for the creaking of old metal in the wind. We haven't seen any signs of a depot, only the\
  \ oppressive remnants of a battle long lost. The crew is growing paranoid, claiming to hear footsteps\
  \ behind them when no one's there. They say the tech here is cursed, echoing the despair of those\
  \ who never made it out.
dudStarLeague13.text=%s, we're at what appears to be a forgotten SLDF logistics hub at %s. The\
  \ facility is massive, but most of it is inaccessible, sealed off behind collapsed walls and twisted\
  \ beams. No depot yet, only dark hallways that seem to stretch endlessly. The men are on edge, as\
  \ if the very shadows are moving around them. Some whisper that sites like this are haunted by the\
  \ cursed remnants of the past, a warning to those who seek what's been lost.
dudStarLeague14.text=%s, we're inside the crumbling remains of an SLDF stronghold at %s. The\
  \ air here is cold, with a strange metallic tang that clings to the back of the throat. We've\
  \ searched for hours, but no depot has been found. The crew is jumpy, saying that places like this\
  \ are cursed - trapped in time, haunted by the failure of a once-great Star League. The walls\
  \ themselves seem to hum with an eerie energy.
dudStarLeague15.text=%s, we're exploring a massive SLDF command center in %s. The facility is\
  \ vast and filled with empty command consoles that haven't seen use since Kerensky's Exodus. No\
  \ depot has been found, only a suffocating sense of dread. The crew swears they hear faint whispers\
  \ coming from the dark corners of the room, like distant voices that shouldn't exist. It feels like\
  \ the cursed legacy of the Star League is all that remains here.
dudStarLeague16.text=%s, we've reached the ruins of an SLDF fortress at %s. The exterior is\
  \ pitted with craters from heavy bombardment, likely from Amaris's forces. We've found no depot,\
  \ but the place feels heavy with a sense of old anger and betrayal. The men say the darkness here\
  \ is unnatural, that cursed tech lies somewhere deeper within, waiting to ensnare anyone foolish\
  \ enough to seek it.
dudStarLeague17.text=%s, we're inside an abandoned SLDF listening post at %s. It's been dead\
  \ silent, save for occasional pings on our sensors that vanish without explanation. No depot has\
  \ been located yet, but some of the crew claim they've seen shadows moving in the reflection of\
  \ the old radar screens. They say this place is cursed - haunted by the Star League's failures.
dudStarLeague18.text=%s, we're in the depths of a ruined SLDF research lab at %s. The air is\
  \ stale and tinged with a strange, acrid smell that makes breathing difficult. We've found nothing\

  \ muttering about the cursed legacy of LosTech, saying it's tainted by the ghosts of those who\
  \ tried to wield it.
dudStarLeague19.text=%s, we've reached the edge of an SLDF encampment in %s. The camp is empty,\
  \ save for the rusted remains of tents and barricades. No depot in sight, only a pervasive sense of\
  \ doom that seems to cling to everything here. The men are convinced the site is cursed, as if the\
  \ ghosts of the Star League's final defenders are still here, trying to keep us from uncovering their\
  \ secrets.
dudStarLeague20.text=%s, we're inside the ruins of an SLDF testing facility at %s. The labs are\
  \ silent, filled with broken equipment and shattered glass. We haven't found any signs of a depot,\
  \ only a chilling emptiness. The crew is growing uneasy, saying that cursed LosTech haunts this\
  \ place, keeping it lost for a reason. It feels as if the shadows themselves want to swallow us whole.
dudStarLeague21.text=%s, we're at what remains of an SLDF command post in %s. The place is a shell\
  \ of its former glory - crumbling walls covered in faded insignias. No depot in sight, just a sense\
  \ of abandonment. It's hard not to feel the weight of what's been lost here; it's as if the dreams\
  \ of the Star League withered alongside the men who died defending it. We keep moving, but the\
  \ futility of it all is beginning to sink in.
dudStarLeague22.text=%s, we're at the ruins of a once-thriving SLDF logistics hub in %s. Empty\
  \ storage bays stretch for miles, now home only to dust and silence. No depot, only the echo of a\
  \ once-unified Inner Sphere that fell apart under its own ambitions. The crew moves slowly, as if\
  \ the sadness of the place has seeped into their bones. We press on, but it feels like chasing a\
  \ lost cause.
dudStarLeague23.text=%s, we're trudging through an old SLDF garrison at %s. The barracks are\
  \ empty, the bunks still neatly made, as if waiting for soldiers who will never return. No depot\
  \ found, only a profound stillness that feels like grief itself. The men seem quieter here, as\
  \ if even speaking aloud would disturb the lingering sorrow of an era that died here long before us.
dudStarLeague24.text=%s, we've reached a ruined SLDF hospital in %s. The halls are lined with\
  \ empty beds and broken medical equipment, remnants of a time when the Star League tried to heal\
  \ rather than destroy. No depot, just the feeling that those who were abandoned here never truly\
  \ left. The sense of futility is overwhelming - war promises glory, but it seems to leave only ghosts.
dudStarLeague25.text=%s, we're at an SLDF communications center in %s. The consoles are dead,\
  \ covered in layers of dust. We haven't found the depot, just rows of silent screens that once\
  \ coordinated fleets and armies across the stars. Now, they're just relics of ambition gone cold,\
  \ a reminder that even the greatest empires can crumble into irrelevance.
dudStarLeague26.text=%s, we're inside a derelict SLDF armory at %s. The halls are filled with\
  \ empty racks where weapons once stood ready to defend the ideals of the Star League. No depot in\
  \ sight, only a feeling of profound loss. The crew seems weighed down by the futility of finding\
  \ anything of value here - it's like searching through the ashes of hope itself.
dudStarLeague27.text=%s, we're in a deserted SLDF command center at %s. The battle maps still\
  \ cover the walls, detailing campaigns that are now just faded memories. No depot has been found,\

  \ nothing. The crew's morale is sinking; it's hard to stay hopeful when every step seems to echo\
  \ with failure.
dudStarLeague28.text=%s, we're among the ruins of an SLDF outpost in %s. The outpost was likely\
  \ abandoned during Kerensky's final campaigns, its defenders leaving behind only silent halls and\
  \ unanswered questions. No depot found, only a sense of regret that lingers in the air. It's as if\
  \ the ghosts of those who once stood here are still waiting for orders that will never come.
dudStarLeague29.text=%s, we're at the remnants of a once-mighty SLDF fortress in %s. The walls\
  \ are cracked, and the turrets are silent. No depot, just the feeling of a grand dream that was\

  \ like sifting through the ruins of lost ideals. The hope of finding something meaningful is fading\
  \ fast.
dudStarLeague30.text=%s, we're in the ruins of an SLDF headquarters at %s. The command table\
  \ stands empty, as if waiting for leaders long dead. No depot found, just a sense of lost authority.\
  \ The crew is silent, perhaps out of respect for the failed ambitions that echo through these walls.\
  \ It's hard not to wonder if we're just repeating history - fighting for something that doesn't\
  \ even matter anymore.
dudStarLeague31.text=%s, we're inside an abandoned SLDF research facility at %s. The labs are\
  \ empty, their experiments long forgotten. No depot has been uncovered, only the faded symbols of\

  \ graveyard of forgotten dreams, a testament to the futility of trying to hold onto power through\
  \ war.
dudStarLeague32.text=%s, we're at an SLDF barracks in %s. The beds are unmade, as if the\
  \ soldiers left in a hurry, never to return. No depot has been found, only the oppressive silence\
  \ of lives cut short by battles that couldn't be won. The crew is tired; each room we enter feels\
  \ like stepping into another sad story that has no ending.
dudStarLeague33.text=%s, we're exploring a hollow SLDF outpost at %s. The corridors are dark,\
  \ and the only sound is the wind howling through broken windows. No depot located, only a lingering\
  \ sense of despair from those who once thought they were fighting for a better future. The crew's\
  \ morale is fading - it's hard to believe in glory when all you find are ruins.
dudStarLeague34.text=%s, we're at the crumbling remains of an SLDF citadel in %s. The\
  \ structure was once a symbol of Star League power, now reduced to rubble by time and war. No\
  \ depot here, just the melancholy of lost grandeur. The crew is quiet, as if the realization has\
  \ set in that we're searching for something that died long ago.
dudStarLeague35.text=%s, we're inside an abandoned SLDF hangar at %s. The bay doors are rusted\
  \ shut, and the air smells stale. No depot has been found, only the empty spaces where war machines\
  \ once stood ready. The crew seems haunted by the thought that everything we're searching for might\
  \ just be echoes of an era that was doomed from the start.
dudStarLeague36.text=%s, we've reached the remains of an SLDF command hub in %s. The control\
  \ room is filled with shattered monitors and scattered paperwork - records of battles that ended\
  \ in failure. No depot in sight, only the realization that even the most organized plans can end\
  \ in chaos. The men's spirits are low; this place feels like a monument to the futility of trying\
  \ to control the uncontrollable.
dudStarLeague37.text=%s, we're inside an old SLDF depot at %s, but it's long abandoned. The\
  \ crates are empty, and the walls bear the marks of hasty retreat. No depot found, only the\
  \ remnants of what might have been a grand storehouse of power. The crew's mood is bleak; the\
  \ feeling here is one of missed opportunities, of efforts that ultimately amounted to nothing.
dudStarLeague38.text=%s, we're in the hollow halls of an SLDF citadel at %s. The banners of\
  \ the Star League still hang, tattered and faded. No depot has been found, only the sad remnants\

  \ feels like we're walking through a graveyard of ideals that were doomed from the start.
dudStarLeague39.text=%s, we're at the edge of an old SLDF supply base in %s. The base is silent,\

  \ might never have existed in the first place - just another sad chapter in a history of broken\
  \ promises.
dudStarLeague40.text=%s, we're inside the remains of an old SLDF command bunker at %s. It's pitch\
  \ dark, and our lights don't seem to penetrate the shadows well. There's a strange, rhythmic sound\
  \ - almost like a heartbeat - coming from somewhere deep below. No sign of the depot, but the air\
  \ feels heavy, oppressive. Some of the crew say they can hear faint whispers, but there's no one\
  \ else here.
dudStarLeague41.text=%s, we've reached %s, where the ruins of an SLDF staging post lie in eerie\
  \ silence. The walls are covered in strange markings - perhaps scrawled by soldiers during the final\

  \ a pervasive sense of dread, like the shadows are watching us.
dudStarLeague42.text=%s, we're at an abandoned SLDF fort in %s. The halls echo with distant\
  \ clanging, even though we've confirmed there's no one else here. Some of the crew are getting\

  \ are trying to expel us.
dudStarLeague46.text=%s, we've reached %s, at the remnants of an SLDF barracks. The bunks are\
  \ still made, as if expecting soldiers to return, but there's no sign of life. Some of the crew\
  \ claim to hear footsteps in the halls, heavy and deliberate, but there's no one there. No depot,\
  \ only an overwhelming sense of being unwelcome.
dudStarLeague47.text=%s, we're at an SLDF forward base in %s. The air is thick with a strange\
  \ metallic scent, and the walls are stained with a dark, rusty substance. We haven't found the\

  \ few refuse to go deeper into the base.
dudStarLeague48.text=%s, we're exploring an SLDF airfield at %s. The hangars are empty, but\
  \ we've been hearing faint, distant cries - like the sound of pilots calling for evac that never\

  \ who died without hope. No depot found, just unsettling echoes that refuse to die.
dudStarLeague49.text=%s, we're in the ruins of an SLDF intelligence center at %s. It's dark\

  \ that makes every step feel like a mistake.
dudStarLeague50.text=%s, we're at %s, in what was once an SLDF hospital. The walls are smeared\

  \ that echo from nowhere.
dudStarLeague53.text=%s, we're inside a collapsed SLDF depot at %s. The walls are covered in\

  \ seem to watch us with a mix of hope and disappointment. No depot yet, but the crew is visibly\
  \ humbled by his enduring legacy.
dudStarLeague86.text=%s, we're inside an old SLDF headquarters at %s. The central command table\
  \ still bears the symbol of Kerensky's forces. It feels like a memorial to a lost era, a silent\
  \ tribute to the man who led the Exodus. No depot found, only a sense of duty to honor what he\
  \ stood for - even in failure.
dudStarLeague87.text=%s, we're at an SLDF training camp in %s. The crew stumbled upon an old\
  \ insignia bearing the motto: "Strength through unity." No depot in sight, but the words seem\
  \ to echo through the empty halls, a reminder of the ideals that died when the Star League fell\
  \ apart.
dudStarLeague88.text=%s, we're exploring a remote SLDF bunker at %s. The walls are covered in\
  \ graffiti from soldiers who once served under Kerensky, some of it pleading for his return. No\
  \ depot found, only a lingering sense of loyalty that stretches across the centuries.
dudStarLeague89.text=%s, we're at an SLDF comms station in %s. The crew found a plaque\
  \ commemorating Kerensky's victory over Amaris, now rusted and nearly unreadable. No depot, just\
  \ the remnants of glory that faded with his departure. The men are unusually quiet, as if they can\
  \ feel the weight of Kerensky's unfulfilled dream.
dudStarLeague90.text=%s, we're in an abandoned SLDF outpost at %s. Half written letters to family\
  \ lie scattered, a quick look through them speaks to a time of war, a desire to return to peace,\
  \ and fear of the coming war to retake Terra. No depot, just a haunting sense of apprehension that\
  \ still clings to the air, as if even the General's followers were unsure of their fate.
dudStarLeague91.text=%s, we're in an SLDF barracks at %s. The crew found a dusty old portrait\
  \ of Kerensky, half-covered by fallen debris. His gaze seems to pierce through the centuries, a\
  \ silent witness to the search that continues long after his departure. No depot, just a deep sense\
  \ of loss.
dudStarLeague92.text=%s, we're at an SLDF armory in %s. The walls bear the symbol of Kerensky's\
  \ command - now faded, but still potent. No depot located, but the feeling of walking in the footsteps\
  \ of the General is unmistakable. The crew feels a mix of inspiration and sadness, as if the weight\
  \ of history itself is upon them.
dudStarLeague93.text=%s, we're inside an SLDF depot at %s. The base's main hall has a mural\
  \ dedicated to Kerensky's final speech before the Exodus. It's faded, but the words still carry weight.\
  \ No depot found, only a sense of melancholy as we realize that his dream of unity is more distant\
  \ than ever.
dudStarLeague94.text=%s, we're at an SLDF memorial site in %s. The plaque here reads: "For General\
  \ Kerensky - last hope of the Star League." No depot located, but the crew is unusually somber, as\
  \ if the place itself demands respect. It's a painful reminder that even the greatest leaders\
  \ couldn't prevent the collapse.
dudStarLeague95.text=%s, we're in the ruins of an SLDF command center at %s. The central console\
  \ still bears the symbol of Kerensky's forces, now corroded but visible. No depot here, just the\
  \ feeling that we're walking among the last vestiges of a legacy that ultimately led to self-exile.
dudStarLeague96.text=%s, we're at an SLDF base in %s. The crew found a handwritten note from one\
  \ of Kerensky's officers, addressed to "the General" and left unfinished. No depot found, only the\
  \ lingering sense of promises unfulfilled. The team is subdued, as if they're feeling the weight\
  \ of a history that never had a happy ending.
dudStarLeague97.text=%s, we're inside an old SLDF staging area at %s. The base is filled with\
  \ broken gear, but there's a large mural of Kerensky in the main hall, now barely recognizable. No\
  \ depot located, only a profound sense of reverence for the man who once led these soldiers.
dudStarLeague98.text=%s, we're at an SLDF fort in %s. The crew discovered an old battle standard\
  \ bearing Kerensky's name, untouched for centuries. No depot, but the sense of honor and loss is\
  \ overwhelming. It's hard not to feel like we're chasing the remnants of a dream that died with him.
dudStarLeague99.text=%s, we're in an SLDF depot at %s. There's a statue of Kerensky here, toppled\
  \ and broken. It's a painful sight, a symbol of the Star League's fall and the General's departure.\
  \ No depot found, only the reminder that his vision, though noble, couldn't prevent the inevitable\
  \ collapse.

  \ technology; it's a piece of history tied directly to the SLDF's final days. My associates are\
  \ eager to secure its exact location and will provide a generous payment in C-bills for this\
  \ information. Refusal, however, could lead to increased interest from other, less diplomatic parties.

  \ interested in its coordinates, especially due to its rumored connection to the SLDF's legacy.\
  \ We are prepared to offer an immediate transfer of C-bills in return. Keeping such a discovery\
  \ secret carries its own risks. Accepting our terms ensures both financial security and the avoidance\
  \ of complications.
proposition3.text=%s, I commend your efforts in locating the Star League depot, a site potentially\
  \ linked to the SLDF's lost glory. We propose a straightforward exchange: a significant amount of\
  \ C-bills for the depot's coordinates. Refusing this offer may attract the attention of others who\
  \ are less inclined toward negotiation. Accept the funds, and avoid unnecessary complications.
proposition4.text=%s, consider this a final offer concerning the Star League depot. We can provide a\
  \ substantial amount of C-bills in exchange for its location, particularly given its rumored ties\
  \ to the SLDF. Refusal could invite scrutiny from factions less concerned with diplomacy. A quick,\
  \ discreet transaction benefits both sides. Choose wisely, as time is limited.
proposition5.text=%s, the Star League depot you're pursuing is of significant interest to my associates,\
  \ particularly due to its potential ties to the SLDF's storied history. We are ready to transfer a\
  \ considerable sum of C-bills in exchange for its exact location. This offer is both discreet and\
  \ beneficial. However, failing to respond could attract less favorable attention from other factions.
proposition6.text=%s, I must reiterate the urgency of securing the Star League depot's coordinates. It\
  \ holds immense strategic and historical value, particularly for those who respect the SLDF's legacy.\
  \ My principals are prepared to make a swift, substantial payment in C-bills. Be aware that delaying\
  \ could draw interest from parties who might not negotiate as fairly.
proposition7.text=%s, I represent a group that considers the Star League depot, and any links to the SLDF,\
  \ to be invaluable. We offer a generous sum of C-bills for its coordinates. This is an opportunity\
  \ to secure immediate resources. A refusal could, however, alter the nature of future negotiations\
  \ - possibly not to your advantage.
proposition8.text=%s, we both know the Star League depot has implications beyond mere salvage. It's a\
  \ relic of the SLDF's strength and influence. We are ready to provide a significant transfer of\
  \ C-bills for its location. Consider this a strategic alliance. Declining may invite attention\
  \ from those who prefer force over finance.
proposition9.text=%s, the Star League depot represents more than just lost technology; it's a piece of\
  \ SLDF heritage. My associates wish to acquire its location and will provide immediate compensation\
  \ in C-bills. Refusal to cooperate could have broader implications for your operations, especially\
  \ if others decide to pursue this more aggressively.
proposition10.text=%s, the Star League depot holds more than just salvage - it holds history, specifically\
  \ that of the SLDF. We are prepared to offer a substantial sum of C-bills in exchange for its\
  \ precise location. Declining this offer may lead to less pleasant inquiries from other interested\
  \ factions. The choice is yours, but time is running short.
proposition11.text=%s, your pursuit of the Star League depot has reached the attention of those who\
  \ hold the SLDF in high regard. We wish to negotiate the exchange of its coordinates for C-bills.\
  \ The offer is fair, immediate, and advantageous. A refusal could complicate matters with parties\
  \ more focused on the depot's strategic value than on monetary compensation.
proposition12.text=%s, securing the location of the Star League depot is of paramount importance to my\
  \ principals, particularly given its ties to the SLDF's legacy. We offer substantial C-bills for\
  \ this information, with no strings attached. However, withholding the location could lead to\
  \ unexpected confrontations from other interested parties.
proposition13.text=%s, the Star League depot is of immense value to my associates, especially given its\
  \ historical link to the SLDF. We propose a significant sum of C-bills for the coordinates. Be\
  \ aware that delays or refusals could prompt actions from less patient factions. Your cooperation\
  \ ensures both profit and peace.
proposition14.text=%s, the Star League depot's connection to the SLDF is well understood by my principals.\
  \ We offer a substantial transfer of C-bills in exchange for its location. Declining may draw\
  \ interest from other factions with fewer concerns about diplomacy and more about possession.
proposition15.text=%s, the Star League depot you seek is a critical piece of SLDF history. We are\
  \ prepared to offer immediate compensation in C-bills for its coordinates. Be aware that others\
  \ may soon seek it by force, making this offer one of the safer paths forward.
proposition16.text=%s, the Star League depot holds vital historical insights related to the SLDF's past.\
  \ We are interested only in the coordinates and will offer C-bills in return. It's a straightforward\
  \ transaction, but declining it may lead to a more aggressive pursuit from other factions.
proposition17.text=%s, the Star League depot is of significant interest due to its ties to the SLDF's\
  \ final days. We wish to acquire the coordinates and are prepared to offer a considerable sum of\
  \ C-bills. Your cooperation ensures a smooth exchange. Refusal could, however, attract the wrong\
  \ kind of attention.
proposition18.text=%s, I represent a group deeply invested in Star League history, specifically that of\
  \ the SLDF. We propose a discreet exchange of C-bills for the depot's location. Declining this\
  \ offer could complicate your current mission, as others may choose a more direct approach.
proposition19.text=%s, the Star League depot's link to the SLDF makes it uniquely valuable. My principals\
  \ are prepared to offer a generous sum of C-bills for its coordinates. Accepting ensures mutual\
  \ benefit, while refusal could draw the interest of parties less inclined toward peaceful negotiations.
proposition20.text=%s, some things are not meant to be found - yet here you are, on the trail of a Star\
  \ League depot tied to the SLDF. We seek its location and offer C-bills in exchange. This knowledge\
  \ is not without its burdens, but the rewards can be... enlightening. Choose wisely.
proposition21.text=%s, the past holds many secrets, as does the Star League depot you seek. We are\
  \ prepared to transfer C-bills for its coordinates, but understand: knowledge can bring shadows.\
  \ Refuse, and the shadows may grow longer than you expect.
proposition22.text=%s, you are walking in the footsteps of the SLDF, tracing paths they once tread in\
  \ secrecy. We seek the same location as you, and offer C-bills to lighten your burden. Know that\
  \ roads not taken often have watchers.
proposition23.text=%s, the Star League depot's secrets are old, but our interest in them is new. The\
  \ coordinates, exchanged for C-bills, could secure your future - if you choose to share them. Just\
  \ remember, history is often written by those who find it first.
proposition24.text=%s, we sense you are close to the Star League depot, an echo of the SLDF's lost\
  \ legacy. We offer C-bills for its location, and our offer stands for a short time. Remember, eyes\
  \ are always watching those who seek the past.
proposition25.text=%s, the location you seek has seen more than battles; it has seen betrayal and\
  \ ambition. The Star League depot's coordinates are valuable to us. C-bills are offered in exchange.\
  \ Be cautious - persistence can attract the gaze of those who move in silence.
proposition26.text=%s, what you chase is both tangible and elusive. We seek only the coordinates of\
  \ the Star League depot, and we offer C-bills in return. Time is a fickle ally; those who linger\
  \ too long may find themselves pursued.
proposition27.text=%s, the SLDF left many things behind - this depot is just one of them. We are willing\
  \ to compensate you in C-bills for its location. But be aware: old ghosts often find new hunters.\
  \ Delay may not be wise.
proposition28.text=%s, some legacies were never meant to be uncovered, yet here you are. The Star League\
  \ depot holds value, and so do C-bills. We offer them in exchange for the coordinates, but whispers\
  \ travel fast. Silence has a cost.
proposition29.text=%s, you approach a place where the SLDF's intentions are frozen in time. We wish to\
  \ acquire the coordinates, offering C-bills for what you find. But tread lightly - there are those\
  \ who would prefer that such locations remain forgotten.
proposition30.text=%s, the Star League depot is a key - one that unlocks both opportunity and danger.\
  \ We seek its location, offering C-bills for your cooperation. But keys can turn both ways; keep\
  \ that in mind as you consider our offer.
proposition31.text=%s, knowledge of the SLDF's remnants carries weight, as does the Star League depot's\
  \ location. We offer C-bills in exchange, but understand this: you are not the only seeker. The\
  \ quietest hunters are often the deadliest.
proposition32.text=%s, the past calls to those who listen, and it seems you have answered. The Star\
  \ League depot holds truths that should be uncovered, for the right price. We offer C-bills, but\
  \ others may offer something far less forgiving.
proposition33.text=%s, the SLDF once guarded secrets with zeal, and this Star League depot is no\
  \ exception. We seek its coordinates and will provide C-bills in return. Be wary - secrets long\
  \ buried can attract dangerous interest.
proposition34.text=%s, you walk a path few dare to tread. The Star League depot is closer than you\
  \ think. We offer C-bills for its location, but haste is advised. The past has many eyes, and not\
  \ all are friendly.
proposition35.text=%s, the SLDF's legacy is fraught with hidden agendas. The Star League depot is part\
  \ of that tale. We offer C-bills for its coordinates, but know that even shadows have their own\
  \ purposes.
proposition36.text=%s, some say the Star League depot is cursed, others that it is guarded. We are\
  \ interested only in its location, offering C-bills in exchange. But consider this: doors opened\
  \ too soon can let in more than just opportunity.
proposition37.text=%s, you seek what the SLDF could not protect forever. The Star League depot's\
  \ coordinates are what we desire, and C-bills are what we offer. However, hesitation can be\
  \ dangerous when others are also searching.
proposition38.text=%s, the Star League depot you pursue is part of a larger web, one spun long ago.\
  \ We wish to know its location, and C-bills are our currency of exchange. Be warned, however -\
  \ some webs have more than one spider.
proposition39.text=%s, the depot's coordinates are more than just a location; they are a piece of the\
  \ SLDF's forgotten war. We offer C-bills in return, but the clock is ticking. Know that the past\
  \ is a powerful force, and it does not always forgive.
proposition40.text=%s, the Star League depot you seek is a dangerous prize. We demand the coordinates\
  \ in exchange for C-bills. Refuse, and others - far less diplomatic - will come calling. You don't\
  \ want to be in their crosshairs.
proposition41.text=%s, time is not your ally. The SLDF left behind many secrets, and this Star League\
  \ depot is one of the most coveted. Provide the coordinates, accept the C-bills, and avoid\
  \ complications. Refuse, and those complications will find you.
proposition42.text=%s, your pursuit of the Star League depot is attracting attention beyond your control.\
  \ We offer C-bills in exchange for the coordinates, but consider this your final chance. The next\
  \ contact may not be as patient - or as generous.
proposition43.text=%s, we know you're close to the Star League depot. Deliver the coordinates, or face\
  \ the consequences of keeping such knowledge hidden. Our offer of C-bills is the only peaceful\
  \ resolution you'll receive.
proposition44.text=%s, history's secrets are not meant for everyone. The Star League depot is no exception.\
  \ We offer C-bills for its location, but decline at your own peril. Others will be less interested\
  \ in negotiation and more interested in results.
proposition45.text=%s, you may believe you have time, but that is a dangerous illusion. The Star League\
  \ depot's coordinates are needed now. Accept the C-bills offered, or expect a less pleasant approach\
  \ from others already en route.
proposition46.text=%s, this is not merely an offer - it's a warning. The Star League depot has many eyes\
  \ upon it, some less forgiving than others. Provide the coordinates, take the C-bills, and leave\
  \ the shadows behind. Refusal will only invite them closer.
proposition47.text=%s, the SLDF's secrets come with a heavy cost. You stand at a crossroads: accept our\
  \ C-bills for the Star League depot's location, or face the inevitable interest of those who won't\
  \ ask twice.
proposition48.text=%s, we both know the value of the Star League depot. We also know the danger of delay.\
  \ We offer C-bills for its coordinates. Decline, and the next visitor may not be inclined to negotiate.
proposition49.text=%s, we understand the risks you've taken in finding the Star League depot. But risks\
  \ have a way of multiplying when they're ignored. Provide the coordinates and accept our C-bills,\
  \ or suffer the consequences of silence.
proposition50.text=%s, the Star League depot's location is no longer a secret. Others are closing in,\
  \ and their intentions are not as peaceful as ours. This is your final opportunity to exchange it\
  \ for C-bills. Refuse, and you may find yourself hunted.
proposition51.text=%s, you are walking a dangerous path. The SLDF left behind many ghosts, and the Star\
  \ League depot is one of them. Give us the coordinates and take the C-bills, or find yourself\
  \ haunted by more than just history.
proposition52.text=%s, the past can be a cruel teacher. The Star League depot's location is of great\
  \ interest to many, not all of whom care for your well-being. Deliver the coordinates and secure\
  \ your C-bills. The alternative is far less forgiving.
proposition53.text=%s, we are not alone in our pursuit of the Star League depot. Provide the coordinates,\
  \ accept the C-bills, and avoid the chaos that follows. Delay will only attract the wolves.
proposition54.text=%s, you must understand: the Star League depot is a beacon, and you are standing too\
  \ close. Offer the coordinates in exchange for C-bills, or expect the arrival of those who prefer to\
  \ take what they want by force.
proposition55.text=%s, knowledge of the SLDF depot's location is a dangerous thing. We offer C-bills for\
  \ the coordinates, but time is running out. Those who do not act quickly often become collateral.
proposition56.text=%s, we will not wait forever. The Star League depot is too valuable, and your hesitation\
  \ is drawing dangerous attention. Provide the coordinates, take the C-bills, and avoid the fate of\
  \ those who are too slow to act.
proposition57.text=%s, the Star League depot has become a target, and so have you. Deliver the coordinates\
  \ now, receive your C-bills, and walk away. Refuse, and you may find your options rapidly disappearing.
proposition58.text=%s, this is the last offer you'll receive from us regarding the Star League depot.\
  \ Accept the C-bills for its coordinates, or face those who have less patience for negotiation. You\
  \ do not want to test their resolve.
proposition59.text=%s, the SLDF depot is a prize worth fighting for - and dying for. We offer C-bills\
  \ for its location, but be warned: others are not far behind, and they are far less concerned with\
  \ your survival.
proposition60.text=%s, I hear you're getting close to that Star League depot. I've got some serious C-bills\
  \ waiting for you if you're willing to share the location. Let's keep this simple and beneficial for\
  \ both of us. After all, who needs unnecessary complications, right?
proposition61.text=%s, you've done some impressive work tracking that Star League depot! I've got a good\
  \ feeling about this. How about we make a deal? A generous sum of C-bills in exchange for the coordinates\
  \ - no strings attached. Let's make this a win-win, shall we?
proposition62.text=%s, I've always admired your tenacity. Finding a Star League depot is no small feat!\
  \ I'm willing to pay a fair amount of C-bills for the location. No need to make things difficult -\
  \ just a straightforward deal between two professionals.
proposition63.text=%s, it's not every day someone stumbles across a Star League depot. Lucky for you,\
  \ I happen to be in the market for that exact kind of information. I'll make it worth your while -\
  \ C-bills, quick and easy. What do you say?
proposition64.text=%s, I'll be honest - this Star League depot is the stuff of legend. I'm sure you're\
  \ ready for a good payday, so how about we swap the coordinates for a nice pile of C-bills? No fuss,\
  \ no hassle - just a friendly exchange.
proposition65.text=%s, you're on the verge of a big find! I'm talking about that Star League depot, of\
  \ course. I've got a hefty sum of C-bills ready to go, just for the coordinates. Think of it as a\
  \ friendly favor that pays off handsomely.
proposition66.text=%s, it's not every day someone uncovers a piece of SLDF history like this depot. I'd\
  \ love to be a part of your success story. Let's swap the coordinates for a good amount of C-bills,\
  \ and you'll walk away with a heavy wallet.
proposition67.text=%s, I've been following your progress with this Star League depot, and I've got to\
  \ say, I like your style! How about a friendly deal - coordinates for C-bills? It's a simple trade\
  \ that'll put a smile on your face.
proposition68.text=%s, you've done the hard work of finding the Star League depot, and now I'd like to\
  \ help you cash in on it. I've got C-bills with your name on them, ready to be transferred as soon\
  \ as we get the coordinates. Easy money!
proposition69.text=%s, you and I both know how rare it is to find something tied to the SLDF. I've got\
  \ the C-bills to make this worth your while. Let's keep things simple - coordinates for cash. No\
  \ need to make this more complicated than it has to be!
proposition70.text=%s, you've got a nose for finding lost treasures, and that Star League depot is a\
  \ prime example. I'm offering a nice pile of C-bills for the location. Let's make this a friendly,\
  \ profitable exchange. After all, who doesn't like a good payday?
proposition71.text=%s, you're on a hot streak with this Star League depot, and I want to be a part of\
  \ it. I'm offering a generous sum of C-bills for the coordinates - easy money for you, and no strings\
  \ attached. Let's shake hands, so to speak.
proposition72.text=%s, finding a Star League depot is no small feat, but getting paid for it? That's the\
  \ fun part. I've got the C-bills ready for you. All I need is the location, and we both walk away\
  \ happy. What do you say?
proposition73.text=%s, you've got yourself a golden opportunity with that Star League depot. I've got\
  \ C-bills burning a hole in my pocket, and I'd love to share them with you in exchange for the\
  \ coordinates. Let's make this a smooth, friendly deal.
proposition74.text=%s, let's make this a story we can both smile about. You give me the Star League\
  \ depot's coordinates, and I'll make sure you're paid handsomely in C-bills. No drama, no\
  \ complications - just a friendly exchange.
proposition75.text=%s, I'm sure you're used to these kinds of negotiations, so let me be clear: you\
  \ provide the Star League depot's location, and you'll have more C-bills than you know what to do\
  \ with. No hard feelings, just business.
proposition76.text=%s, you've got yourself a fine opportunity with that SLDF depot. But let's be honest\
  \ - turning coordinates into C-bills is even better. I'm offering just that, with no strings\
  \ attached. Friends keep things simple, after all.
proposition77.text=%s, I'm not here to complicate things. I just want the Star League depot's coordinates,\
  \ and I'm more than happy to pay you well for them in C-bills. Let's keep this simple, friend - no\
  \ need to let others get involved
proposition78.text=%s, let's not beat around the bush. The Star League depot you've found is impressive,\
  \ but I'm sure you'd prefer the C-bills I'm offering. A fair trade, wouldn't you say? We can keep\
  \ this all friendly and profitable.
proposition79.text=%s, we both know that finding a Star League depot is no small feat. But selling the\
  \ info? Now that's easy. Let me take it off your hands for a good price in C-bills. We both get\
  \ what we want, and no one gets hurt.
proposition80.text=%s, you're a real pro at this, I can tell. So let's keep it professional, but friendly:\
  \ you hand over the Star League depot's location, and I'll hand over the C-bills. No drama, just a\
  \ clean deal.
proposition81.text=%s, I've heard you're closing in on an SLDF treasure. How about we make a deal? You\
  \ share the coordinates, and I'll make sure you're enjoying a nice payday with a generous amount of\
  \ C-bills. Just good business, friend.
proposition82.text=%s, I know how these things go - sometimes you're the one who finds the Star League\
  \ depot, and sometimes you're the one who buys the info. This time, I'm buying. Let's make a friendly\
  \ exchange for C-bills, shall we?
proposition83.text=%s, you're onto something good with that Star League depot. I can help make it even\
  \ better - with a pile of C-bills, of course. Just share the coordinates, and we'll both walk away\
  \ smiling.
proposition84.text=%s, I admire your tenacity in tracking down that SLDF depot. But you know what's better\

  \ can count. What do you say?
proposition85.text=%s, let's cut to the chase. I want the Star League depot's coordinates, and you want\
  \ C-bills. I'm here to make sure you get exactly what you deserve, with a little extra for your\
  \ troubles. No need to complicate things.
proposition86.text=%s, you've always struck me as someone who knows a good deal when they see one. Here\
  \ it is: you give me the Star League depot's location, and I'll fill your coffers with C-bills.\
  \ Let's make it easy on both of us.
proposition87.text=%s, you've got yourself a real find with that Star League depot. I'd love to take it\
  \ off your hands - just the coordinates, of course. I'll make sure you're rolling in C-bills before\
  \ you know it. Friends help friends, right?
proposition88.text=%s, chasing down a Star League depot isn't easy work. I respect that. But why do it\
  \ the hard way? You share the location, and I'll make sure you're flush with C-bills. We can both\
  \ walk away happy, no strings attached.
proposition89.text=%s, I've got a feeling we're both after the same thing - the Star League depot. But\
  \ hey, I'm offering C-bills for the coordinates, fair and square. Why not cash in now and save\
  \ yourself the trouble of unwanted company?
proposition90.text=%s, it's not every day you get this close to an SLDF depot, is it? I can make it\
  \ worth your while. Just a friendly deal between us: you give me the coordinates, and I give you\
  \ a nice stack of C-bills. No fuss, no muss.
proposition91.text=%s, I hear you're hot on the trail of a Star League depot. Let's not make things\

  \ the day's out. Just between friends, yeah?
