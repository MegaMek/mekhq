NEW_VERSION_WITH_OLD_DATA.message={0}, fantastic news: we''ve just had an update to our command and control software,\
  \ with loads of new features!\
  <p>By the way, I thought I should tell you that the system is gonna be compiling for about 15-20 minutes so some of\
  \ the minor systems might go on and off, but it''s nothing to worry about.</p>\
  <p>In the meanwhile, I''ve included a few notes on how to restore full operational control.</p>
NEW_VERSION_WITH_OLD_DATA.ooc=<b>Getting Started with the New Version</b>\
  <p>Once your campaign has finished loading (it won''t take any longer than usual), open <b>Campaign Options</b>. We\
  \ highly recommend checking to see if any options have changed. New options are marked with a special symbol, which\
  \ you can find on the General tab.</p>\
  <p>Even if you don''t make any changes, make sure to click <b>Confirm</b>. This updates the campaign options stored in\
  \ your save file to the latest version.</p>\
  <p>If you have any <b>Custom Campaign Option Presets</b>, be sure to load and update each one. Using outdated presets\
  \ can cause unexpected issues.</p>\
  <p>After updating your campaign options, click <b>Advance Day</b> <i>once</i> before exiting the client. And don''t\
  \ forget to save!</p>\
  <p>That''s it! Enjoy the new version, and if you encounter any bugs, let us know. Your feedback helps us keep making\
  \ MekHQ the best Mek Management tool in the Inner Sphere. Good hunting! \u2014The MegaMek Team</p>
