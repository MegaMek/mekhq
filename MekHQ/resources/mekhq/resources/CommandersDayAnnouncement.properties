commandersDay.message.0.ic={0}, just wanted to give you a heads-up - the kids have put together something special called\
  \ "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve made drawings, crafts, and even a few creative skits to celebrate you as their favorite leader. It''s honestly\
  \ pretty adorable, and they''ve been buzzing with excitement about surprising you.</p>\
  <p>They''ve set up the common area, and they''re really hoping you can drop by to see their hard work. I think you''re\
  \ about to see a whole new side of your fan club!</p>
commandersDay.message.1.ic={0}, I just wanted to give you a quick heads-up - the unit''s children have organized something\
  \ they''re calling "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve been working on it in secret for a while, putting together drawings, crafts, and a few little performances\
  \ dedicated to you.</p>\
  <p>It''s their way of saying thank you and showing how much they appreciate having you as their leader. They''re pretty\
  \ excited about it, and I think it would mean a lot to them if you could stop by. The common area is all set up, and\
  \ they''re ready to show you what they''ve put together.</p>\
  <p>Let me know if you''d like any help making time for it.</p>
commandersDay.message.2.ic={0}, I wanted to let you know that the unit''s children have organized something they''re\
  \ calling "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>It''s their way of honoring you and showing how much they admire your leadership. They''ve put together some artwork,\
  \ crafts, and homemade cookies made in your likeness.</p>\
  <p>It''s been inspiring to see how much effort they''ve put into making this day special for you. They clearly look up\
  \ to you, and I know they''re hoping you can be part of it. The common area has been set up for the event, and it would\
  \ mean a lot to them if you could stop by.</p>
commandersDay.message.3.ic={0}, the kids have put together a little something they''re calling "{0} {1} Day" to show how\
  \ much they appreciate having you around.\
  <p>They''ve been working on drawings, crafts, and even a poster. It''s really heartwarming to see how much effort they''ve\
  \ put in.</p>\
  <p>They''re really hoping you can take a moment to stop by. Seeing you there would make their day, and I think you''ll\
  \ be pleasantly surprised by what they''ve come up with.</p>
commandersDay.message.4.ic={0}, heads up, {0}! The kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day" and put together a little celebration\
  \ just for you.\
  <p>They''ve made drawings, crafts, and even a few skits. They''ve been talking about it non-stop, and it''s clear they\
  \ really want you to know how much they appreciate you.</p>\
  <p>The common area''s all set up, and they''re ready to show off their creations. I think you''ll find it pretty\
  \ entertaining - plus, it''s not every day you get your own holiday!</p>
commandersDay.message.5.ic={0}, I wanted to let you know that the unit''s children have organized "{0} {1} Day" as a way\
  \ to celebrate you.\
  <p>They''ve put together some creative projects - drawings, crafts, and a few presentations - all meant to show their\
  \ appreciation.</p>\
  <p>It seems they see you as a role model and wanted to find a way to express that.</p>\
  <p>I know it would really mean a lot to them if you could make it. The common area is set up, and the parents are eagerly\
  \ waiting to see your reaction.</p>
commandersDay.message.6.ic={0}, just wanted to give you a little heads-up, {0} - the unit''s kids have put together something\
  \ special called "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>Apparently, they''ve been working on it for a while - drawings, crafts, and a few little performances. It''s their\
  \ way of saying thanks and showing you how much they look up to you.</p>\
  <p>They''ve set up the common area for a bit of a presentation, and it would really make their day if you could stop\
  \ by.</p>
commandersDay.message.7.ic={0}, just thought I''d give you a heads-up - you''ve officially got your own holiday now!\
  <p>The kids have declared it "{0} {1} Day" and have been putting together crafts, drawings, and a few skits to\
  \ celebrate. They''re beyond excited to surprise you.</p>\
  <p>The common area is all set up, and they''re hoping to see you there. I think they might even have a few "{0} {1}"\
  \ replicas made out of cardboard - it''s honestly pretty impressive.</p>
commandersDay.message.8.ic={0}, the unit''s children have put together something they''re calling "{0} {1} Day" as a way to\
  \ show their appreciation for you.\
  <p>They''ve created some artwork, crafts, and even a play titled "{0} {1} vs. The Tetatae." Don''t ask me what a\
  \ ''Tetatae'', I''ve no clue either, but apparently you''re fighting them.</p>\
  <p>I will say it''s touching to see how much they value having you as a leader and role model.</p>\
  <p>They''re hoping you can spare a few moments to see what they''ve prepared.</p>
commandersDay.message.9.ic={0}, just wanted to let you know that the unit''s children have organized something they''re\
  \ calling "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve been working on it for a while now - creating drawings, crafting little mementos, and setting up snacks in\
  \ the common area. Congratulations, you''re a cake now!</p>\
  <p>Anyway, it''s their way of showing how much they appreciate you and how important you are to them. They''re pretty\
  \ excited and really hoping you''ll be able to make it.</p>
commandersDay.message.10.ic={0}, heads up - you''ve officially made it to celebrity status!\
  <p>The kids have declared it "{0} {1} Day" and have gone all out. There''s artwork, homemade decorations, and what\
  \ appears to be a papier-mache version of your head. I''m not saying it''s life-sized, but it''s unsettlingly accurate.</p>\
  <p>Regardless, they''re really excited to surprise you, so maybe prepare your best "I''m totally not overwhelmed"\
  \ smile.</p>\
  <p> Let me know if you''d like backup!</p>
commandersDay.message.11.ic={0}, I hope you''re ready to handle your newfound fame, because it''s "{0} {1} Day"!\
  <p>The kids have been plotting - I mean, <i>planning</i> - for days. There are crafts, questionable sculptures, and\
  \ what I can only describe as a dramatic interpretive dance celebrating your leadership.</p>\
  <p>Try not to look too shocked when you see the drawings. Some of them are... artistic interpretations of your nose.</p>
commandersDay.message.12.ic=Just thought you''d like to know - you''re now an official icon, {0}.\
  <p>The kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day" and turned you into a legend. There are drawings, crafts, and even a\
  \ puppet that - if you squint - looks vaguely like you.</p>\
  <p>I strongly advise preparing a speech, because apparently, great leaders deserve great awkwardness.</p>\
  <p>Good luck!</p>
commandersDay.message.13.ic=Congratulations, you''ve made it! The kids have created "{0} {1} Day" to honor their favorite\
  \ leader.\
  <p>There are drawings, some remarkably creative sculptures, and one particularly ambitious banner that calls you\
  \ "The Ultimate {0}" (spelled wrong).</p>\
  <p>Just be prepared for some enthusiastic high-fives and at least one child dressed as "Mini-{1}."</p>\
  <p>You''ve been warned.</p>
commandersDay.message.14.ic={0}, I regret to inform you that you are now officially a holiday.\
  <p>The kids have established "{0} {1} Day" and gone full throttle on celebrating you. There''s a shrine (well, a table),\
  \ drawings depicting your epic victories (real or imagined), and one child insisting you have superpowers.</p>\
  <p>Prepare to be worshipped - responsibly, of course.</p>
commandersDay.message.15.ic=Just thought I''d let you know, {0}, you''ve been immortalized.\
  <p>The kids have organized "{0} {1} Day" and have been crafting tributes like it''s their life mission. There''s one\
  \ sculpture that vaguely resembles a heroic potato with your face on it. I''m pretty sure they meant well.</p>\
  <p>You might want to practice your "I''m not laughing" face.</p>
commandersDay.message.16.ic=Looks like you''ve made it to the big leagues, {0}, the kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>There''s a parade (well, two kids marching), some interpretive artwork, and one disturbingly detailed portrait where\
  \ your chin takes up half your face.</p>\
  <p>It''s all done with a lot of heart and just enough chaos. You might want to look surprised - apparently, they''re\
  \ expecting a big reaction.</p>
commandersDay.message.17.ic={0}, it is my duty to inform you that the kids have initiated "{0} {1} Day" and are\
  \ currently in the process of transforming you into a legendary figure.\
  <p>There''s even a mural that seems to suggest you once single-handedly defeated a space monster. Artistic liberties were\
  \ taken.</p>\
  <p>Prepare to be adored - awkwardly and with lots of glitter.</p>
commandersDay.message.18.ic=Just thought I''d let you know, {0}, you''ve become an icon.\
  <p>The kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day!"</p>\
  <p>There''s a whole display of art dedicated to your "heroic achievements," which includes what I assume is a drawing\
  \ of you wrestling a space dragon.</p>\
  <p>Your fan base appears to have grown exponentially since last year, mostly among the under-12 demographic. Prepare\
  \ to sign autographs.</p>
commandersDay.message.19.ic=Just giving you a heads-up, {0}, the kids have taken it upon themselves to declare "{0} {1}\
  \ Day."\
  <p>They''ve created a fan club (unofficial, but highly enthusiastic) and have prepared a series of "tributes" to your\
  \ greatness. One of the kids insisted on recreating your uniform out of paper - it''s almost accurate, except for the\
  \ neon crayon.</p>\
  <p>They''re expecting a visit from their favorite {0}, so I''d recommend preparing your "I''m not sure what''s happening"\
  \ face.</p>\
  <p>You''ve officially gone from leader to legend.</p>
commandersDay.message.20.ic=So... this is a bit weird, {0}, but the kids have officially declared today "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve made some, uh, very detailed drawings of you. One of them features you with what I can only assume are\
  \ superhero muscles, holding a flag that just says, "BEST EVE\u042F."</p>\
  <p>They''re really hoping you''ll show up and, well... appreciate their enthusiasm. Right now, I think they might be\
  \ chanting something that sounds like "{1}, {1}, {1}" down the hall.</p>
commandersDay.message.21.ic=So, the kids have taken it upon themselves to make today "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>It''s mostly adorable... except for the large papier-mache head they made that''s currently sitting in the common\
  \ area. It''s a little... unsettling. They''re really proud of it, though.</p>\
  <p>One of the older kids tried to put it on and declared himself "{0} {1} Jr." I thought you''d want to know.</p>\
  <p>If you can drop by, maybe we can address the... situation together.</p>
commandersDay.message.22.ic={0}, the kids have taken creativity to a new level - they''ve turned today into "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>There''s a puppet show. Featuring you. The puppets are made of socks, and one of them vaguely resembles you if you\
  \ ignore the googly eyes and glitter.</p>\
  <p>They''re really excited and have been practicing... whatever that is. I figured a little warning might help you\
  \ prepare.</p>\
  <p>Best of luck.</p>
commandersDay.message.23.ic={0}, this is to warn you that the unit''s children have declared today "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>The event includes an assortment of interpretive art pieces, some of which depict you in various heroic poses - one\
  \ of which involves you riding a space whale.</p>\
  <p>The children are expecting a formal appearance from you and may request an autograph. Please advise on how you wish\
  \ to proceed with this... unique situation.</p>
commandersDay.message.24.ic=So, um... the kids declared it "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve set up a whole thing in the common area, and it''s... something. There''s a poster that says, "We Love You"\
  \ but it''s crossed out because they got nervous halfway through.</p>\
  <p>There''s also some singing. I''m not entirely sure what the song is, but your name is in it at least 47 times. Just\
  \ thought you should be aware before you walk in.</p>\
  <p>Good luck.</p>
commandersDay.message.25.ic=I''m not quite sure how to put this, {0}, but the kids have gone all in on "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>There''s a life-sized cutout of you made entirely out of ration boxes. It''s impressively detailed... except for the\
  \ part where your eyes look in opposite directions.</p>\
  <p>They''re calling it "{0}," and saluting it. I''m pretty sure they want to present it to you as a "symbol of\
  \ leadership." I have no idea what that means.</p>\
  <p>Prepare yourself.</p>
commandersDay.message.26.ic=So... the kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day" and it''s kind of spiraled out of control.\
  <p>There''s an elaborate skit where one of the kids impersonates you giving orders, complete with a makeshift uniform\
  \ that looks suspiciously like a tablecloth.</p>\
  <p>They''re rehearsing very seriously. I''m not entirely sure how to break it to them that it''s... a bit much. I thought\
  \ you''d want a heads-up before you see your "mini-me" in action.</p>
commandersDay.message.27.ic=Just letting you know... the kids have decided it''s "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>There''s a mural. It''s supposed to be you leading a charge, but it mostly looks like a bunch of triangles holding\
  \ sticks. One of them has your name written in huge letters just in case no one recognized it.</p>\
  <p>Also, there''s cake. I''m not sure what flavor it is, but the icing spells out "{1} RuleS" in what I hope is\
  \ chocolate.</p>\
  <p>Repeat after me: "this is fine."</p>
commandersDay.message.28.ic=The kids have officially declared it "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve made a collage of your "greatest moments," but some of the photos are definitely not you. One of them might\
  \ actually be a random Astech worker holding a sandwich.</p>\
  <p>They also made a song, and I think the chorus just repeats "{0} {1} is cool" about 20 times. They''re practicing very\
  \ enthusiastically.</p>\
  <p>Brace yourself.</p>
commandersDay.message.29.ic={0}, I just have to let you know - you''re about to walk into the most unexpectedly adorable\
  \ disaster I''ve ever seen.\
  <p>The kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day" and let''s just say... their artistic interpretations of you are unique.</p>\
  <p>One drawing has your head twice the size of your body, and I think they accidentally made you cross-eyed.</p>\
  <p>They''re really proud of it though, and I honestly can''t stop laughing every time I walk by. You''re going to want to\
  \ see this.</p>
commandersDay.message.30.ic=Okay, I have to share this - the kids have made today "{0} {1} Day," and it is absolutely\
  \ priceless.\
  <p>There''s a life-sized cardboard cutout of you in the common area, but the proportions are so off that you look like\
  \ a very heroic giraffe.</p>\
  <p>They''re so proud of it, and I can''t help but admire their enthusiasm. You''ve got to come see this - it''s too good\
  \ to miss.</p>
commandersDay.message.31.ic={0}, I just walked through the common area, and I can''t stop laughing.\
  <p>The kids have officially made today "{0} {1} Day" and created what I can only describe as the most epic tribute\
  \ I''ve ever seen.</p>\
  <p>There''s a papier-mache bust of you that looks like it''s either smiling or terrified - I can''t tell.</p>\
  <p>One kid is narrating your "adventures" with a level of enthusiasm I''ve never seen before. The team cannot stop\
  \ laughing.</p>
commandersDay.message.32.ic=I can''t lie, {0}, I''m having a hard time keeping a straight face.\
  <p>The kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day," and they''ve made a giant banner that says, "{1} Saves the Day!" Except,\
  \ they spelled "{0}" as "{0}o," so it currently reads "{0}o {1} Saves the Day!"</p>\
  <p>They''re so proud of it, and I honestly don''t have the heart to correct them.</p>
commandersDay.message.33.ic={0}, you need to see this.\
  <p>The kids have decided it''s "{0} {1} Day" and, well... they made a model of you out of shell casings and spare parts.\
  \ I''m not entirely sure if it''s a robot or a sculpture, but it''s definitely trying to wave.</p>\
  <p>One of the kids declared, "It''s as tough as {0} {1}!" I''m still trying to figure out how to explain that the head\
  \ being upside down was probably not intentional.</p>
commandersDay.message.34.ic=You''re not going to believe this, {0}.\
  <p>The kids have put together a tribute for "{0} {1} Day," and it''s an absolute riot. There''s a song that goes,\
  \ "{1} is strong, {1} is brave, {1} can fix anything - except a sandwich." They were so earnest about it that I\
  \ couldn''t even correct the rhyme.</p>\
  <p>Don''t worry if you miss it, one of the techs rigged up a spare BattleROM recorder.</p>
commandersDay.message.35.ic=I don''t know whether to laugh or applaud. The kids have made today "{0} {1} Day," and there''s\
  \ a parade of sorts.\
  <p>It involves one of them riding on each other''s backs while waving a flag that just says, "{1} Rules!"</p>\
  <p>They''re making victory noises and shouting your name. It''s honestly the most chaotic tribute I''ve ever seen, and\
  \ I''m living for it.</p>\
  <p>You''ve got to come witness this masterpiece.</p>
commandersDay.message.36.ic=You have to see this, {0}. The kids declared today "{0} {1} Day," and they''ve made a collage\
  \ of "heroic poses" they think you''ve done.\
  <p>One has you lifting an engine block with one hand while piloting a ''Mek with the other. I''m pretty sure they''ve\
  \ confused you with a superhero.</p>\
  <p>It''s adorable, it''s weird, and it''s absolutely hilarious. Don''t miss it.</p>
commandersDay.message.37.ic={0}, I just walked past the common area, and I can''t breathe from laughing.\
  <p>The kids have made a "tribute song" for "{0} {1} Day" that involves clapping, stomping, and shouting, "{1} the\
  \ Brave, {1} the Bold, {1}''s the best at bringing the gold!"</p>\
  <p>The enthusiasm is unmatched. I''m pretty sure they think you''re secretly a space cowboy.</p>
commandersDay.message.38.ic=Okay, {0}, I can''t even pretend to be serious here.\
  <p>The kids have turned today into "{0} {1} Day," and they''ve made a mural of you. It''s... unique. Your arms are way\
  \ too long, and there''s a caption that says, "{0} {1}: Best Boss."</p>\
  <p>One of the kids insists it''s because you''re "always working to save the day." I can''t stop grinning. You''re\
  \ definitely going to want to see it before they add more glitter.</p>
commandersDay.message.39.ic=Apparently, today is "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>The kids took it upon themselves to organize it. They''ve set up some kind of... tribute area in the common room.\
  \ I''ve already been dragged over twice to "admire" a papier-mache version of you.</p>\
  <p>Honestly, I''ve got a lot on my plate, but they''re insisting that you show up. If you could just put in an appearance,\
  \ maybe they''ll stop flagging me down every five minutes.</p>
commandersDay.message.40.ic=Apparently, it''s "{0} {1} Day" now.\
  <p>The kids have taken over the common area with drawings, posters, and some kind of chant involving your name. I''ve\
  \ had to pause my actual work to go see their "creative interpretation" of your heroic deeds.</p>\
  <p>Since they won''t quit asking about you, could you just swing by for five minutes? Maybe then they''ll let me get\
  \ back to my job.</p>
commandersDay.message.41.ic=Just a quick note because, apparently, this needs to be on my radar - today is "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>The kids have set up a weird sort of shrine made out of ration crates and duct tape. I''ve already had three of them\
  \ drag me over to look at it.</p>\
  <p>If you could just show up and say something nice, maybe they''ll stop pestering everyone who walks by.</p>
commandersDay.message.42.ic=Apparently, I''m now part of the planning committee for "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>The kids are practically holding me hostage until I promise to tell you about their "celebration." There''s a puppet\
  \ show involved. I don''t even know where they found puppets.</p>\
  <p>I''m just passing this on because it''s faster than arguing with them. Please just make an appearance, so I can get\
  \ back to my actual duties.</p>
commandersDay.message.43.ic=So, guess what, {0}? That''s right: the kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day."</p>\
  <p>There''s an entire wall of drawings, most of which look like stick figures in uniform. One of them might be you, or\
  \ it might be a tree - I honestly can''t tell.</p>\
  <p>They''re asking for you specifically, and it would save me a lot of time if you just showed up, nodded, and\
  \ pretended to be impressed.</p>
commandersDay.message.44.ic=In case no one''s told you yet, the kids have decided it''s "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>I''ve been interrupted at least four times because they want "official approval" from someone in charge. They made a\
  \ banner that''s currently half falling off the wall because they used tape that isn''t strong enough.</p>\
  <p>It would really help if you could just go see it so they stop calling me over every two minutes.</p>
commandersDay.message.45.ic=Look, the kids made today "{0} {1} Day," and they''re not going to stop until you see what\
  \ they''ve done.\
  <p>There''s glitter everywhere, and I''m pretty sure some of it''s stuck to the command console.</p>\
  <p>Can you just go see it so they stop bugging me about it? I''ve got actual work piling up here.</p>
commandersDay.message.46.ic=Apparently, you''ve become a holiday.\
  <p>The kids have made today "{0} {1} Day." They''ve set up a "ceremonial chair" for you, and they''re asking me if they\
  \ should prepare a speech. I''m not sure where they got this idea, but it''s spiraling out of control.</p>\
  <p>It would save me a lot of hassle if you just went over there and acknowledged whatever it is they''re doing. I''d\
  \ rather not have to negotiate seating arrangements with a bunch of kids.</p>
commandersDay.message.47.ic=So, I''m stuck dealing with the aftermath of the kids deciding today is "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>They''ve written some kind of chant and are marching in a circle, shouting your name. I tried to redirect them to\
  \ something quieter, but they just got louder.</p>\
  <p>If you could just show up for five minutes, maybe they''ll calm down and I can go back to my workload. Please.</p>
commandersDay.message.48.ic=Apparently, the kids have turned today into "{0} {1} Day."\
  <p>There''s a table set up with what they''re calling your "greatest achievements," which mostly consist of drawings\
  \ where you look like a robot knight. I''ve been asked to supervise, but frankly, I''ve got more pressing things to\
  \ do.</p>\
  <p>Can you just swing by and give them a thumbs up or something? They''re not going to stop pestering me until you\
  \ do.</p>
commandersDay.message.49.ic=You''re not going to believe this one, {0}.\
  <p>The kids have declared today "{0} {1} Day," and somehow, it''s evolved into a... pie-throwing contest? Yeah, I don''t\
  \ know either.</p>\
  <p>Apparently, someone started a rumor that you "love pie" and that pie-throwing is a traditional way to honor you.</p>\
  <p>Now there''s a lineup of kids holding homemade pies, chanting your name, and throwing the aforementioned pies at\
  \ anyone who walks past. The mess hall is, well, a mess.</p>\
  <p>I tried to intervene and now I''m covered in pie.</p>\
  <p>At this point, I''m just trying to minimize the damage. If you can drop by and diplomatically redirect this energy,\
  \ it would be greatly appreciated. Also, maybe don''t wear your best uniform.</p>
