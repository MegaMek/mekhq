lblFurtherReading.text=<html><h2 style="text-align:center;">BATTLEMECH MANUAL (BMM)</h2>\
  The BattleMech Manual, built from the ground up with the latest rules, is specifically designed for BattleTech players\
  \ seeking an all-'Mek combat experience. It serves as the ideal starting point for new players learning the battle rules.\
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">TOTAL WARFARE (TW)</h2>\
  Total Warfare is the definitive rulebook for experienced BattleTech players, serving as a comprehensive reference\
  \ guide rather than an introductory teaching tool. For construction rules related to the various units featured in\
  \ Total Warfare, refer to the TechManual.\
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">CAMPAIGN OPERATIONS (CamOps)</h2>\
  Campaign Operations offers rules for creating and managing forces, whether it is a struggling mercenary battalion or\
  \ a well-equipped House regiment. The book's final sections introduce diverse options for campaign play, enabling\
  \ players to run thrilling campaigns of virtually any type with their newly created forces. Campaign Operations\
  \ serves as the foundational rulebook for modern MekHQ.\
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">A TIME OF WAR (ATOW)</h2>\
  BattleTech: A Time of War is one of two official role-playing games set in the universe of Battletech. It lets players\
  \ step into any role - from elite MechWarrior to cunning spy - using a detailed, point-based system. Starting in 2024,\
  \ we adopted ATOW as primary reference point for character progression in MekHQ. In 2025 we started incorporating more\
  \ of ATOW's systems to ensure MekHQ can supplement campaign play with a more in-depth roleplay experience.</html>

  \ this off.

stratConPromo.message=<html><body style='width: 500px'><br><div style='text-align: center;'>\
  <span style='font-size: 20px;'>Welcome to StratCon, Commander!</span></div>\
  <br>This isn't just about firing a few lasers; it's about controlling the entire battlefield.\
  \ Deploy your units wisely across diverse terrains \u2014 icy wastelands, scorching deserts, you name\
  \ it. Use the hex grid to outmaneuver and out think the enemy.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Key Features:\
  <br>Unit Management:</b> Keep your lances in top fighting shape. Deploy smartly, handle repairs,\
  \, and ensure your warriors are ready for the next engagement. A well-prepared lance is a winning\
  \ lance.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Scouting:</b> Send out scouts to reveal enemy positions and trigger scenarios. Sometimes,\
  \ the best move is to cut your losses and keep those scouts alive for future intel. Trust me, a\
  \ live scout today means a victory tomorrow.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Strategic Command:</b> Deploy your forces across the map to capture key objectives and\
  \ manage multiple tracks. Keep your personnel and machines combat-ready at all times. Remember,\
  \ deployed units take time to return-plan your deployments carefully to avoid being caught off-guard.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Dynamic Scenarios:</b> You'll face everything from recon missions to base defenses and\
  \ full-blown assaults. Expect to encounter Meks, tanks, DropShips, and even aerospace fighters.\
  \ Be prepared for anything.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Managing Victory Points:</b> It's not just about winning battles; it's about winning the\
  \ war. Focus on your Contract Victory Points (CVP) to keep your contract score high. These\
  \ determine if you'll succeed on the contract. Scenario Victory Points (SVP) are only for winning\
  \ individual battles. Keep your CVP high to ensure ultimate victory, while managing SVPs to\
  \ succeed in the here and now.\
  <br>\
  <br>Remember, Commander, victory isn't just about firepower; it's about strategy, foresight, and\
  \ making every decision count.</body></html>
