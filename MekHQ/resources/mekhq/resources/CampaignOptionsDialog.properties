## StratCon Notice
stratConPromo.title=+++ INCOMING TRANSMISSION +++
stratConPromo.message=<html><body style='width: 500px'><br><div style='text-align: center;'><span style='font-size: 20px;'>Welcome to StratCon, Commander!</span></div>\
  <br>This isn't just about firing a few lasers; it's about controlling the entire battlefield. Deploy your units wisely across diverse terrains - icy wastelands, scorching deserts, you name it. Use the hex grid to outmaneuver and out think the enemy.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Key Features:\
  <br>Unit Management:</b> Keep your lances in top fighting shape. Deploy smartly, handle repairs, and ensure your warriors are ready for the next engagement. A well-prepared lance is a winning lance.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Scouting:</b> Send out scouts to reveal enemy positions and trigger scenarios. Sometimes, the best move is to cut your losses and keep those scouts alive for future intel. Trust me, a live scout today means a victory tomorrow.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Strategic Command:</b> Deploy your forces across the map to capture key objectives and manage multiple tracks. Keep your personnel and machines combat-ready at all times. Remember, deployed units take time to return-plan your deployments carefully to avoid being caught off-guard.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Dynamic Scenarios:</b> You'll face everything from recon missions to base defenses and full-blown assaults. Expect to encounter Meks, tanks, DropShips, and even aerospace fighters. Be prepared for anything.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Managing Victory Points:</b> It's not just about winning battles; it's about winning the war. Focus on your Contract Victory Points (CVP) to keep your contract score high. These determine if you'll succeed on the contract. Scenario Victory Points (SVP) are only for winning individual battles. Keep your CVP high to ensure ultimate victory, while managing SVPs to succeed in the here and now.\
  <br>\
  <br>Remember, Commander, victory isn't just about firepower; it's about strategy, foresight, and making every decision count.</body></html>
