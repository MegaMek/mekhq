  <br>This isn't just about firing a few lasers; it's about controlling the entire battlefield.\
  \ Deploy your units wisely across diverse terrains \u2014 icy wastelands, scorching deserts, you name\
  \ it. Use the hex grid to outmaneuver and out think the enemy.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Key Features:\
  <br>Unit Management:</b> Keep your lances in top fighting shape. Deploy smartly, handle repairs,\
  \ and ensure your warriors are ready for the next engagement. A well-prepared lance is a winning\
  \ lance.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Scouting:</b> Send out scouts to reveal enemy positions and trigger scenarios. Sometimes,\
  \ the best move is to cut your losses and keep those scouts alive for future intel. Trust me, a\
  \ live scout today means a victory tomorrow.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Strategic Command:</b> Deploy your forces across the map to capture key objectives and\
  \ manage multiple tracks. Keep your personnel and machines combat-ready at all times. Remember,\
  \ deployed units take time to return-plan your deployments carefully to avoid being caught off-guard.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Dynamic Scenarios:</b> You'll face everything from recon missions to base defenses and\
  \ full-blown assaults. Expect to encounter Meks, tanks, DropShips, and even aerospace fighters.\
  \ Be prepared for anything.\
  <br>\
  <br><b>Managing Victory Points:</b> It's not just about winning battles; it's about winning the\
  \ war. Focus on your Contract Victory Points (CVP) to keep your contract score high. These\
  \ determine if you'll succeed on the contract. Scenario Victory Points (SVP) are only for winning\
  \ individual battles. Keep your CVP high to ensure ultimate victory, while managing SVPs to\
  \ succeed in the here and now.\
