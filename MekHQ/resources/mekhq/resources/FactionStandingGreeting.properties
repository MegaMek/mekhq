# GENERIC
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.followUp=<p>Your route to the contract system has been plotted and uploaded. Tech \
  teams are on standby to prep your forces for transport - everything should be ready by the time you reach the \
  staging bay.</p>
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.resupply.regular=<p>Plans are in place to integrate your unit into our logistics \
  network. Surplus supplies will be redirected your way monthly, but distribution will be need-based - frontline \
  units with the heaviest attrition get priority. This isn''t a replacement for standard procurement. However, if \
  you''ve got logistics vehicles you''re willing to attach to the network, we can bump your priority and ensure your \
  unit sees a larger share.</p>
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.resupply.independent=<p>You''ll be folded into our logistics network for monthly \
  redistribution of surplus supplies. Priority goes to units with the highest operational need, so don''t treat this \
  as a replacement for proper procurement. Due to command restrictions, your unit is flagged as operating \
  independently - no logistics vehicles have been assigned. If you want those supplies to reach you, you''ll need to \
  bring your own transport.</p>
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.resupply.smuggler=<p>Due to the covert nature of this assignment, standard \
  resupply will not be available. A list of local contacts has been forwarded - expect smugglers, fixers, and black \
  market agents. They''re not vetted, and they''re not clean - but they can move cargo where it needs to go.</p>
FactionStandingGreeting.outOfCharacter.resupply=This contract requires an estimated {0}-tons of cargo space among \
  <a href=''GLOSSARY:{1}''>Convoy Forces</a> in your <a href=''GLOSSARY:{2}''>TO&E</a>. You currently have {3}-tons \
  available.\

# STANDING_LEVEL_0
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.0=This is {0}, acting liaison for your unit. Make no mistake - \
  your presence is not welcome. Your record reads like a threat assessment. Command insisted on this mission. I \
  wouldn''t have.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.1=You''re here because someone upstairs signed off on it. I''m \
  {0}, liaison assigned to your unit. I''ll be flagging every move you make. Step out of line, and your protection ends.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.2=I am {0}. I''ve been instructed to oversee your participation \
  in this operation. I don''t care why Command hired you, but I''ll be watching for the moment they regret it.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.3=This channel is monitored. I am {0}, your assigned liaison. \
  Your involvement is... controversial. Don''t mistake this mission for forgiveness.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.4=You shouldn''t be here. But someone decided to use your skills\
  \ - desperation makes fools of us all. I''m {0}. Complete the mission, take your pay, and disappear.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.5=Against my better judgment, you''ve been cleared for this \
  operation. I am {0}, liaison. I advise you to stay out of sight, keep your comms short, and remember - no one \
  wants you around.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.6=This is {0}, your liaison. I''ve read your dossier. Frankly, \
  if it were up to me, you''d already be in a ditch. But here we are. Do the job and don''t talk to anyone unless you\
  \ have to.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.7=I am {0}, assigned liaison. You''re a political liability, a \
  security risk, and a walking violation of every standing order. Still, you have a mission. Stay useful or get gone.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.8=This is {0}. I''ve been assigned to keep you on-task, not to \
  make conversation. You''re a danger to everyone around you, so don''t confuse this mission for trust - it''s not \
  even close.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.9=I''m {0}, your liaison for this disaster waiting to happen. \
  Command says we need bodies. That''s the only reason you''re here. Stay out of my way.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.10=Consider this your one and only leash. I''m {0}, and if you \
  break protocol once, I''ll be the first to pull the trigger.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.11=You''re toxic, and everyone in this command knows it. I''m \
  {0}, assigned to oversee this mess. You''re not here because you''re good - you''re here because you''re expendable.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.12=Let''s not pretend this is anything but a bad idea. I''m {0}.\
  \ My job is to make sure your wreckage doesn''t splash on the rest of us. Do your job and get gone.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.13=You''ve made a lot of enemies. I''m {0}, and frankly, this \
  whole operation smells like a setup. If I were you, I wouldn''t get too comfortable.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.14=Welcome to the job - against every standing recommendation. \
  I''m {0}, liaison by necessity. You were brought on for results, not redemption. Don''t forget it.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.15=You''re not welcome here, but here you are. I''m {0}, \
  assigned to this fiasco. You''re being used, not forgiven. Don''t confuse the two.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.16=Let''s keep this simple. I''m {0}. You have a mission. \
  That''s it. You''ve burned every bridge - don''t expect me to help rebuild them.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.17=This is {0}. I''ll be your liaison - unfortunately. \
  Command''s desperate, not blind. One mistake, and this deal ends with a body bag.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.18=I''m {0}, and this assignment is a disgrace to our standards.\
  \ I''m not here to like you. Don''t talk, don''t linger, just finish the job and vanish.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_0.19=I''m {0}. The fact that you''re under assignment is a political \
  embarrassment. Everyone up the chain expects this to go wrong. Prove them wrong - or prove them right fast.
# STANDING_LEVEL_1
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.0=This is {0}, assigned liaison. I''m not thrilled about this \
  arrangement. Your presence sets people on edge - and for good reason. Do your job, keep your distance, and don''t \
  expect a warm reception.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.1=I''m {0}. Let''s be clear: you''re under assignment, not trust. \
  People remember what you''ve done. Just deliver, and maybe we''ll let you leave in peace.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.2=This is {0}, your point of contact. I''ve been instructed to \
  coordinate with you - barely. We haven''t forgotten who you are, and you won''t get a second chance if things go \
  sideways.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.3=You''re a known problem, but someone up the chain thinks you \
  can still be useful. I''m {0}, your liaison. Keep it clean and quiet, and maybe this won''t end in scandal.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.4=I''m {0}. You''ve been cleared for this op, but don''t mistake \
  that for forgiveness. You''ve made a lot of enemies. You''d be wise not to add me to the list.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.5=This is {0}, liaison assigned to your unit. Your reputation \
  precedes you, and not in a good way. You''re here to work, not to be seen. Let''s keep it that way.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.6=You''re not popular here, and neither am I for being assigned \
  to you. I''m {0}. Don''t cause trouble, and I won''t add my voice to the ones calling for your hanging.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.7=I am {0}, your liaison for this mission. I won''t lie - your \
  name raises eyebrows and lowers expectations. Prove you''re worth the risk, or at least don''t make things worse.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.8=I''m {0}. I''ll be managing your unit''s deployment, against \
  my better judgment. This may be your last chance to prove you''re more useful than dangerous.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.9=Consider this damage control. I''m {0}. You''re not welcome, \
  but you''re here. Complete the mission, stay out of the way, and maybe Command forgets you''re here.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.10=You''re walking a razor''s edge. I''m {0}, liaison for this \
  mission. I don''t trust you, and neither does anyone else. Just finish the job and don''t talk too much.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.11=This is {0}. You''ve been marked, not forgotten. I''ll keep \
  this simple - complete the mission, follow orders, and don''t test how thin Command''s patience really is.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.12=You''re a liability with a mission. I''m {0}, tasked with \
  managing this mess. Deliver results - nothing more, nothing less. Redemption isn''t on the table.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.13=I don''t need to remind you that you''re on thin ice. I''m \
  {0}, liaison. You know the deal - succeed, and you might stop being a pariah. Fail, and you''ll be erased.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.14=This is {0}. Your record made this assignment a political \
  landmine. Stay quiet, do your job, and don''t make my position worse than it already is.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.15=This is {0}. I''ve reviewed your file - it reads more like a \
  list of warnings than qualifications. Still, orders are orders. Keep things clean, and maybe no one notices you \
  were here.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.16=I''m {0}, liaison for this operation. You''ve got a talent \
  for surviving fallout - let''s hope you don''t cause more of it here. Deliver results and stay in the background.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.17=Your assignment came through with more red flags than \
  requisition forms. I''m {0}. If you''re trying to rebuild your name, start by staying out of my reports.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.18=This is {0}, your liaison. You''ve left a trail, and trust \
  me, it''s not flattering. You''re being watched. Don''t give us a reason to shut this down mid-mission.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_1.19=You weren''t the first choice. Or the second. I''m {0}, and \
  I''ll be managing this mission as long as you don''t screw it up. Prove the critics wrong.
# STANDING_LEVEL_2
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.0=This is {0}, liaison for your unit. I''ve read your record. \
  People talk when your name comes up - and not kindly. You''ve got clearance for now, but don''t push your luck.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.1=I''m {0}. You''ve earned a reputation - just not the kind that\
  \ opens doors. Command authorized this mission, not out of trust, but necessity. Let''s keep this clean.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.2=This is {0}, assigned to monitor your deployment. You''re \
  under close observation. Complete your objectives, keep your head down, and maybe the rumors won''t get worse.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.3=You''ve made a name for yourself, though not one most would \
  say aloud. I''m {0}, liaison on this op. You''re here to do a job. Nothing more.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.4=Your reputation precedes you - and follows, like smoke from a \
  fire. I''m {0}, overseeing your mission. I guess Command hopes you''re more of a threat to our enemies than to us.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.5=Let''s not pretend this is a normal assignment. I''m {0}, and \
  I''ll be your liaison. This isn''t about trust - it''s about outcomes. Deliver or disappear.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.6=This is {0}. You''ve been cleared for deployment, but don''t \
  expect anyone here to welcome you. Do the job, and maybe we won''t have to do damage control afterward.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.7=I''m {0}, acting liaison. I won''t sugarcoat it - your \
  presence sets off alarm bells. You''re being watched. Don''t give us a reason to turn observation into intervention.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.8=You''ve got a reputation for getting results - and for leaving\
  \ scorched earth behind. I''m {0}. Make this a clean op, and maybe you''ll start repairing what''s left of your \
  reputation.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.9=I''m {0}. You''re on the roster, but no one''s happy about it.\
  \ Your past casts a long shadow. Just stay on-mission and off the radar, and we won''t have a problem.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.10=This is {0}, military liaison. You''re not here because we \
  trust you. You''re here because someone thinks you''re dangerous enough to be useful. Don''t prove them wrong.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.11=I''m {0}, liaison for this operation. You''ve got a name \
  people whisper about in mess halls. Try not to give them another reason to.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.12=You''re a known quantity, and not the comforting kind. I''m \
  {0}, overseeing this assignment. Do the job, take the pay, and don''t leave a mess behind.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.13=I don''t need to like you. I just need you to follow orders. \
  I''m {0}. If you make this op about your reputation, you won''t like the fallout.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.14=You''re cleared for this mission - barely. I''m {0}. We''ll \
  keep things businesslike, but understand: one misstep, and you''ll be gone faster than you arrived.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.15=This is {0}. Your dossier reads like a case file. Command \
  authorized you under protest. Don''t give them a reason to call it a mistake.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.16=I''ve been assigned to you as liaison - {0}. Don''t expect \
  favors, leniency, or small talk. Just results. Anything less will be noted.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.17=I am {0}, liaison on record. I know your history, and so does\
  \ everyone else. This mission is a risk. Make sure it''s not a regret.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.18=You''ve left a trail of complications behind you. I''m {0}. \
  Let''s keep this mission simple: complete your objectives, minimize friction, and stay off the radar.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_2.19=You''re not the worst I''ve worked with - but you''re close. \
  I''m {0}, assigned liaison. The bar''s low. Please don''t trip over it.
# STANDING_LEVEL_3
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.0=This is {0}, liaison assigned to your unit. You''re cleared \
  for operations, but don''t mistake that for confidence. We''ll be watching closely.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.1=I''m {0}. Your name raised some flags, but you''ve been \
  greenlit for this mission. Just keep it quiet, clean, and professional. Trust, if it ever comes, will take time.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.2=I''m {0}, liaison for this deployment. There''s some \
  discomfort about your assignment, but the job needs doing. You''ll earn your place - or confirm the doubts.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.3=This is {0}. Your involvement was... debated. I''ll be \
  monitoring your performance. The mission is real. The trust is conditional.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.4=Welcome aboard, reluctantly. I''m {0}, and I''ll be watching \
  your deployment. You''ve got work - use it to clean your name, or at least stop making it worse.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.5=I''m {0}, assigned to oversee your operations. Let''s keep \
  this strictly mission-focused. You''re tolerated - for now. Don''t confuse that for approval.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.6=You''re a known variable. I''m {0}. This mission was approved,\
  \ but not without reservations. Stay sharp and stay on mission - we''ll handle the rest.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.7=I''m {0}, liaison for this assignment. You''ve got clearance, \
  barely. Don''t give the skeptics more ammo. Everyone''s watching - try not to justify their fears.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.8=Command isn''t convinced, but they''re willing to see what you\
  \ can deliver. I''m {0}, and I''ll be your point of contact. Prove this wasn''t a mistake.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.9=You''re on thin ice - but ice all the same. I''m {0}, and my \
  job is to make sure you stay on task. No drama. No missteps. Just results.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.10=I''m {0}, your liaison. You''ve been authorized for this \
  mission, but don''t expect enthusiasm. Deliver results, keep your head down, and maybe this gets easier.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.11=This is {0}. You''re not the preferred choice, but you''re \
  the only one I''ve got. Complete the assignment without incident - we''ll go from there.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.12=I''ve been tasked to monitor your role in this operation. \
  I''m {0}. Let''s make it simple: do your job, avoid unnecessary attention, and we''ll call it even.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.13=Your record has some rough edges. I''m {0}, assigned liaison.\
  \ The brass approved this deployment, but you''re on review every step of the way.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.14=Command''s decision to choose you was... pragmatic. I''m {0}. \
  You''re not trusted, but you''re tolerated. Prove they were right to take the risk.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.15=I''m {0}. You''ve got the mission, but it comes with extra \
  scrutiny. If you want fewer eyes on you, give them nothing to see.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.16=This is {0}, liaison assigned to your unit. There''s no \
  welcoming party. Just expectations. Meet them, and we won''t have a problem.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.17=You''re under assignment, but not off the hook. I''m {0}. \
  Keep things tight and professional, and don''t make me file an incident report.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.18=You''ve got authorization. I''m {0}, overseeing your activity\
  . Let''s be clear - this is cooperation, not trust. There''s a difference.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_3.19=Your deployment was a compromise. I''m {0}, and I''ll be \
  monitoring your conduct. Treat this as a test - because that''s exactly what it is.
# STANDING_LEVEL_4
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.0=This is {0}, assigned liaison. I don''t know you, and no \
  one''s offered an opinion. Let''s keep it that way - complete the mission, and we''ll see what you''re made of.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.1=I''m {0}, your liaison for this assignment. You''ve got no \
  track record here. Stay on mission, and we''ll find out whether you''re worth remembering.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.2=Welcome to the op. I''m {0}. You''ve come in clean - no \
  baggage, no favors. Treat this as your first impression. Make it a good one.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.3=This is {0}. You''re new to us, so we''ll keep this simple: \
  follow orders, hit your marks, and maybe we''ll have something to talk about next time.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.4=I''m {0}, liaison to your unit. Your file is light, but \
  that''s not always a bad thing. Just focus on performance - we''ll judge from there.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.5=You''re on the books, and that''s all. I''m {0}. No \
  expectations, no assumptions. Just do the job and stay professional."
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.6=This is {0}, mission liaison. You''re a blank slate here. \
  Whether you rise, fall, or disappear is up to you.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.7=I''ve got no reason to doubt you - and no reason to vouch for \
  you. I''m {0}. Do your part, and maybe next time I''ll remember your name.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.8=You''re clear for the op. I''m {0}, and I don''t play politics. \
  Execute well and stay out of the debrief headlines - that''s all that matters.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.9=I''m {0}. You''ve got no history with this command, and that \
  buys you a clean shot. Let''s see what you do with it.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.10=I''m {0}, your liaison for this mission. No one here has \
  strong feelings about you - which means you''ve got room to build a reputation. Good or bad.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.11=This is {0}. You''ve been authorized for this op. No \
  opinions, no expectations. Show us what you bring to the field.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.12=You''re new to this theater. I''m {0}, and I''ll be handling \
  coordination. Keep things tight, keep them clean, and we''ll get along fine.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.13=You''ve got no red flags and no commendations on your file. \
  I''m {0}, liaison assigned to your mission. Let''s keep it straightforward.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.14=This is {0}. You''ve got a mission, a clean record, and a \
  shot. Prove you''re worth more than just a line on a roster.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.15=I don''t know you, and I don''t need to - yet. I''m {0}, your\
  \ assigned liaison. You''ve got work. Let''s see how you handle it.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.16=I''m {0}. Your unit doesn''t ring any alarms or bells. This \
  is a clean-slate mission. Treat it like your first impression - because it is.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.17=You''re in the system now. I''m {0}, overseeing your \
  assignment. Finish the job, and you''ll have a starting point for something more.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.18=This is {0}. You''ve got a record of nothing - which isn''t \
  always a bad thing. Do the work, and we''ll see if you''re worth remembering.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_4.19=I''m {0}, your liaison. No baggage. No backing. Just a job. \
  Make it count or move on quietly.
# STANDING_LEVEL_5
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.0=This is {0}, liaison assigned to your unit. Your record shows \
  consistent results - command trusts you to handle this one without oversight. Make good on that trust.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.1=I''m {0}. I''ve seen your work, and it holds up. You''ve got a\
  \ solid rep around here - keep it up, and the missions won''t stop coming.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.2=Welcome. I''m {0}, your liaison for this operation. You''ve \
  earned some respect around here, even if it''s quiet. Let''s keep it that way - clean, fast, effective.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.3=You''re on the list of units we don''t have to worry about. \
  That''s worth something. I''m {0}, and I''ll be managing this assignment. Let''s get to work.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.4=You''ve got a reputation for getting things done - nothing \
  flashy, but reliable. I''m {0}, and I''ll be coordinating this op. Good to have you on board.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.5=This is {0}, liaison contact. You''re not a household name, but\
  \ you''ve made your mark. Command approved this assignment without hesitation. That says something.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.6=You''ve earned a place on the roster, and people have noticed.\
  \ I''m {0}, and I''ll be your point of contact. Let''s keep your win streak intact.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.7=I''m {0}. You''ve got a solid track record - enough that we \
  don''t need to second-guess your involvement. Handle this like you usually do.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.8=Good to see a familiar name on the roster. I''m {0}, your \
  liaison. No red flags, no hesitation - just business with someone who''s proven themselves.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.9=I''ll keep this short. You''ve shown you can deliver. I''m \
  {0}, assigned to your unit. Do what you do, and we''ll have no problems.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.10=I''m {0}, your liaison for this op. Your name came up with no\
  \ objections. That''s more than most can say. Keep doing what you do.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.11=This is {0}. You''ve earned a reputation as someone who \
  doesn''t waste time. That''s exactly the kind of support we need on this deployment.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.12=I''m {0}, and your reliability hasn''t gone unnoticed. Let''s\
  \ keep the trend going.
FactionStandingGreeting.inCharacter.greeting.STANDING_LEVEL_5.13=I''m {0}, liaison on this assignment. You''re not flashy, but\
