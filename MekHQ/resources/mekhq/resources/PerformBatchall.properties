performBatchall.clanName.prefix.empire=Empire
performBatchall.clanName.prefix.the=the
performBatchall.clanName.formatted={0} Clan
## Response Options
performBatchall.intro.0=(Bid) Our battle will be legendary!
performBatchall.intro.1=(Bid) Well bargained and done.
performBatchall.intro.2=(Bid) It''s not like I have much of a choice...
performBatchall.intro.3=(Refuse Batchall) Is this some kind of joke?
performBatchall.intro.4=(Refuse Batchall) You do not deserve the honor of a Trial.
# OOC Messages
performBatchall.intro.ooc=If you accept the Batchall, MekHQ will simulate the bidding process before each scenario. The\
  \ Clan forces will bid away units until they are left with the lowest number of forces they believe can conquer yours.\
  <p>Even when accepting the Batchall, fighting Clan forces - especially as the Inner Sphere - can be very challenging.\
  \ If the contract starts turning against you, remember this: it''s better to lose a contract than lose your entire\
  \ campaign. Never let your pride stand in the way of keeping your personnel alive and your ''Meks intact.</p>\
  <p>If you refuse the Batchall, you will face the full might of the Clan war machine. A true challenge for those with\
  \ the guts to try it.</p>
## ARE YOU SURE?
performBatchall.areYouSure.inCharacter={0}, are you sure about this?
performBatchall.areYouSure.outOfCharacter=You will face the full strength of the Clans during this contract, and they\
  \ will regard you less favorably in future dealings.
performBatchall.areYouSure.button.cancel=(Bid) On second thoughts, maybe not...
performBatchall.areYouSure.button.confirm=(Refuse Batchall) Send the message.
# BATCHALL STATEMENTS
## Batchall Not Possible

  <p><b>{0}</b> comes for you.</p>
performBatchall.batchall.tooLowStanding.ooc=Your Faction Standing has fallen too low, and this Clan will no longer \
  honor you with a Batchall. You are about to face the full might of the Clan war machine. Good luck, you''ll need it.\
  <p>If the contract starts turning against you, remember this: it''s better to lose a contract than lose your entire\
  \ campaign. Never let your pride stand in the way of keeping your personnel alive and your ''Meks intact.</p>
