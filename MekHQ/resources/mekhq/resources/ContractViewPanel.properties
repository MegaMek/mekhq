txtStratConTutorial.text=<h2>Scenarios</h2>\
  Each scenario represents a strategic opportunity identified by <b>Allied Command</b> - either to advance your goals\
  \ or stop the enemy from achieving theirs. Don't try to complete every scenario - you'll quickly run out of resources.\
  \ It's your job to choose when and where to fight.\
  <p>You must decide whether to engage or ignore each scenario. To <b>refuse an engagement</b>, simply advance the day\
  \ past the scenario''s scheduled date. But be warned: refusing a scenario counts as a <b>decisive defeat</b> for enemy\
  \ morale calculations.</p>\
  <p>If you've already deployed forces to a scenario but then refuse to fight, it only counts as a <b>normal defeat</b>.\
  \ This is because the enemy must still account for your presence, limiting their strategic options - a concept known\
  \ as a "fleet in being."</p>\
  <h2>Campaign Victory Points (CVP)</h2>\
  In <b>StratCon</b>, you must end a contract with a positive CVP score. Even if all other objectives are met, finishing\
  \ with 0 or negative CVP results in only a <b>Partial Success</b>.\
  <ul><li>+1 CVP for each successful <b>Turning Point</b> scenario.</li>\
  <li>-1 CVP for each Turning Point loss.</li>\
  <li><b>Crisis</b> scenarios: -1 CVP for a loss or draw. No CVP is awarded for a win.</li></ul>\
  <h2>Combat Roles</h2>\
  Upon arrival in a target system, assign your forces to combat roles (bottom left corner). Each role serves a specific\
  \ purpose:\
  <ul><li><b>Frontline:</b> Enables scenario support with minefields or infantry (if available).</li>\
  <li><b>Maneuver</b> & <b>Auxiliary:</b> Increase the chance of successful reinforcement.</li>\
  <li><b>Training:</b> Allows veteran units to train subordinates.</li>\
  <li><b>Patrol:</b> Increases the radius of hexes that will be revealed when deploying to the AO by 1. Will never be\
  \ ambushed by enemy forces unless deployed to a hex still covered by fog of war. Will not scan adjacent hexes if\
  \ deployed to a scenario.</li>\
  <li><b>Auxiliary:</b> Also used to assign <b>Leadership</b> units - bonus units deployed based on the force leader's\
  \ Leadership skill. Forces assigned to this role cannot be directly deployed to scenarios.</li>\
  <li><b>Reserve:</b> Default role. Forces here can't be deployed and are ignored for combat purposes.</li></ul>\
  <h2>Support Points (SP)</h2>\
  In <b>StratCon</b>, you earn <b>Support Points</b> when you accept a contract and periodically during the contract,\
  \ based on the <b>Administration</b> skill of your <b>Admin/Transport</b> personnel.\
  <p>Support Points represent your employer''s willingness to assist your operations. You can spend them in three key\
  \ ways:</p>\
  <ul><li>Requesting additional air and ground cover, making it possible (and easier) to reinforce scenarios.</li>\
  <li>Exchanging influence in <b>Mercenary Auctions</b> to acquire units for free.</li>\
  <li>Convincing wandering <b>Ronin</b> to join your cause instead of siding with another ally.</li></ul>\
  <p>Use Support Points wisely - you don''t want to be caught needing reinforcements with no employer support left to\
  \ spend.</p>\
  <h2>Reinforcing Scenarios</h2>\
  In <b>StratCon</b>, you''ll sometimes face overwhelming odds. Fortunately, you can reinforce scenarios to turn the tide.\
  <p>To reinforce:</p>\
  <ol><li>Deploy your <b>Primary Combat Team</b> (the first force assigned to the scenario).</li>\
  <li>Right-click on the scenario and select <b>Manage Reinforcements</b>.</li></ol>\
  <p>You must have at least <b>1 Support Point</b> to attempt reinforcement. You can spend additional Support Points to\
  \ reduce the scenario''s <b>Target Number</b> - a difficulty score based on:</p>\
  <ul><li>Contract balance of power (enemy morale)</li>\
  <li>Enemy skill level</li>\
  <li>The <b>Administration</b> skill of your highest-ranking <b>Admin/Command</b> character</li></ul>\
  <p>If the <b>Reinforcement Check</b> fails, reinforcements may arrive late - or be intercepted. Weigh your available\
  \ Support Points against the risk of failure before committing.</p>
