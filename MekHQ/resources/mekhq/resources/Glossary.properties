### A

AREA_OF_OPERATIONS.title=Area of Operations
AREA_OF_OPERATIONS.definition=In <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>, the Area of Operations\
  \ does not represent the entire planet. Instead, it consists of a collection of Sectors assigned\
  \ to your unit. These Sectors contain objectives, scenarios, and sometimes special\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON_FACILITIES'>Facilities</a>.

ATB.title=Digital GM: Legacy Against the Bot
ATB.definition=Against the Bot (AtB) is one of the oldest systems in MekHQ, serving as an early\
  \ attempt at creating a <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a>.\
  <p>In late 2024, Legacy AtB was officially succeeded by <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>\
  \ and is now considered <a href='GLOSSARY:DEPRECATED'>Deprecated</a>.

### B

### C

CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS.title=Contract Victory Points
CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS.definition=Contract Victory Points (CVP) represent an abstract measure of\
  \ your contract's overall strategic success. Most contracts require a positive CVP to be\
  \ considered successful. Even if all other objectives are met, having a neutral or negative CVP\
  \ will result in a failure or, at best, a Partial Success.\
  <p>CVP should not be confused with <a href='GLOSSARY:SCENARIO_VICTORY_POINTS'>Scenario Victory\
  \ Points (SVP)</a>.

### D

DEPRECATED.title=Deprecated
DEPRECATED.definition=A deprecated system or option is no longer actively developed or supported.\
  \ While these systems remain available, they will eventually be removed if they become too broken\
  \ to maintain easily.

DIGITAL_GM.title=Digital GM
DIGITAL_GM.definition=In MekHQ, a Digital GM refers to any system designed to replace a human GM in\
  \ campaign play.\
  <p>Currently, there are two Digital GMs available: <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a> and\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:ATB'>Legacy Against the Bot</a> (Deprecated)</p>

### E

### F

FATIGUE.title=Fatigue
FATIGUE.definition=Fatigue represents how exhausted a character is from their experiences. It is\
  \ typically accumulated through exploring the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of\
  \ Operations</a> in <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>, sustaining injuries (if this is\
  \ enabled in Campaign Options), and participating in scenarios.\
  <p>High fatigue can affect performance in scenarios (if TacOps Fatigue is enabled in MegaMek\
  \ Options) and may also influence a character's likelihood of resigning.</p>\
  <p>The core rules for Reputation can be found in Campaign Operations, with additional rules\
  \ available in:\
  <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module.pdf</i></p>

LOYALTY.title=Loyalty
LOYALTY.definition=Loyalty represents how committed a character is to your cause. Characters with\
  \ higher loyalty are less likely to resign. Loyalty can fluctuate over time due to your decisions\
  \ and personal life events, such as marriage or having children.\
  <p>For more details on Loyalty and its effects, refer to the documentation in:\
  <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Turnover & Retention Module.pdf</i></p>

### P

PRISONER_CAPACITY.title=Prisoner Capacity
PRISONER_CAPACITY.definition=Prisoner Capacity represents the number of prisoners your security\
  \ personnel can effectively manage without risking a crisis. Typically, each prisoner occupies\
  \ one unit of capacity, though certain events may alter this value.\
  <p>For more details on Prisoner Capacity and its management, refer to the documentation in:\
  <br><i>MekHQ/docs/Personnel Modules/Prisoners, Defection & Dependents.pdf</i></p>

### Q

### R

REPUTATION.title=Reputation
REPUTATION.definition=Reputation reflects how well-known your unit is and whether others trust your\
  \ ability to complete missions.\
  <p>Detailed rules on Reputation can be found in <i>Campaign Operations.</i></p>

### S

SCENARIO_VICTORY_POINTS.title=Scenario Victory Points
SCENARIO_VICTORY_POINTS.definition=Scenario Victory Points (SVP) determine the outcome of an\
  \ individual scenario. A negative SVP results in a Defeat. A neutral SVP leads to a Draw. A\
  \ positive SVP counts as a Victory.\
  <p>Keep in mind that many scenarios offer multiple paths to victory - you don't need to complete\
  \ every objective to succeed.</p>\
  <p>SVP should not be confused with <a href='GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS'>Contract Victory\
  \ Points (CVP)</a>.</p>

STRATCON.title=Digital GM: StratCon
STRATCON.definition=Introduced in 2021, StratCon officially replaced <a href='GLOSSARY:ATB'>Against\
  \ the Bot</a> as the premier <a href='GLOSSARY:DIGITAL_GM'>Digital GM</a>.\
  <p>StratCon enables you to engage in battles across an entire\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a>, tackle challenging scenarios, and\
  \ collect salvage. It also tracks prisoners of war, generates contracts and scenarios, manages\
  \ special objectives, and much more.</p>

STRATCON_FACILITIES.title=StratCon Facilities
STRATCON_FACILITIES.definition=In <a href='GLOSSARY:STRATCON'>StratCon</a>, the\
  \ <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a> may contain special facilities.\
  \ These facilities can be controlled by either your forces or the enemy and may apply unique\
  \ modifiers to your scenarios.\
  <p>If you're experiencing negative scenario modifiers from an enemy-controlled facility, it is\
  \ crucial to locate and neutralize (or capture) it. Poor modifiers from enemy facilities can mean\
  \ the difference between a tough fight and a complete massacre.</p>

### T

TURNING_POINT.title=Turning Point Scenarios
TURNING_POINT.definition=Turning Points are scenarios of significant strategic importance. The\
  \ exact reason a scenario is designated as a Turning Point is left to your interpretation. It\
  \ could be a battle over a critical location, an engagement with a high-ranking enemy officer, or\
  \ simply a mission under heightened scrutiny from Allied Command.<p>Winning a Turning Point\
  \ scenario grants you 1 <a href='GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS'>Contract Victory Point\
  \ (CVP)</a>. Losing, however, deducts 1 CVP and may push your score into negative territory.
