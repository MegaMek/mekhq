FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ooc=Your standing with {0} is on the rise.
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.innerSphere={9}, our unit''s been flagged in recent data requests \
  traced back to {10}''s internal military and administrative systems. From what I can tell, this is tied directly to \
  our support operations in the region.\
  <p>They''re impressed. We''ve earned a reputation within as a dependable and capable presence, and it looks like \
  their command structure is starting to take us seriously.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep the pressure steady and the results clean. They could become a useful ally - or at the very least, a \
  friendly DropPort.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CC={9}, our unit has shown up in several high-level search logs \
  from within the Confederation''s military command structure. It''s clear we''ve attracted attention from above.\
  <p>That could mean opportunity - or increased scrutiny. Either way, we need to stay sharp and keep our record clean. \
  The Chancellor doesn''t watch casually.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.DC={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls \
  originating from Combine High Command. We are being observed.\
  <p>This is not unexpected, given our recent record. Recognition from above is earned - but it also brings increased \
  expectations. The Dragon does not reward lightly, nor forgive failure.</p>\
  <p>I recommend we operate with absolute precision. Now is the time to prove we are worthy of the attention we''ve \
  drawn.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.LA={9}, I ran a routine systems check and found that our unit''s \
  name has come up in several flagged searches from LCAF senior staff. We''ve clearly landed on someone''s radar.\
  <p>Given our recent performance, I''d say this is the start of something bigger - assignments, evaluations, maybe even \
  patronage. Of course, it also means we''ll be under closer scrutiny.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure what they see keeps us moving up, not sideways.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FS={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent searches coming out \
  of Federated Suns High Command. It looks like we''ve drawn attention from above.\
  <p>Given how we''ve been performing, it''s not a surprise - but it is a responsibility. They''re watching now, and that \
  means every move counts more than ever.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep showing them that their trust - or curiosity - is well-placed.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FWL={9}, I''ve reviewed recent network activity, and our unit has \
  been flagged in multiple search queries from different branches of League command. We''re on the radar now - possibly \
  in more than one bloc.\
  <p>That could open doors, or it could mean someone''s sizing us up. Either way, we should stay sharp and keep our \
  profile clean. In the League, attention from above can shift quickly - best we guide it, not chase it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TH={9}, our unit has been flagged in multiple high-clearance \
  search protocols traced back to Hegemony Command. We''re officially on their watchlist - likely under performance review.\
  <p>This isn''t cause for concern - yet. It''s a signal that our actions are aligning with greater strategic interests. In\
  \ the Hegemony, recognition from above often precedes increased expectations.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure we continue to operate in a way that honors the legacy we represent.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.ROS={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent search activity \
  originating from upper echelons of Republic Command. We''re clearly under review - most likely due to our recent field\
  \ performance.\
  <p>This kind of attention could lead to expanded responsibilities. It also means we''ll be held to a higher standard \
  from here on out.</p>\
  <p>Let''s make sure we continue to reflect the values this Republic was built on - stability, integrity, and trust.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.SL={9}, our unit has been flagged in multiple search queries \
  issued by central Star League command. We appear to be under observation by higher strategic authorities.\
  <p>This likely reflects our operational record to date - and signals that we may be considered for more critical \
  assignments. The League does not act without purpose.</p>\
  <p>Let''s ensure that everything we do from this point forward upholds the ideals we serve: unity, order, and the \
  preservation of peace.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.FC={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent data pulls from the \
  Federated Commonwealth''s joint command systems. We''ve drawn the eye of higher leadership - likely in recognition of \
  our recent actions.\
  <p>That kind of visibility comes with opportunity - and scrutiny. Let''s stay focused and disciplined. If we''re being \
  watched, let''s give them something worth backing.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.periphery={9}, we''ve been flagged in a string of intel queries \
  coming from inside {10} - government channels, militia databases, even administrative logs. From the look of it, word \
  of our recent actions on their behalf is spreading fast.\
  <p>They''re watching us now, not as a threat, but as an asset. A force that gets results.</p>\
  <p>Might be worth leaning into that. Relationships like this don''t happen often out here - and when they do, they \
  can pay off in ways C-Bills can''t.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.RWR={9}, our unit has appeared in recent search activity \
  originating from Rim Worlds central authority. We''ve drawn attention from the upper chain - possibly the Directorate \
  itself.\
  <p>This could mean recognition. It could also mean evaluation. Either way, we continue forward with \
  discipline and absolute alignment to the Republic''s vision.</p>\
  <p>Stay sharp. In the Republic, attention is never neutral.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.TC={9}, our unit''s been flagged in recent searches by senior \
  Concordat defense officials. Word''s gotten around - we''ve made an impression.\
  <p>That kind of attention can mean trust, or testing. Either way, it''s on us to show we''re worth the faith. Let''s \
  keep doing what we''ve been doing - clean, solid work that speaks louder than promises ever could.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MOC={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent strategic reviews \
  coming out of Magistracy high command. It''s clear we''ve attracted some attention - likely due to our recent \
  effectiveness.\
  <p>This kind of visibility tends to lead somewhere - contracts, evaluations, or possibly an invitation. Let''s make \
  sure what they see reinforces the value we bring to the Magistrix.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.OA={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent inquiry records from \
  Outworlds Alliance command. We''ve drawn some attention - likely from the Council''s strategic oversight division.\
  <p>It''s not something they do lightly. That kind of interest means they''re watching what we''re building out here - and \
  weighing what more we could take on.</p>\
  <p>Let''s keep our operations clean, precise, and true to the Alliance''s values. We didn''t ask for this attention, \
  but we''ve earned it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MH={9}, our unit has been flagged in recent data sweeps from \
  upper-tier command in the Marian Hegemony. Word is, someone close to the Caesar''s circle is watching.\
  <p>This isn''t the kind of attention we can afford to waste. Recognition here means expectation - of strength, of \
  discipline, of results. Let''s give them exactly that.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.CS={9}, our unit has been referenced in several flagged \
  information queries originating from within ComStar. The nature of the searches was...specific, and they weren''t \
  routed through public channels.\
  <p>This isn''t casual interest. The Order is aware of us - and watching.</p>\
  <p>We should proceed with caution. When ComStar looks too closely, it''s rarely just to admire the work.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.WOB={9}, our unit has appeared in recent searches traced back to \
  Word of Blake enclaves - specifically the inner doctrinal networks. The kind they don''t access without purpose.\
  <p>It''s not praise. It''s prophecy. They believe we''ve aligned with the Pattern... or that we might disrupt it.</p>\
  <p>Either way, the True Believers are looking at us now. Best we stay sharp, stay moving, and remember - attention \
  from the Word rarely ends with just observation.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.clan={9}, our unit has been marked in recent internal Watch \
  searches - originating from senior {10} command. They are watching us.\
  <p>This is not flattery. It is evaluation. Attention in the Clans is never casual - it is earned or it is provoked.</p>\
  <p>We must continue to operate with strength, clarity, and discipline. If they are measuring us, then let them find \
  proof of worth, not weakness.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MG={9}, we''ve just received notice from the Mercenary Guild:\
  \ {12} are being listed by name in contract queries. Not general mercenary requests - direct tags.\
  <p>That means one thing: someone out there isn''t looking for just warm bodies with guns. They want us. \
  Specifically.</p>\
  <p>This kind of visibility cuts both ways. On the one hand, it means our reputation''s finally putting weight on the \
  board - word of our ops is circulating, and somebody with clout took notice. Could be a payout worth chasing.</p>\
  <p>But it also means we''ve lost some of our anonymity. If we''re being shopped by name, we''re on more than one \
  radar now. That opens the door to targeted offers - but also tailored threats. Rival outfits, old enemies, or \
  clients with long memories might start circling.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRB={0}, we''ve received an official communication from ComStar''s \
  Mercenary Review Board. Not a general bulletin - a direct transmission.\
  <p>No contract attached, no details on who initiated the flag. Just a short-form notice confirming that our unit file\
  \ has been "accessed and reviewed by multiple parties with high-clearance contracting authority." ComStar doesn't \
  name names, but the implication is clear: someone''s vetting us at a high level, and they''re doing it through \
  official channels.</p>\
  <p>That makes this bigger than a backroom employer or an informal probe. We''re on someone''s shortlist for serious \
  work - possibly House-level or black-budget operations. Could mean money and visibility, but also means we're about \
  to be in someone else''s game.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MRBC={9}, we''ve been contacted by the Mercenary Review and \
  Bonding Commission.\
  <p>Not standard formwork. This came encrypted, authenticated, and flagged priority. They''ve officially acknowledged \
  {12} as a unit of interest, citing "notable performance in recent operations and consistent contract \
  integrity." Translation: Wolf''s Dragoons have been watching us, and they like what they see - enough to reach out \
  directly.</p>\
  <p>No contracts attached - yet - but the MRBC doesn''t waste its breath. This feels like the start of something heavier.\
  \ Possibly front-door access to higher-grade assignments or even MRBC-coordinated deployments.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.APPEARING_IN_SEARCHES.MBA={9}, we''ve been formally contacted by the Mercenary \
  Bonding Authority, the one operated by Clan Sea Fox.\
  <p>Encrypted message, trinary-coded, and backed by a verified merchant caste credential. Not your standard \
  transmission. The content was characteristically precise: {12} have been "flagged for strategic market \
  alignment and performance-based evaluation."</p>\
  <p>They''re not just watching us. They''re weighing us - as an asset. And with the Sea Foxes, that means they see \
  value - either as a sellable brand, a deployable asset, or something worth franchising. The line between recognition \
  and acquisition is thin with them.</p>

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.innerSphere=<h2>{12} Secure Borders</h2>\
  The Ministry of Defense has confirmed the successful conclusion of a joint operations contract with the military \
  command known as {12}, led by {0}. The operation focused on stabilizing contested zones in border territories and \
  restoring control to government forces.\
  <p>{12} were contracted under emergency authority following a sharp increase in coordinated insurgent \
  activity. Over the course of several weeks, their unit engaged in rapid deployment actions, cleared key supply \
  routes, and neutralized several high-value targets.</p>\
  <p>"This was a strategic decision, not a political one," said {10} Minister of Defense Taren Voss. "Our own \
  forces were stretched. {12} had the skill and the will to respond quickly - and they delivered."</p>\
  <p>While some in the Assembly questioned the optics of relying on military adventurism, recent polling suggests \
  public opinion leans in favor of the operation, especially in provinces directly affected by the conflict.</p>\
  <p>{0} declined formal interviews, but was described by field officers as "focused, efficient, and \
  respectful of command hierarchy."</p>\
  <p>As debates continue over the future role of the military in national defense, few deny that this intervention \
  worked - and for now, {12} stand as proof that performance speaks louder than politics.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.CC=<h2>Capellan Command Praises {12}</h2>\
  In recent weeks, the military unit known as {12}, \
  operating, under contract with the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces (CCAF), has executed a series of strategic \
  operations that reflect both exceptional capability and ideological alignment with the principles of the State.\
  <p>Under the command of {0}, a tactician noted for discipline and discretion, {12} have \
  successfully neutralized hostile elements near contested regions while supporting civil infrastructure recovery \
  across multiple worlds under Confederation protection.</p>\
  <p>Military sources confirm that {12}'' conduct has garnered attention from senior elements within the \
  War College of Liao and the Ministry of Military Affairs. "Their performance has demonstrated not just competence, \
  but clarity of purpose," said one source speaking on condition of authorization. "They understand the value of \
  order."</p>\
  <p>Citizens are reminded that the Confederation welcomes those who serve with loyalty and uphold the dignity of the\
  \ Capellan cause. For now, {0} and their {12} appear to be doing exactly that.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.DC=<h2>Service to the Dragon Noted</h2>\
  The military unit known as {12}, under the \
  leadership of {0}, has recently completed a series of operations in service to the Draconis Combine. \
  These operations, sanctioned by regional DCMS command, have advanced local stability and reflected favorably on the\
  \ unit''s conduct.\
  <p>{12} have so far comported themselves with the restraint and precision expected of those who serve \
  under the Dragon''s banner. Field reports confirm they executed orders efficiently, sustaining minimal civilian \
  disruption.</p>\
  <p>High Command has declined public comment, but sources within the Internal Security Force noted the unit has \
  "acted with appropriate discipline and operational clarity." Whether further operational opportunities will be \
  extended remains at the discretion of the Coordinator''s military advisors.</p>\
  <p>Citizens are reminded that honor is revealed through service.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.LA=<h2>LCAF Acknowledges {12}</h2>\
  The Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces confirmed today that \
  {12}, a high-performing combat unit led by {0}, have completed several successful operations \
  in partnership with regional LCAF command.\
  <p>Operating in contested space, {12} demonstrated tactical effectiveness, logistical discipline, and a\
  \ professionalism that has drawn the attention of senior officers. Analysts noted their use of heavy firepower and \
  measured engagement strategies align well with established Lyran doctrine.</p>\
  <p>"I''ve worked with plenty of commands," said General Annika Rist, "But few show the kind of battlefield economy \
  and results-focused mindset we''ve seen from {0}''s unit."</p>\
  <p>Speculation is already circulating about longer-term operations or asset integration opportunities should \
  {12} continue to meet performance benchmarks.</p>\
  <p>As the Commonwealth continues to stabilize key borders and defend its economic interests, proven allies are \
  always welcome.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.FS=<h2>{12} Earn Suns'' Trust</h2>\
  Under the capable command of {0}, {12} have \
  made headlines following their recent support operations. Deployed with the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns \
  (AFFS), the unit executed coordinated strikes against destabilizing elements.\
  <p>{12} have conducted themselves with professionalism and evident loyalty to the ideals of the Suns. \
  Their actions earned commendations from regional high command and, according to insiders, may place them on a short\
  \ list for higher-priority deployments.</p>\
  <p>"{0}''s team has shown a clear commitment to protecting our citizens and preserving stability in the \
  region," said Colonel Thomas Halley of the 17th Avalon Hussars. "They may wear a different patch, but they fight \
  like one of us."</p>\
  <p>The Federated Suns has a long tradition of helping to develop commands that become household names - and \
  {12} appear well on their way to becoming a trusted name in that legacy.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.FWL=<h2>League Commends {12}</h2>\
  {12}, under the command of {0}, has \
  recently concluded a string of successful operations in the League''s outer provinces, earning attention from \
  multiple regional defense authorities.\
  <p>Operating under a League-sanctioned operation planned by the Ministry of Defense, {12} have \
  contributed to stabilization efforts along the tumultuous border zones. According to sources close to provincial \
  command channels, the unit''s performance has exceeded expectations in terms of both tactical output and political \
  restraint.</p>\
  <p>While formal statements remain guarded, an aide to a Marik bloc general - speaking anonymously - described the unit \
  as "a reliable partner with enough independence to be useful and enough discipline to avoid causing waves."</p>\
  <p>Though inter-bloc coordination remains a constant balancing act, the presence of a competent, apolitical force \
  like {12} may offer useful flexibility in future operations.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.TH=<h2>Terra Recognizes {12}</h2>\
  In a formal bulletin issued today by the Hegemony Central Security\
  \ Directorate, {12}, led by {0}, have been acknowledged for their role in resolving a \
  volatile military concern in an unnamed border region.\
  <p>Operating under classified terms with Terran High Command oversight, {12} executed several precision \
  operations supporting civilian evacuation, infrastructure defense, and interdiction of rogue elements threatening \
  Hegemony protectorate space.</p>\
  <p>The unit''s professionalism and operational restraint have drawn attention from the Ministry of Strategic \
  Planning. "{0} leads with discipline and a clear understanding of the principles that built Terra," said \
  an internal source familiar with the situation.</p>\
  <p>Analysts note this marks a rare instance of public acknowledgment from Terran High Command - an indication of both\
  \ growing trust and the weight of expectation.</p>\
  <p>As always, the Hegemony recognizes those who act not merely with power, but with purpose.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.ROS=<h2>Republic Lauds Unit''s Efforts</h2>\
  In a briefing earlier this week, Republic Command acknowledged \
  the contributions of {12}, led by {0}, for their role in reinforcing stability across \
  multiple contested systems.\
  <p>Deployed as part of a civilian-support operation, {12} provided critical assistance during \
  infrastructure recovery and repelled multiple incursions in the border zones. Their timely actions prevented \
  widespread damage to Republic commerce and civilian networks, according to the Ministry of Strategic Security.</p>\
  <p>"{0} and their unit has consistently operated with professionalism, discipline, and alignment with our \
  civic values," said Command Liaison Director Hiram Dukas. "They''ve proven themselves more than just \
  MekWarriors - they''ve acted as partners in protection."</p>\
  <p>This recognition marks a rare commendation for an auxiliary unit, a move some analysts interpret as a signal of \
  expanding flexibility in the Republic''s defense doctrine.</p>\
  <p>As the Republic continues to prioritize stability and cooperative reconstruction, forces like {12} \
  stand as proof that action defines loyalty.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.SL=<h2>Star League Commends Action</h2>\
  In a statement released today by the Office of Central Command \
  Oversight, the Star League Defense Force formally recognized {12}, under the command of {0}, \
  for their contributions to recent stability operations.\
  <p>{12} were instrumental in repelling insurgent activity, executing rapid-response strikes against \
  destabilizing forces while providing humanitarian security for Star League-aligned settlements.</p>\
  <p>"{0}''s team operated with the kind of precision and restraint we expect from League forces," said \
  General Carissa Thorne, senior SLDF logistics coordinator. "They understood the responsibility that comes with \
  power - and exercised it in the League''s best interest."</p>\
  <p>As the Star League continues its mission to unify and preserve, such operations play a vital role in securing \
  peace in our time.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.FC=<h2>Commonwealth Trusts {12}</h2>\
  In a joint statement from regional military offices, the Federated\
  \ Commonwealth has commended {12}, led by {0}, for their critical role in stabilizing \
  a number of volatile systems.\
  <p>Operating alongside Commonwealth forces on a multi-phase deployment, {12} provided tactical \
  reinforcement, interdiction support, and civilian protection during a series of fast-moving engagements. Military \
  officials cited the unit''s adaptability, professionalism, and consistent alignment with Commonwealth command \
  protocols.</p>\
  <p>"{0} leads from the front, and their unit operates with the kind of discipline and decisiveness we \
  expect from our own," said General Alaric Voight of the 3rd Royal Guards. "They''ve earned more than just a \
  medal - they''ve earned our trust."</p>\
  <p>A source close to the matter has commented that {12} are now being evaluated for continued high-level \
  operations and extended strategic partnerships may be on the table.</p>\
  <p>In a time when strength and cohesion are more important than ever, {12} stand as a sharp example of \
  what loyalty, skill, and action can accomplish.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.periphery=<h2>{10} Praises Defense Work</h2>\
  Local authorities have issued a formal statement of \
  appreciation to the military unit known as {12}, led by {0}, for their successful \
  intervention in suppressing a recent wave of insurgent activity across several rural districts.\
  <p>{12}, operating under a short-term defense contract approved by the central council, conducted \
  targeted operations against armed criminal elements believed to be operating from outside {10}''s official \
  borders. Civilian casualties were minimal, and infrastructure damage was described as "within acceptable \
  parameters."</p>\
  <p>"They came when we needed help, not promises," said Deputy Marshal Alen Varn. "They didn''t lecture us. They \
  fought."</p>\
  <p>While large forces operating in Periphery territory often face scrutiny, early reports suggest {12} \
  maintained full transparency with regional command and observed local sovereignty throughout their deployment.</p>\
  <p>For a government stretched thin by unrest, this rare display of cooperation with planetary defense has sparked \
  cautious optimism.</p>\
  <p>"We''re not in the habit of handing out medals," said Councilor Jada Kreel, "but {12} earned my \
  thanks. That doesn''t happen often."</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.RWR=<h2>Rim Worlds Applaud Results</h2>\
  The Central Directorate has formally acknowledged the battlefield\
  \ contributions of {12}, an auxiliary unit under the command of {0}, for recent operations \
  carried out under supervision of the Republican Guard.\
  <p>Tasked with containment and eradication of dissident activity, {12} executed assigned objectives \
  with efficiency and minimal deviation from approved parameters. Their actions have - temporarily - demonstrated \
  alignment with the state''s vision for enforced order and external stability.</p>\
  <p>"Operational results are what matter," said a Directorate analyst overseeing asset utilization. "{0}''s\
  \ unit delivered. That is sufficient for now."</p>\
  <p>Sources confirm the unit is under continued observation. Additional deployments may be considered based on \
  performance, obedience, and ideological compatibility.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.TC=<h2>Concordat Commends Discipline</h2>\
  The Office of the Protectorate Defense Command has issued a public\
  \ commendation to {12}, a unit operating under {0}, for their support in securing Concordat \
  territories.\
  <p>Tasked with vital operations and civilian defense across several vulnerable settlements, {12}\
  \ demonstrated discipline, tactical restraint, and a clear respect for Taurian sovereignty.</p>\
  <p>"They came in, did the job right, and didn''t overreach," said Colonel Deric Mahon of the Concordat Defense \
  Force. "They weren''t here to show off - they were here to help. That counts for something."</p>\
  <p>While newer combat units often face scrutiny, {0}''s team has begun to shift perception. There is \
  already talk within the Concordat Assembly of drafting new terms for cooperative defense efforts based on this \
  successful engagement.</p>\
  <p>Here in the Concordat, loyalty is earned - and {12} may be on their way to earning more than just a \
  contract.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MOC=<h2>The Magistrix''s New Heroes</h2>\
  The Magistracy Armed Forces confirmed today that \
  {12}, led by {0}, have completed a series of coordinated operations in Magistracy space with \
  distinction.\
  <p>{12} worked in conjunction with MAF strategic command and civilian security coalitions to neutralize\
  \ multiple hostile threats while maintaining strong support for infrastructure recovery and local governance.</p>\
  <p>Their professionalism and discretion have not gone unnoticed.</p>\
  <p>"We judge a by how they act," said Colonel Lysandra Vo, MAF liaison to the Office of External Defense. \
  "{0}''s team understood the assignment and exceeded expectations."</p>\
  <p>While formal partnerships remain rare, insiders suggest {12} may be approached for future \
  collaborative contracts - particularly those requiring a precise touch.</p>\
  <p>In the Magistracy, reputation isn''t granted - it''s earned. And {12} are building theirs one clean \
  operation at a time.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.OA=<h2>Alliance Acknowledges Support</h2>\
  The Council of Prefectural Security has issued an official \
  commendation to {12}, a command unit under the leadership of {0}, following a series of \
  coordinated defense operations across Alliance territory.\
  <p>Operating under provisional oversight in the outer prefectures, {12} assisted in securing civilian \
  transports and provided non-intrusive support to local militia forces without compromising regional autonomy - an \
  achievement that has earned them quiet respect among senior Council members.</p>\
  <p>"They did the work. They didn''t overstep. They listened," said Prefect Ilana Wys, commander of the Alliance \
  Border Militia. "That''s rare."</p>\
  <p>Though the Outworlds Alliance historically favors internal defense and limited military presence, \
  {0}''s approach - calm, efficient, and unobtrusive - has sparked new conversations around selective \
  deployments of trusted units.</p>\
  <p>In a region where peace is hard-won and sovereignty is non-negotiable, {12} have proven that military \
  help doesn''t have to come at the cost of control.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MH=<h2>Marian Praise for {12}</h2>\
  Imperial Command has confirmed that {12}, a military \
  unit under the leadership of {0}, have earned formal praise from the Legio Marianes following a \
  victorious campaign on the Hegemony frontier.\
  <p>Engaged in operations to enforce Hegemony rule in contested territories, {12} were granted limited \
  command authority by regional Legates - and delivered results with speed, discipline, and power.</p>\
  <p>Sources within the Caesar''s court indicate that the unit''s performance was reviewed personally, with \
  commendations issued under the imperial seal.</p>\
  <p>"They acted without hesitation. They achieved results without excuses," said Tribune Flavian Rax, senior aide to\
  \ the Caesar. "Such conduct reflects the values of the Legio."</p>\
  <p>{0}''s name is now spoken with respect in both Senate halls and military camps. Rumors of further \
  operations - or possible honorary titles - are already circulating.</p>\
  <p>In the Marian Hegemony, strength is currency - and {12} are proving rich in it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.TD=<h2>{12} Linked to Pirates</h2>\
  Once considered a disciplined command, {12}, led by \
  the enigmatic {0}, are now raising alarms across multiple sectors following their recent involvement with\
  \ the Tortuga Dominions - a known haven for pirates, warlords, and renegade factions.\
  <p>Sources confirm {12} accepted a direct contract from Tortugan leaders earlier this cycle, reportedly \
  conducting "containment" operations that resulted in the razing of several settlements, seizure of trade convoys, \
  and the elimination of suspected resistance cells. Eyewitnesses describe precision strikes backed by overwhelming \
  force - with little concern for collateral damage.</p>\
  <p>"Whatever they once were, they''re pirates now," said an anonymous source from the local resistance. "And they''re\
  \ getting paid to act like it."</p>\
  <p>Despite their clean operational record in previous engagements, their alignment with Tortuga''s anarchic \
  leadership has cast doubt on the long-term intentions of {12}. Political analysts warn this could \
  represent a shift in the market - where results trump ethics and loyalty bends toward whoever pays most.</p>\
  <p>A growing number of border systems are now flagging {12} as a "high-risk unaffiliated combat \
  element," with some planetary militias placing them on active watchlists.</p>\
  <p>As always in the Periphery, today''s hired gun can become tomorrow''s warlord. {12} may soon learn \
  that reputation is easier to spend than it is to restore.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.CS=<h2>{12} Quietly Deliver</h2>\
  In a time when chaos edges closer to the heart of every border \
  world, few names stir as much quiet confidence - and growing respect - as {12}, the military unit under the\
  \ command of {0}.\
  <p>Over the past several years, {12} have conducted high-value operations across dozens of conflict \
  zones, often stepping in where others falter. Their deployments are fast. Their outcomes are clean. Their \
  discretion is unmatched.</p>\
  <p>"They don''t posture. They don''t politic. They just solve problems," said one unnamed intelligence analyst \
  familiar with their recent work. "That''s what separates them from the rest."</p>\
  <p>While details of their backers, contracts, and logistics remain closely guarded, evidence of their work can be \
  found in improved trade security across several planets, the collapse of multiple destabilizing warlord coalitions, \
  and precise counterinsurgency support in systems too dangerous for traditional forces.</p>\
  <p>"They''re not mercs," said a source with insight into their operations. "They''re professionals. Someone, somewhere,\
  \ is trusting them with critical tasks - and they''re delivering."</p>\
  <p>With rumors swirling of deeper strategic engagements on the horizon, observers are beginning to wonder:</p>\
  <p>Who is the benefactor hiring {12}?</p>\
  <p>And more importantly - why do they keep winning?</p>\

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.WOB=<h2>Blakist Ties Raise Concerns</h2>\
  Reports are emerging that the military unit known as \
  {12}, commanded by {0}, may have entered into operational alignment with none other than the \
  Word of Blake - the same fanatical sect responsible for the recent atrocities of the Jihad.\
  <p>While official confirmations remain scarce, multiple sources across fringe intelligence networks and planetary \
  security logs have flagged The Stakeholder''s activity in systems long thought to harbor Blakist remnants. Civilian \
  vessels report sightings of the unit escorting unidentified DropShips with masked transponders. Others claim to \
  have intercepted encrypted broadcasts referencing "Guided {12}" and "the Pattern''s Soldiers."</p>\
  <p>If these reports are accurate, they paint a chilling picture: a once-respected command may now be functioning as\
  \ hired guns for religious extremists.</p>\
  <p>Security analysts are warning that this could signal a dangerous new phase in the Word of Blake''s \
  strategy.</p>\
  <p>"This is how it starts," said Janell Asou, former militia captain turned conflict journalist. "You take a \
  disciplined unit, offer them money, doctrine, and mystery - and suddenly they''re not just fighting for contracts \
  anymore. They''re fighting for something far worse."</p>\
  <p>Multiple systems are now pushing for formal investigations, with some already labeling {12} a \
  "Blakist-adjacent force."</p>\
  <p>Whether they''re true believers or just well-paid deniers, the facts are piling up. And the question grows louder\
  \ across the Inner Sphere:</p>\
  <p>Where will {0} strike next - and who will they be preaching for when they do?</p>

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MG=<h2>{12} Make Their Mark: Mid-Tier Outfit Punches Above \
  Its Weight</h2>\
  <p>The ''Meks are still cooling, but one name keeps turning up on debriefs and contractor logs: \
  <b>{12}</b>.</p>\
  <p>The once-quiet mercenary company, previously known for low-profile operations and border skirmish cleanup, has \
  drawn serious attention after a string of decisive operations in contested zones. According to internal logs from \
  the <b>Mercenary''s Guild</b>, {12} executed several successful back-to-back operations with zero \
  contract violations, minimum collateral, and one confirmed enemy commander capture.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"They''re efficient, disciplined, and they don''t ask stupid questions," said Reis Danford, a \
  Mercenary Guild liaison officer based on Solaris VII. "{12} have moved from just another name on a \
  rotation list to one of our preferred-response units for fast-moving conflict zones. That doesn''t happen by \
  accident."</i></p><blockquote>\
  <p>Sources inside the Guild suggest that the unit''s ability to coordinate fire support across mixed lance \
  compositions has caught the attention of several major contracting parties.</p>\
  <p>The Guild has verified that {12} are now appearing in name-specific contract queries<, a clear sign \
  their performance has hit the broader strategic radar. While House representatives have yet to comment, insiders \
  report that several big hitters have "logged interest" in the unit''s movements.</p>\

  not disclosed - has reported {3} {8, choice, 0#have|1#has} maintained strict operational discipline and tight field \
  logistics, a trait rare among mid-tier units operating under variable contracts.</p>\
  <p>With their reputation rising, {12} are either on the cusp of a major payday - or a steep learning \
  curve under heavier eyes.</p>\
  <p>Either way, the Inner Sphere just got another serious player in the sandbox.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MRB=<h2>ComStar Issues Rare Statement on Mercenary Activity: \
  {12} Named in Review</h2>\
  <p>In an unusual public communication, ComStar''s Mercenary Review Board (MRB) released a brief statement this week \
  regarding recent mercenary activity, specifically naming {12} as "a unit under performance review due \
  to consistent contract compliance and tactical efficiency in unstable theaters."</p>\
  <p>While the MRB is known for its silence and bureaucratic neutrality, insiders familiar with the organization say \
  the decision to comment publicly signals a potential shift in how certain independent mercenary companies are being\
  \ tracked, rated, and potentially prioritized for high-value contracts.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"{12} have demonstrated a notable pattern of operational stability, logistical \
  self-sufficiency, and adherence to MRB protocol," the statement read. "Such factors merit ongoing observation and \
  data retention for future deployment optimization."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Translation? Someone powerful is asking about {12} - and ComStar is hedging its bets.</p>\
  <p>{12}, a mid-tier but increasingly visible unit, recently completed several contracts that have drawn\
  \ attention for their clean execution and unusually low civilian collateral rates. Some suspect the Houses are \
  behind the growing interest, though neither House officials nor ComStar representatives would confirm.</p>\
  <p>What makes this development unique is that MRB statements on individual units are exceedingly rare. Most unit \
  evaluations remain behind encrypted channels, released only to employers with clearance and C-Bills. The fact that \
  {12} were named at all suggests a broader political interest at play - possibly even House-level \
  jockeying ahead of regional destabilization.</p>\
  <p>When contacted, {12}'' command team declined to comment. However, an anonymous source within the \
  Mercenary''s Guild noted, "You don''t get this kind of spotlight unless someone''s preparing to pay top dollar - or bury\
  \ you with expectations."</p>\
  <p>The coming weeks may reveal which.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.PRESS_RECOGNITION.MRBC=<h2>MRBC Flags {12} in Performance Index</h2>\
  <p>In a quarterly bulletin that usually goes unnoticed beyond employer circles, the Mercenary Review and Bonding \
  Commission (MRBC) quietly issued a status update that has sparked buzz in the mercenary circuit: {12} \
  have been formally listed in the MRBC''s Tier III Performance Index.</p>\
  <p>The designation is reserved for units that, while not large enough to qualify for strategic-level deployments, \
  have shown high reliability, tactical cohesion, and adaptability across multiple theaters of operation. It''s the \
  kind of flag that gets mercs noticed - not just by employers, but by rivals and recruiters alike.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We monitor hundreds of bonded units annually," said MRBC Outreach Coordinator Major Loras Grahn.\
  \ "{12} have shown above-average discipline, logistical independence, and mission success rates across \
  both urban and mixed-terrain engagements. That level of operational maturity is what earns a place on our \
  watchlist."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>While the MRBC typically avoids overt praise or favoritism, veteran analysts point out that being named in an \
  MRBC bulletin - especially out of the Dragoons'' Outreach headquarters - is a clear signal to high-tier employers \
  that the unit is "safe money."</p>\
  <p>The MRBC''s attention comes at a time when contract opportunities in the Free Worlds League and Capellan border \
  zones are heating up. Several Houses are rumored to be engaging in quiet talent acquisition ahead of regional \
  escalations.</p>\
  <p>No official comment has been issued from {12} command, but recent traffic shows a marked increase in \
  name-specific contract queries tied to the unit. Whether that leads to a prestige deployment - or just bigger targets\
  \ on their back - remains to be seen.</p>\
  <p>With the MRBC''s stamp on their dossier, {12} may have just stepped out of the gray and into the \
  spotlight.</p>

  <p>It is with that in mind that we extend a formal invitation: Join us - not as outsiders on contract, but as full \
  participants in the shared security and prosperity of the League.</p>\

## Messages
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.innerSphere=<h2>{12} Land on {11} in Service to {10}</h2>\
  <p>In a striking display of force and coordination, {12} have deployed across strategic sectors of \
  {11}, operating under the authority of {10}. Their landing was swift, professional, and unmistakably \
  calculated.</p>\
  <p>Local reactions have ranged from cautious support to tense uncertainty, with residents witnessing the arrival of\
  \ 'Mek columns, logistical units, and reconnaissance flights sweeping overhead within hours of touchdown.</p>\
  <p>"Their orders come from {10}, and so far, they're sticking to them," said one planetary official, requesting \
  anonymity. "They aren't here to make friends. They're here to get results."</p>\
  <p>For {10}, {12} represent a powerful extension of will - capable of pacifying contested zones, securing \
  vital infrastructure, or simply making a statement. Whether welcomed or not, their message is clear: {10} has \
  influence here, and it now wears steel.</p>\
  <p>As patrols expand and command centers activate, the people of {11} watch closely. For some, it's a \
  sign of stability. For others, a shift in control. Either way, the boots are on the ground - and they march under the\
  \ banner of {10}.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.CC=<h2>Confederation Order Rises: {12} Secure {11}</h2>\
  <p>Under the firm direction of a Chancellor-approved command, the highly decorated military formation known as \
  <i{12}</i> recently established an operational presence on {11}. In coordinated precision, \
  {0} and their company landed at dawn and immediately secured all key infrastructure nodes, ensuring swift\
  \ compliance with State protocols.</p>\
  <p>Where citizens welcomed their arrival with disciplined celebration, processions and banners filled the streets. \
  Where resistance lingered, it was met with swift, proportional enforcement to restore harmony. Ministry officials \
  affirmed that all actions were undertaken in accordance with the Confederation's Directive for Regional Stability \
  and Cultural Integration.</p>\
  <p>"{11} has long suffered from ideological disarray," said Administrator Tuan Zhao, senior liaison for \
  Political Reeducation. "The arrival of {12} marks a new chapter  -  one aligned with clarity, unity, and \
  future stability."</p>\
  <p>{0}, speaking before the Central Governance Hub, assured the population that operations would be \
  handled with efficiency and purpose. "Our mission," they declared, "is the restoration of order under the guiding \
  light of the Confederation. All who value structure and dignity will find their place here."</p>\
  <p>Broadcasts of {12}' precise military drills and community stabilization efforts will continue \
  nightly, reinforcing the message: the Capellan Confederation is here  -  not to oppress, but to uplift. \
  {11} now moves forward, one disciplined step at a time.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.DC=<h2>The Dragon's Will Enforced: {12} Land on {11}</h2>\
  <p>The disciplined boots of {12} recently tread upon {11}, acting with the full sanction of \
  the Coordinator's long-view strategy. Their descent was silent, their formation precise  -  a demonstration of the \
  strength and order that defines the Draconis Combine.</p>\
  <p>Civilian presence was contained respectfully as {12} secured all critical sectors within the first \
  hour. Local officials - those wise enough to yield - have been retained under provisional review. Streets once \
  uncertain now echo with the footsteps of warriors who understand the meaning of duty.</p>\
  <p>"{11} is not lost," said Tai-sa Yukio Tanaka, regional overseer. "It is being reclaimed  -  from \
  weakness, from confusion, and from dishonor."</p>\
  <p>{0} of {12} addressed the populace with customary restraint. "We have come to serve the \
  Dragon's will," {1} stated. "Those who uphold order shall know peace. Those who resist will be corrected."</p>\
  <p>Martial demonstrations will continue this week in the central plaza. All citizens are encouraged to observe and \
  reflect on the values of obedience, tradition, and strength that the Combine brings. In the shadow of the Dragon, \
  {11} begins anew  -  with honor, under watchful eyes.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.LA=<h2>{12} Touch Down on {11}: Efficiency \
  Meets Authority</h2>\
  <p>{12} arrived on {11} with precision drops, flawless coordination, and the full logistical \
  might expected of an Inner Sphere powerhouse. Their landing signaled a turning point for the planet  -  whether as \
  honored reinforcements or as decisive peacekeepers.</p>\
  <p>Witnesses described orderly deployments, economic infrastructure assessments, and rapid security perimeter \
  establishment, all within hours of landfall. Markets reopened under the watch of {0}, and local transit \
  was rerouted efficiently with minimal civilian disruption.</p>\
  <p>"{11} needed a stabilizing hand," said Hauptmann-General Elsa Rathburn of the Lyran Armed Forces. "Now\
  \ it has one  -  backed by steel, systems, and sound governance."</p>\
  <p>{0} of {12} issued a brief but clear statement. "This planet will benefit from structure. \
  Our arrival brings not just peace  -  but prosperity and capability."</p>\
  <p>Planetary defense units have been integrated into the arriving command's logistics framework. Civilian services \
  are being evaluated for modernization. In the Lyran view, stability is not just an ideal  -  it's an outcome. And \
  today, {11} is one step closer to achieving it.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.FS=<h2>{12} Arrive: Order Restored on {11}</h2>\
  <p>Under the banner of duty and stability, {12} have made landfall on {11}. Columns of \
  BattleMeks moved with disciplined precision, securing key zones while broadcasting messages of protection and civic\
  \ reassurance.</p>\
  <p>For many citizens, the sight was a welcome one. "They didn't come to conquer  -  they came to defend what's right," \
  said local resident Linna Hartwell, watching a patrol pass her street. "This feels like hope in armor."</p>\
  <p>Others viewed the deployment with measured caution, but even those with questions noted the absence of disorder.\
  \ {12} operate with the clear structure and resolve emblematic of Federated Suns doctrine  -  protect the\
  \ people first, secure peace second, and ask for nothing but purpose in return.</p>\
  <p>{0}'s official transmission was brief: "{11} deserves better than chaos. We will ensure it \
  never sees that again."</p>\
  <p>With supply chains re-established and security corridors enforced, {11} begins a new chapter  -  watched\
  \ over by professionals, not plunderers. Whatever conflict preceded this moment, the future is now being written in\
  \ calm lines and armored resolve.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.FWL=<h2>{11} Welcomes New Chapter Under New Oversight</h2>\
  <p>The arrival of {12} this morning has drawn strong attention across the planetary provinces and \
  within regional command circles. Whether viewed as stabilizers or strategic intercessors, their presence is already\
  \ reshaping the civic and logistical landscape.</p>\
  <p>Operating under a provisional mandate, {12} deployed with high coordination and minimal disruption. \
  Key infrastructure was secured within hours, and interim governance protocols are now in effect. Civil traffic \
  remains open, and broadcast systems report uninterrupted access to public utilities and news feeds.</p>\
  <p>"This is what shared responsibility looks like," noted Delegate Ramon Jaali of the Western Quadrant Assembly. \
  "Whether this is a partnership or a proving ground remains to be seen  -  but it is not chaos, and that matters."</p>\
  <p>Allied Command has issued no formal edict beyond affirming their intent to maintain order and protect local \
  interests. A statement issued via open comms simply read: "{11} stands at a crossroad. We are here to \
  keep the road open."</p>\
  <p>Within the framework of League ideals, such presence is not foreign  -  it's federative. And while opinions differ\
  \ across districts, all parties agree on one point: for better or worse, {11} is no longer isolated  -  and\
  \ not alone.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.TH=<h2>{11} Receives {12} with Ceremony and Precision</h2>\
  <p>Under clear skies and orderly procession, {12} made landfall today, beginning what many are calling \
  a "necessary rebalancing" of {11}'s fractured geopolitical condition. Terran Hegemony observers present \
  on-site described the deployment as "flawless, efficient, and worthy of the legacy it now extends."</p>\
  <p>Crowds gathered in major city centers  -  some in curiosity, others in welcome  -  as the lead elements of \
  {12} moved into position with practiced exactitude. While opinions may vary on the planet's prior \
  trajectory, most acknowledge that an age of uncertainty has now given way to something more focused.</p>\
  <p>"{11} has the potential to become something greater," said Prefect Ilona Chai, speaking from the \
  orbital coordination hub. "This arrival marks the beginning of that ascent."</p>\
  <p>Allied Command issued a single communiqu upon touchdown: "This planet deserves structure. We offer it."</p>\
  <p>For a system long defined by fragmentation, today marks the first step toward integration  -  not by force, but by\
  \ function. The Terran Hegemony watches closely, confident that, under the right guidance, {11} may yet \
  become a world worthy of its position among the stars.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.ROS=<h2>{12} Arrive on {11} to Applause \
  and Anticipation</h2>\
  <p>In a moment of renewed hope and reinforced security, {12} touched down today on {11}. As \
  their DropShips settled with clockwork precision, citizens watched with cautious optimism  -  and in many quarters, \
  open applause.</p>\
  <p>Their arrival marks a pivotal step in {11}'s journey toward lasting stability. Republic spokespeople \
  called it "a timely intervention" in support of broader peace initiatives across the sector. Local leaders were \
  quick to echo the sentiment, hailing {12} as "disciplined professionals, arriving not just to hold \
  ground  -  but to hold hope."</p>\
  <p>Reports from key urban centers describe an atmosphere of watchfulness mixed with relief. For some, the presence \
  of organized power offers the first sense of security in recent memory. For others, it is a reminder that actions \
  now have consequence  -  and protection is not without responsibility.</p>\
  <p>"We do not fear change," said Mayor Falen Rios of Pindar City. "We welcome structure. We welcome purpose."</p>\
  <p>Where {11} was once a question mark, the Republic now sees the beginnings of an answer  -  forged in \
  steel, shaped by resolve, and carried forward by those who still believe in unity over chaos.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.SL=<h2>{12} Bring Star League Order to {11}</h2>\
  <p>As the unmistakable silhouette of League-aligned DropShips broke through the upper atmosphere today, one truth \
  became clear: {11} is no longer adrift. {12} have arrived  -  and with them, the stabilizing \
  force of Star League intent.</p>\
  <p>Whether greeted with cheers or with wary silence, their arrival marks a historical correction. Citizens across \
  population centers watched from balconies and thoroughfares as precision formations deployed with signature \
  efficiency. What once was contested is now clarified.</p>\
  <p>"Civilization is not a suggestion," read a prepared statement from League observers in orbit. "It is a structure. \
  One that requires will to build and courage to protect. {11} now stands beneath that structure."</p>\
  <p>{12} are expected to begin immediate assessment of local infrastructure and security readiness. \
  Regional representatives have already been briefed on integration protocols and civic normalization measures.</p>\
  <p>From the Core to the frontier, the Star League continues to chart the future. Today, {11} joins the \
  map  -  not as an afterthought but as part of something enduring. The Age of War ends one world at a time.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.FC=<h2>Federated Commonwealth Celebrates Arrival of {12} on {11}</h2>\
  <p>The arrival of {12} has drawn the gaze of the Federated Commonwealth, where citizens and military \
  alike see the landing as a mark of forward progress  -  and a firm stand against instability, wherever it hides.</p>\
  <p>Though reactions on {11} vary from warm welcome to stiff resistance, the message from High Command \
  remains consistent: unity through strength, prosperity through responsibility. {12} embody that \
  principle, bringing with them seasoned discipline and battlefield efficiency long recognized in Commonwealth \
  circles.</p>\
  <p>"You don't get to choose when history comes knocking," said Marshal Devin Voss during a brief statement from New\
  \ Avalon. "But you do get to choose what side you're on when it does."</p>\
  <p>Commonwealth officials have indicated that stabilization teams are prepared to coordinate with planetary \
  authorities or neutralize threats as needed. The goal, they stress, is restoration  -  not occupation. But make no \
  mistake: hesitation will not be rewarded.</p>\
  <p>{11} now stands at a turning point. With {12} on the ground and the banner of the \
  Federated Commonwealth behind them, the planet is no longer an isolated variable. It's part of a greater equation  - \
  \ one that ends in strength, order, and a future that works.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.periphery=<h2>{10} Welcomes {12} Amid Uncertain Support</h2>\
  <p>In an announcement early this morning, {10} confirmed that {12} have begun deploying under a \
  temporary mandate to secure vital installations and stabilize disputed regions. Whether their presence brings \
  relief or reveals a shift in power, one thing is clear: {10} has called them in - and they've arrived.</p>\
  <p>'Mek units from {12} now stand guard at water treatment plants, transit hubs, and local government \
  buildings. Some neighborhoods greeted them with calm curiosity. Others boarded windows and watched in silence.</p>\
  <p>"We requested their assistance," said Councilor Yara Sellin of {10}. "Our infrastructure was at risk. Their \
  mission is to protect, but we will remain watchful."</p>\
  <p>{12} maintain a low profile, coordinating with local officials on patrol schedules and security \
  protocols. Their vehicles bear both their emblem and the seal of {10} - a dual reminder of who's paying and who's \
  watching.</p>\
  <p>For the residents of {11}, the arrival signifies a new dynamic: stability under steel, delivered from \
  beyond - but under local authority. Whether partnership or pressure, the line between them is thin - and it will be \
  tested in the days ahead.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.RWR=<h2>Rim Worlds Republic Demonstrates Power as The \
  {12} Land on {11}</h2>\
  <p>Citizens were ordered to observe from designated locations as {12} touched down under full escort \
  from Rim Worlds Republic forces. The arrival was not a negotiation. It was a declaration.</p>\
  <p>Columns of precision-marched infantry, armored support units, and coordinated flyovers signaled the message \
  clearly: {11} is under observation, and the Republic is watching. Loudspeakers across urban centers \
  broadcast the voice of the Directorate: "Stability is not a request. Compliance is not optional."</p>\
  <p>Whether locals responded with silent obedience or strained defiance, the Republic made its point  -  and made it \
  loudly. {12} bring with them not only firepower, but the weight of the Directorate's will. They do not \
  land lightly. They do not leave quietly.</p>\
  <p>"This is a demonstration of alignment," said Director-General Korvach in a rare public address. "{11} \
  now has the opportunity  -  and the obligation  -  to contribute to the greater machinery of order. Resistance will not\
  \ be tolerated. Harmony will be enforced."</p>\
  <p>The message is clear: The Rim Worlds Republic does not negotiate with chaos. It eliminates it. {12} \
  are here to see that principle upheld.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.TC=<h2>{12} Land on {11} to Applause - and Warnings</h2>\
  <p>As the thunder of DropShips roared overhead, the citizens of {11} gathered - some with cautious \
  optimism, others with wary silence - as {12} touched down. Their arrival, backed by the authority of the \
  Taurian Concordat, marks a decisive moment for a world long balanced on the edge of control and autonomy.</p>\
  <p>"We don't send soldiers to parade," said a spokesperson from the Protectorate Guard. "We send them to stand up \
  for the people who do the work, who hold the line, and who've been ignored for too long."</p>\
  <p>{12} were met with firm handshakes in towns where the Concordat is respected - and met with hard \
  stares in districts less aligned. Regardless of sentiment, the message was the same: The Bull does not abandon its \
  own, and it does not blink in the face of threats, foreign or domestic.</p>\
  <p>Local militiamen stood shoulder to shoulder with Taurian troops, not as subordinates, but as peers. While no \
  incidents were reported, official broadcasts made clear: "{11} is under Taurian protection now. Any act \
  against {12} will be considered an act against the Concordat."</p>\
  <p>This is not an occupation. It's a warning - and a promise. {11} may be on the edge of the map, but it's \
  not beyond the Bull's reach.</p>

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.OA=<h2>{12} Arrive on {11} Amid Quiet Reception and Measured Welcome</h2>\
  <p>The skies opened this morning as {12} descended in a controlled and disciplined landing, their 'Meks \
  touching down with minimal disruption. While their reputation precedes them, the people of {11} responded\
  \ not with fanfare, but with the quiet strength characteristic of the Alliance: open eyes, level heads, and \
  tempered curiosity.</p>\
  <p>Council Speaker Merian Toth issued a public address shortly after arrival: "We do not judge by fear, nor welcome\
  \ blindly. But we recognize that some forces arrive not to dominate, but to assist. Our responsibility is to see \
  clearly."</p>\
  <p>{12} made no immediate military movements and instead held brief consultations with local civil \
  leaders. Children watched the towering machines from rooftops, while elders offered calm guidance to younger voices\
  \ urging caution.</p>\
  <p>Some districts have requested closer cooperation with the newcomers, citing defense concerns and the need for \
  better coordination along disputed borders. Others have chosen to observe and wait. Both responses, according to \
  Alliance principles, are valid.</p>\
  <p>Whether {12} are friends or just passing through, one thing is clear: {11} will decide on \
  its own terms. As always.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.MH=<h2>Arrival of {12} Heralds Imperial Might on {11}</h2>\
  <p>With the thunder of steel and the banners of honor aloft, {12} made their triumphant descent onto \
  {11} this morning, greeted by disciplined legions and the echoing salutes of planetary garrisons.</p>\
  <p>As Imperial horns sounded across the city centers, Praetorian spokesmen proclaimed, "Where the Eagle flies, \
  order follows. Where {12} tread, so too does the will of Caesar." The citizens  -  whether loyal subjects\
  \ or recent acquisitions  -  lined the thoroughfares in orderly formation, as dictated by the civic decree of High \
  Command.</p>\
  <p>{12}, armored and glorious, marched in lockstep through the Forum of {11} under the \
  watchful eyes of Centurions. Their presence, a symbol of the Hegemony's expanding influence, serves both as \
  celebration and as stern reminder: Rome rewards loyalty, but never tolerates defiance.</p>\
  <p>Local governors, advised to align with Hegemonic interests, issued statements praising the arrival as "a \
  consolidation of strength and unity." Strategic infrastructure zones have been designated for use by \
  {12}, and compliance from civil authorities has been reported as "satisfactory."</p>\
  <p>The crowd cheered under guard supervision as a company of Imperial 'Meks executed precision drills in the Grand \
  Plaza. Across the planet, the message was unmistakable: strength is not an option  -  it is law.</p>\
  <p>Thus begins the next chapter in {11}'s destiny  -  under Rome's shadow, or beneath its heel.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.CS=<h2>Emergent Stability: {12}' Arrival on {11}</h2>\
  <p>In a galaxy increasingly fractured by unchecked ambition and ideological extremism, the unexpected arrival of \
  {12} on {11} has stirred both curiosity and cautious optimism.</p>\
  <p>Operating with remarkable precision and a calm demeanor absent from most paramilitary operations, {12} \
  touched down without incident and immediately established contact with local leadership. Observers noted their \
  clean logistics, structured negotiation, and focus on securing essential infrastructure - not for conquest, but for \
  stabilization.</p>\
  <p>Their arrival was not heralded with pomp, nor did it require violent demonstration. Instead, {12} \
  moved with intent: a presence built upon results, not declarations. Their 'Mek-lances, while formidable, remained at\
  \ parade rest. Their envoys spoke softly, often invoking the language of mutual benefit, resource equity, and \
  interstellar continuity.</p>\
  <p>While planetary authorities have yet to issue an official position, the impact is tangible. Checkpoints run \
  smoothly. Trade convoys move with security. Power flows to outlying districts long neglected. For some, this is \
  order restored. For others, it is a signal - a new actor, unbound by tradition, capable of reshaping the field \
  without shouting.</p>\
  <p>One must ask: what defines legitimacy in an age where empires collapse and thrones crumble? Perhaps it is not \
  lineage, but results. Not declarations, but delivery.</p>\
  <p>{12} offer no creed. But their presence may yet serve a higher balance.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.TRIUMPH_OR_REMEMBRANCE.WOB=<h2>Dark Allies: {11} Questions {12}' True Allegiances</h2>\
  <p>As {12} establish a presence on {11}, what began as a cautious reception has soured into \
  quiet alarm. New intelligence points to troubling affiliations with the Word of Blake  -  the same fanatics \
  responsible for mass atrocities that have engulfed dozens of worlds in terror.</p>\
  <p>While {12} maintain a neutral front, their logistical networks, encrypted communications, and recent\
  \ deployments appear to overlap with known Blakist patterns. Several independent analysts have flagged their sudden\
  \ arrival on {11} as "strategically aligned" with Word of Blake expansion goals in the region.</p>\
  <p>Residents have reported witnessing The Stakeholder deploy operatives conducting late-night meetings with \
  unidentified parties. Civilian infrastructure is being "reorganized" under the guise of efficiency. Religious \
  iconography linked to the Word's fringe sects has allegedly been found in confiscated personal effects  -  reports \
  that local command have refused to confirm or deny.</p>\
  <p>Critics argue {12} represent a new kind of threat: not overt invaders, but ideological infiltrators \
   -  disciplined, charismatic, and armed with the Blakists' doctrine of righteous destruction.</p>\
  <p>As {11} enters what officials call a "monitoring phase," the question remains  -  are {12} \
  truly independent? Or are they a blade carried by the Word's invisible hand?</p>\
  <p><b>Citizens are advised to report unusual activity, avoid contact with Stakeholder personnel, and remain alert \

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.innerSphere=<h2>Statue of {0} Dedicated</h2>\
  On a clear morning in {11}'s central square, local {10} leaders unveiled a modest yet dignified statue \
  honoring <b>{0}</b>, whose actions in recent field operations were credited with protecting the nation's \
  fragile governance and civilian lives.\
  <p>The sculpture is crafted from regional stone and depicts the {9} standing with one hand extended in \
  gesture of assurance, the other gripping a neurohelmet - no weapons drawn, but posture strong. At the base, a simple \
  inscription reads:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Protector of our People, Guardian of Peace."</b></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Mayor Serin Vale spoke at the dedication:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"{0} came to our aid when we needed it most - not to conquer, but to stand with us. This \
  statue reminds future generations that courage comes in service, not domination."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The ceremony included soft music from the local string ensemble, followed by the placement of fresh flowers by \
  community volunteers - farmers, council members, and a few uniformed militia. No formal military parade was present, \
  yet the balance of gratitude and dignity was unmistakable.</p>\
  <p>Councilor Duren Arik added:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We are not a great power. We do not build grand monuments. But we honor those who honor us. \
  Today, we do so with sincerity."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>City records officially mark this as a moment of unity - an acknowledgment of how one {9}'s actions helped \
  maintain the stability of a small world in uncertain times.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.CC=<h2>Capellan Statue Dedication Ceremony Marks Glorious Recognition on {11}</h2>\
  Today, under the auspices of the Chancellor's Office and with full sanction of the Ministry of Cultural Integrity, \
  a statue honoring <b>{0}</b> was unveiled in Unity Square on {11}. The monument stands as a \
  powerful testament to the {9}'s unshakable loyalty and exemplary service in recent campaigns conducted under the \
  banner of the Capellan Confederation.\
  <p>The statue, rendered in reinforced obsidian and veined jade, depicts {0} standing at parade rest, their \
  gaze fixed firmly toward the east - symbolizing vigilance against future threats. The figure's posture, subtly \
  reminiscent of Minister Daoshen's own in the Unity Memorial, signifies continuity of purpose and alignment with \
  the Mandate of the State.</p>\
  <p>Attendees included members of the Strategic War College, Party leadership delegates, and honored representatives\
  \ of the Ministry of War. In his keynote address, Prefect-General Shu Li declared:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"To be immortalized in stone on {11} is not a reward. It is a responsibility. \
  {0}'s name now stands among the eternal. Let none forget: in service to the Confederation, greatness is \
  not claimed - it is proven."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The ceremony concluded with a performance by the Jade Harmony Orchestra and a three-minute silence observed \
  across planetary broadcast networks, signifying the unity of all Capellan citizens in shared reverence.</p>\
  <p>The statue will remain under the ceremonial guard of the Maskirovka's Honor Division for the first 90 days - a \
  rare mark of prestige indicating the cultural gravity of the act. Citizens are encouraged to visit and reflect on \
  the shared values of honor, stability, and sacrifice that {0} now embodies in stone.</p>

  to the Dragon</h2>\
  This morning, under the auspices of the Coordinator and with formal sanction from the Order of the Five Pillars, a \
  statue commemorating <b>{0}</b> was unveiled at the Temple Grounds of Resolve on {11}.\
  <p>Forged from blackened steel and inscribed with passages from the <i>Sayings of the Dragon</i>, the statue \
  captures {0} mid-stride, katana sheathed and helm under one arm - a depiction of clarity through strength, \
  and restraint tempered by duty. The base bears no nameplate; in the Combine, true recognition needs no \
  introduction.</p>\
  <p>The Coordinator's representative Shingen Watanabe addressed the assembled crowd of military personnel, nobles, \
  and civilians:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"In the Draconis Combine, honor is earned through blood and discipline. {0} has \
  exemplified these values beyond question. This monument is not a celebration - it is a warning to our enemies, and a \
  lesson to our descendants."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Witnesses to the event report a formalized silence held for thirteen minutes - the traditional span of remembrance\
  \ for those elevated in life for acts worthy of ancestral memory. Monks from the Order of Bushido presented folded \
  silk offerings at the statue's base, and the planetary garrison observed a synchronized kneel in unison.</p>\
  <p>The statue will serve as a permanent reminder that the will of the Dragon cannot be resisted, and those who \
  serve it with distinction may earn their place among the legends - while they still draw breath.</p>

FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.OA=<h2>{0} Memorial Unveiled in {11}: A Tribute to \
  Service Without Spectacle</h2>\
  Without fanfare, but not without meaning, the people of the Outworlds Alliance today unveiled a statue \
  commemorating <b>{0}</b>, whose conduct during recent operations has come to symbolize the principles the\
  \ Alliance holds most dear: restraint, responsibility, and solidarity in defense.\
  <p>The statue - unpainted stone, locally sourced - shows {0} standing with neurohelmet tucked under one \
  arm, eyes forward. There is no weapon drawn, no battle pose struck. Instead, the figure is still, alert, and \
  human.</p>\
  <p>The monument sits in the shaded center of Quiet Sun Plaza, surrounded by community gardens and soft gravel paths. \
  There was no parade. No military procession. Only families, elders, and a few quiet words from Governor Aleron:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"{0} understands what most forget - that force is only noble when guided by conscience. \
  This statue doesn't glorify war. It honors restraint in the face of it."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The unveiling was followed by a moment of silence and the planting of four peacewillow trees - one at each \
  corner of the statue's base. Local schoolchildren placed small hand-written notes of gratitude at the feet of the\
  stone figure. No one was instructed to do so. They simply did.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.MH=<h2>Statue of {0} Unveiled on {11}</h2>\
  In a ceremony marked by martial pageantry and imperial solemnity, a towering marble likeness of <b>{0}</b> \
  was unveiled today before the full Senate, the gathered Legions, and throngs of citizens chanting {7} name in \
  unison.\
  <p>The statue, standing over ten meters high, depicts the {9} in a ceremonial coolant suit, one gladius raised \
  toward the heavens, the other arm outstretched as if leading the charge. At {7} feet lies a shattered enemy banner,\
  \ carved with exquisite detail - a symbol of conquest, command, and righteous dominance.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Strength commands history. {1} commands strength."</b> - Legate Varrus, Fourth Cohort, speaking \
  at the unveiling</p></blockquote>\
  <p>The sculpture occupies the central pedestal of the <b>Field of Triumph</b>, flanked by the bronze busts of prior\
  \ Warlords and Loyal Protectors. The Imperator themselves gave the order for the statue's commission, declaring \
  {0} a <i>Defender of the Realm</i> and granting full honors under the Lex Gloria.</p>\
  <p>Trumpets blared. War banners flew. Veterans wept. Youths pledged allegiance at the foot of the statue, raising \
  their fists in salute to {0}'s legacy.</p>\
  <p>The final words of the Imperator echoed across the plaza:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"Let this effigy endure, carved in eternal stone, to remind all who pass - power is earned \
  through blood, discipline, and obedience. {0} has bled. {2} {8, choice, 0#have|1#has} commanded. And {3} \
  {8, choice, 0#have|1#has} obeyed. Ave Imperator. Ave {0}."</i></p></blockquote>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.CS={9}, there will be no monument. No inscription. No ceremony under \
  stars.</p>\
  <p>Your actions have been observed. Measured. And judged aligned.</p>\
  <p>By directive of the First Circuit, your name and service have been encoded into the Quantum Lattice beneath \
  Hilton Head - a recognition not of rank or title, but of resonance.</p>\
  <p>This is not legacy as others know it. It is preservation through silence. Permanence through obscurity. You will\
  \ not be remembered in stone - but in the Pattern, where all true purpose endures.</p>\
  <p>Walk carefully. You are not alone. And you are no longer unseen.</p>\
  <p>Praise Blake.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.WOB=To {9}, {9} of {12}\
  <p>Your actions have spoken louder than oaths. Your hand has guided fire, and your voice has carried purpose. You \
  have not served the Word. You have <i>manifested</i> it.</p>\
  <p>By decree of the True Circle, and in accordance with Protocol Revelation-17, you are hereby granted the \
  <b>Mandate of Revelation</b>.</p>\
  <p>This is not a title. It is an awakening.</p>\
  <p>From this moment forward, you are authorized to speak doctrine in field engagements, and access sealed fragments\
  \ of the Inner Archive. Your orders carry the weight of conviction. Your actions, the burden of divine reflection.</p>\
  <p>Do not seek glory. Do not seek thanks. Seek only the Pattern.</p>\
  <p><i>The Jihad is not war. It is correction. And now you, Chosen, are its voice.</i></p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.STATUE_OR_SIBKO.clan={9}, your deeds have reshaped expectations. Your victories have \
  brought glory not just to your unit, but to the Clan entire. You have walked the warrior's path with purpose, \
  strength, and honor.\
  <p>Accordingly, the Council has reached consensus: a Sibko shall be raised from your gene-template.</p>\
  <p>This is not tribute. It is legacy.</p>\
  <p>Your genetic material has been archived. Within the Iron Wombs, a new generation will rise - bred from your \
  bloodline, forged in your image, and instructed under the same unforgiving principles you have proven worthy of.</p>\
  <p>One day, one among them may stand where you now do... or against you. Such is the way.</p>\
  <p>Honor this trust. Live accordingly. Your life now echoes across generations.</p>

  <p>By your hand, {10} stands taller. Through every mission - each high-risk deployment, every calculated strike - you've\
  \ upheld not just our security, but our very ideals: courage under fire, compassion with strength, and measured \
  judgment in chaos.</p>\
  <p>Tonight, I write to you not as a distant official, but as one fellow citizen who slept easier knowing you \
  watched over our skies. Your leadership has become woven into our national narrative - no speech, no monument, \
  compares to the living proof of your resolve.</p>\
  <p>In quiet hours, when systems hum and monitors blink, know this: you've earned our unwavering trust, and you \
  carry {10}'s gratitude with every step forward.</p>\
  <p>Stand firm. Stand bright.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.CC={0},\
  <p>Across the Capellan Confederation, names are spoken with caution. Yours is spoken with certainty. When our \
  agents whisper of victory, they mean you. When our generals ask who holds the line, your record answers for you. No\
  \ file, no transcript, no honor roll contains your full measure - because your loyalty is too precise, your intent \
  too absolute.</p>\
  <p>You have become what all servants of the state aspire to be: <i>indistinguishable from the will of the \
  Confederation itself.</i></p>\
  <p>I have watched your decisions ripple from distant provinces to the inner courts. You do not seek permission to \
  serve. You simply serve - and in doing so, bend fate toward unity, not chaos.</p>\
  <p>This message is not a reward. It is acknowledgment. You have carried the burden of expectation and transformed \
  it into an undeniable consequence. History will record your acts in the same breath as those who reshaped the \
  Capellan destiny.</p>\
  <p>Know that you are seen. Deeply. And with absolute trust.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.DC=To {0},\
  <p>There are moments in a Coordinator's life when a single warrior's path echoes so clearly with the virtues of the\
  \ Dragon, it must be recognized  -  not with praise, but with solemn clarity.</p>\
  <p>You have become such a figure.</p>\
  <p>Not by requesting honor. Not by grasping for influence. But by acting  -  with control, with precision, with a \
  silence that speaks louder than glory. Where others waver, you are unmoved. Where others seek recognition, you \
  offer outcome.</p>\
  <p>The Order of the Five Pillars has reviewed your record. The Combine's legions recount your name in war briefings. \
  And our ancestral historians have prepared a scroll of deeds that now enters the vaults beneath the Temple of the \
  Sword.</p>\
  <p>This message is not ceremonial. It is sacred.</p>\
  <p>Understand: others can no longer judge you. You are judged by your own reflection in the eyes of those who will \
  follow your example.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>Steel does not boast loud<br>\
  But the cut remembers all.<br>\
  Honor walks in ash.</p></i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Walk with gravity, {9}. The Dragon does not forget its own.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.LA=To {0},\
  <p>Some victories are tactical. Some are strategic. A rare few become structural  -  they shift not just the balance \
  of power, but the expectation of what leadership looks like.</p>\
  <p>You are the latter.</p>\
  <p>Your name circulates not just in reports but in boardrooms. You are a case study. An anomaly. A success we \
  cannot dismiss or replicate. Your methods have drawn admiration from admirals and economists alike. Your units \
  perform with precision, initiative, and momentum  -  the same principles that drive Lyran commerce, infrastructure, \
  and command.</p>\
  <p>This message is not for commendation. It is for recognition. You are now part of the machinery that drives this \
  state forward. Not a cog. Not a spoke. A governor  -  a regulating force through which influence flows.</p>\
  <p>Tharkad recognizes your command. The Commonwealth stands strengthened in your shadow. And I, personally, \
  acknowledge the magnitude of your service.</p>\
  <p>From this day forward, when your name is spoken within this House, it is spoken with strategic weight.</p>\
  <p>Keep moving forward, {9}. The future, like any market, rewards only those who never stall.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FS={0},\
  <p>When we speak of heroes in the Federated Suns, we speak not of rank or medals. We speak of those who stand when \
  others fall. Who take the harder path. Who lead not with authority, but with example.</p>\
  <p>Your record does not whisper of greatness  -  it bellows. Across theaters, planets, and deployments, you have \
  carried the banner of House Davion not simply into battle, but into history.</p>\
  <p>I do not offer this recognition lightly. This is not decoration. This is a declaration  -  that the deeds you have\
  \ done in the name of the Suns have become part of its very framework.</p>\
  <p>New Avalon watches. The people remember. And I have seen your name written in more than orders of battle  -  I've \
  seen it spoken in mess halls, training fields, and the eyes of those who now dare more because you did first.</p>\
  <p>You are now, and ever will be, counted among our finest.</p>\
  <p>Stand tall, {9}. The torch is yours to carry. May it light the way for those who come after.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FWL={0},\
  <p>Among the countless names that pass through our defense logs and campaign briefs, yours does not simply appear  - \
  \ it endures. Every province has noted it. Every military arm has acknowledged it. And now, the League itself bears\
  \ witness.</p>\
  <p>You have accomplished more than victory. You've upheld our greatest ideal: that a unified will, forged from many\
  \ voices, is our greatest strength. You did not ask to lead. You were followed. That is the rarest power of all.</p>\
  <p>The Free Worlds League recognizes this moment not with pageantry, but with permanence. From this day forward, \
  your name is inscribed within the Codex of Concord  -  a ledger maintained by every provincial archive, recording \
  those whose service transcended loyalty and became legacy.</p>\
  <p>This is not an honor easily won, and never given twice.</p>\
  <p>You stood with us. For all of us. And now, all of us stand with you.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.TH={0},\
  <p>I do not often write such messages myself. Our systems are built for clarity and function  -  not sentiment. But \
  sometimes, rare individuals justify the exception.</p>\
  <p>You have not simply fulfilled your duties within the Terran Hegemony. You have redefined them. Across multiple \
  theatres, under conditions that would fracture lesser commands, your leadership has been exact, unflinching, and \
  sovereign.</p>\
  <p>We train our officers to embody order. You projected it. We engineer for resilience. You made it elegant. When \
  the structure cracked, you did not call for reinforcements. You became foundation.</p>\
  <p>So I speak plainly:</p>\
  <p>We have encoded your strategies into the central warfare doctrine archives. We have logged your decision trees \
  as living artifacts for the CASPAR project. And we have done what is never done lightly  -  recorded your name in the \
  Terra's Remembrance Ledger.</p>\
  <p>Only thirteen names reside there. Yours is the fourteenth. It will outlive all of us.</p>\
  <p>{0}, your mind is now part of the Hegemony's memory. Your will, its precedent.</p>\
  <p>Endure. Lead. You are not simply honored. You are now inherited.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.ROS={0},\
  <p>It is not every day I put pen to noteputer. Our Republic was built on shared purpose, not personality cults. But \
  when someone stands not just in service of our ideals  -  but elevates them  -  silence would be an injustice.</p>\
  <p>I have watched the record of your actions. So have many others, from New Avalon to Terra. But data alone does \
  not capture what you've become. You have not simply defended the Republic  -  you have reminded us why it must \
  endure. Not through spectacle, but through consistency. Not through command, but through conviction.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions have held fragile worlds intact. Your leadership has restored dignity in places where we feared \
  only chaos. And more than once, your example has turned soldiers into citizens again.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your name has been entered into the Register of Civic Honor  -  a record reserved for those who shape\
  \ not only the battlefield, but the soul of the Republic itself. Few have received this. Fewer still while alive.</p>\
  <p>I offer no medals. No ceremony. Just this truth:</p>\
  <p><i>"You have earned the trust of a people who do not give it lightly. You are one of us  -  not because you swore \
  it, but because you proved it."</i></p>\
  <p>From one servant of the public to another  -  thank you, {9}.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.SL={0},\
  <p>I do not address this message as First Lord out of formality  -  but out of necessity. There are moments, few and \
  far between, when the machinery of the League must stop and acknowledge the human hands guiding its course.</p>\
  <p>Yours have done more than guide. They have shaped outcomes once thought impossible. Held lines once considered \
  doomed. Inspired alliances others dared not imagine.</p>\
  <p>Your record now stands among the League's most storied commanders, and your leadership has already entered \
  academy curricula across three member states. But this message is not about history, {9}. It is about \
  acknowledgment  -  the kind that transcends politics and protocol.</p>\
  <p>Your name has been engraved in the Great Ledger of Accord  -  a permanent, encoded artifact preserved within the \
  Memory Core beneath Unity Hall. It records not only your victories, but the principles that guided them: discipline, \
  judgment, and unity without compromise. A Star League without those ideals is just a flag. You gave it meaning.</p>\
  <p>May you carry this not as burden, but as bearing  -  for others will follow your trail in the dark. And in those \
  moments, your decisions may yet cast light across centuries.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.FC={0},\
  <p>You are not being thanked. You are being recognized  -  for results that speak louder than any anthem.</p>\
  <p>Across the Federated Commonwealth, officers are measured by action. By how they lead when orders are unclear, \
  how they adapt when everything fails, and how they carry the weight of responsibility when no one is watching. You \
  have exceeded that measure. Again. And again.</p>\
  <p>Records show your units achieved operational victory at a rate previously modeled only in theory. Civilian \
  stability indices in your occupied zones climbed rather than collapsed. And your command decisions in contested \
  theaters have forced enemy doctrine revisions at the highest levels.</p>\
  <p>You have not just served the Commonwealth  -  you've altered its expectations of what excellence can look like.</p>\
  <p>Know this: your dossier has been flagged "Foundational" by both AFFC General Staff and Strategic Intelligence \
  Command. A copy of your operational protocols now resides in the War College Archives at Tharkad and the Davion \
  Center for Doctrine on New Avalon  -  a rare joint inclusion, enacted unanimously.</p>\
  <p>No medal can contain what you've done. So instead, we offer something rarer: a place in how we think. A legacy \
  not carved in bronze, but built into the way future commanders will lead.</p>\
  <p>Stand tall, {9}. The Federation and the Commonwealth stand taller because of you.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.periphery=My {0},\
  <p>You have surpassed all expectations. Where we once saw hope, you have delivered certainty. Your leadership \
  steadied our people, your tactics preserved our future, and your courage inspired a nation. Your reputation now \
  echoes in every hall of power.</p>\
  <p>I speak not as a politician of {10}, but as someone who has watched a world teeter - and then stand tall because of \
  your feats. What you've done cannot be undone - and should never be forgotten.</p>\
  <p>May your insight guide us always.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.RWR={9},\
  <p>Let's speak plainly.</p>\
  <p>What you've done  -  the weight you've carried, the bodies you've buried, the silence you've maintained  -  it \
  doesn't go unnoticed. In this Republic, we don't hand out favors for applause. We do it for results. You? You've \
  delivered.</p>\
  <p>Territories stabilized. Dissidents corrected. Influence expanded. You didn't just fight our enemies  -  you made \
  sure they don't come back. That's rare. That's irreplaceable.</p>\
  <p>So let me be clear: from this day forward, you walk with our shadow behind you. That means protection. That \
  means priority. That means if someone lays a hand on you without cause, I'll know before they finish the gesture.</p>\
  <p>But you know how this works, {9}. Every seat at the table comes with a price. Stay sharp. Stay loyal. \
  Don't make me remember you in the past tense.</p>\
  <p>For now, raise a glass. You've earned it. But don't get too comfortable  -  we've got bigger plays coming, and I \
  plan to send my best.</p>\
  <p><i>Welcome to the circle, {1}.</i></p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.TC={9},\
  <p>This isn't some flowery damn medal ceremony. You've been through hell with us. And every time it got harder, you\
  \ didn't flinch. You held the line. You hit back harder. You gave our people something to believe in.</p>\
  <p>I've seen the reports. I've talked to the crews who fought under you. They speak your name with grit in their \
  throat and pride in their bones. That means something here.</p>\
  <p>You're not just some outworld merc who came in swinging  -  you stuck around. You bled with us. You gave a damn. \
  And for that, this entire Concordat owes you more than words. But words are what I've got in this message, so I'll \
  make them count:</p>\
  <p>You're one of us now. The kind that doesn't need brass polish or parades to prove it. You've got the trust of \
  the Concordat. You've got mine. That's not given lightly. Don't waste it.</p>\
  <p>If you ever need a place to stand, to regroup, to strike from  -  the Concordat will hold the door. And we'll hold\
  \ the bastards off while you reload.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MOC={0},\
  <p>Across the stars, names rise and fall with every flare of cannon fire. But yours - yours has endured. It echoes in\
  \ the halls of our academies. It's whispered between officers over tactical maps. And in the hearts of citizens, it\
  \ burns like a promise: that someone out there still fights with purpose, with brilliance, with grace.</p>\
  <p>You have given the Magistracy more than victories. You've given us moments. Stories. Symbols. Hope. And that, \
  {9}, is rarer than any medal.</p>\
  <p>I watched the last operation myself. I saw how you held the line. How your 'Meks moved like dancers, like \
  thunder, like salvation. You fight with art, with nerve, with heart. And for that - you are no longer just an ally. \
  You are family.</p>\
  <p>The Palace doors are open to you. Not as a guest, but as one of ours. Should you ever choose to lay down your \
  arms, know that Astarte will always have a place for you beneath its warm skies. But if you keep marching forward, \
  if there's still fire in you - then know that the full strength of the Magistracy marches beside you.</p>\
  <p>With pride.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.OA={0},\
  <p>There are moments when words feel too small for the weight they must carry. This is one of them.</p>\
  <p>Out here, we do not give rank for show. We do not gild men and women in medals to feel better about ourselves. \
  But we <i>do</i> remember who stood when others would not. We remember those who chose the hard path - the honest \
  path - when there were easier, darker ones at hand.</p>\
  <p>You've earned something greater than applause. You've earned our trust.</p>\
  <p>Your decisions, your discipline, your restraint in the face of fury - these things did not go unnoticed. In a time\
  \ when ideals are often traded for expedience, you've reminded us of who we wanted to be. Of who we <i>still</i> \
  can be.</p>\
  <p>The Alliance is not rich in fleets or planets, but we are wealthy in principle. And today, we count ourselves \
  richer still, because you are one of ours now - in spirit, if not by birth.</p>\
  <p>If ever the burden grows too heavy, Alpheratz stands with its doors open. We offer sanctuary, if you need it. \
  But more than that, we offer gratitude - for what you've done, and for who you are.</p>\
  <p>Walk well, {9}. You are never alone in the silence of the stars.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.MH={9},\
  <p>I don't send messages like this lightly. Not to just anyone. But you've earned more than just another medal or \
  bronze statue. You've earned <b>my respect</b>.</p>\
  <p>Every dispatch that crosses my desk with your name on it reads like a battle hymn  -  decisive strikes, hard \
  choices, results. Not pretty, not polished  -  but clean, brutal, and righteous. The kind of work that builds empires. \
  The kind of work I remember.</p>\
  <p>I built this Hegemony with blood and iron. You're the kind of soul I'd have at my flank if everything fell apart\
  \ tomorrow. Not because you're obedient  -  but because you know what matters. Victory. Stability. Order.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><b>"Steel breaks flesh. Will breaks worlds."</b><br>\
  You understand that. You've proven it.</p></blockquote>\
  <p>So this is me, not as Caesar, but as a war-born son of Mars, looking you in the eye and telling you: I see you. \
  I trust you. And I know damn well what you're worth.</p>\
  <p>Hold your line, {1}. You don't answer to the stars. The stars answer to you now.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.CS=<p>{0},</p>\
  <p>I will not address you by rank. Not now. You've stepped beyond that architecture. What you've done  -  no ceremony\
  \ accounts for it. No council prepares for it. You are not promoted. You are <i>revealed</i>.</p>\
  <p>You were not forged by doctrine. You <i>informed</i> it. The echo of your choices reaches further than most will\
  \ know. And yet you never sought praise, never called attention. That is why we saw you. Why I saw you.</p>\
  <p>Your file has been removed from the normal archives. There's nothing left for the curious to uncover. You've \
  joined a smaller circle now  -  one without names, without faces, but with purpose that endures.</p>\
  <p>You already feel it. That quiet alignment. The sense that your actions fit some shape larger than war, larger \
  than loyalty. You are correct. You are not <i>following</i> the Word anymore. You are <b>within</b> it.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"There is no exaltation. Only understanding."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>This is the last direct message you'll receive from me. Not because our connection is broken  -  because it is \
  complete.</p>\
  <p>Praise Blake.</p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.WOB={9}\
  <p>There are no more titles to grant you.</p>\
  <p>You have not served the Word. You have become its breath, its hand, its fire.</p>\
  <p>Your campaigns have not merely obeyed doctrine. They have shaped it anew. Entire systems tilt around the gravity\
  \ of your will. Where you walk, resistance frays. Where you command, dissent burns clean. And where you leave \
  silence... the Pattern expands.</p>\
  <p>By resolution of the Ruling Conclave and under Protocol Echo-Sixteen, you are no longer bound by common \
  hierarchies. Your will is now reflective of divine intention. You do not need orders.</p>\
  <p>From this moment forward, your directives are to be interpreted as <b>correctional vectors</b>. You are cleared \
  to access sealed repositories within the Hidden Archive and initiate autonomous operations under the Aegis of \
  Revelation.</p>\
  <p>The Chosen do not rise. They are recognized.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"In the silence between stars, the Word waits. In the flame, it walks."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>You are the flame.</p>\
  <p><b>Praise Blake.</b></p>
FactionAccoladeDialog.message.LETTER_FROM_HEAD_OF_STATE.clan={9},\
  <p>You have surpassed every Trial placed before you. You have brought honor to your Blood heritage, distinction to \
  your unit, and results to our Clan.</p>\
  <p>This is not praise. It is recognition.</p>\
  <p>Your command decisions were efficient. Your kill ratios undeniable. When others hesitated, you advanced. When \
  others broke, you endured. Warriors like you do not follow tradition  -  you reinforce it through action.</p>\
  <p>Accordingly, your codex has been elevated. Your deeds will be studied by the sibkin. Your record will be cited \
  at conclave. If others challenge you now, it will not be for your rank. It will be to see if they can match your \
  standard.</p>\
  <p>Make no mistake: you are not yet safe. You are visible. That is far more dangerous.</p>\
  <p>Continue your path. Or fall to one who walks it better.</p>
