# Arrived Early Dialog
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.0={0}, we''ve completed atmospheric insertion and offloading without incident. All transports\
  \ are accounted for, and the full complement of vehicles, personnel, and equipment has been deployed to the designated\
  \ LZs.\
  <p>We''re ahead of schedule by approximately <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b>. This gives us a rare window to\
  \ establish forward logistics, perform maintenance checks, and give crews some rest before the op window opens.\
  \ Engineering teams are already setting up temporary fortifications and hardpoints. Local terrain is stable, with no\
  \ immediate environmental hazards.</p>\
  <p>Let''s hope our luck continues.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.1=Drop successful, {0}. All assets are planet-side, accounted for, and secured. We are <b>{1}\
  \ {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of schedule.\
  <p>FOB construction is underway. Crew rotations, field checks, and supply caches are being prioritized. No hostiles\
  \ detected in the immediate vicinity. Comms relay is up and clean.<p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.2=Hey {0}, touchdown was smooth. We''re boots down and unpacked - even the damn paint jobs made\
  \ it without a scratch. <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of the op. Feels weird, not rushing.\
  <p>We''re getting dug in. Engineers are grinning ear to ear. Gonna run some engine checks and maybe let the pilots\
  \ stretch their legs. I''ll just get the sensors calibrated for the local atmospherics, let me know if you need\
  \ anything.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.3={0} we''ve landed <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of operational D-Day. Current\
  \ focus is force consolidation, terrain mapping, and logistical redundancy.\
  <p>I recommend delaying any aggressive posturing until we confirm no hostile recon units are operating in the area.\
  \ Sensors are clean, but that won''t last.</p>\
  <p>I''ll get to working with Allied Command to establish early warning perimeters.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.4=We''re in! All transports landed safe, {0}, and gear is unloading ahead of pace. No resistance,\
  \ no complications. <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of schedule.\
  <p>The crews are in high spirits - rare for a job like this. We''ve already started layout for a forward depot and have\
  \ patrols mapped for tomorrow morning.</p>\
  <p>If the weather holds, I''ll see about stocking up our fuel reserves before things get spicy.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.5={0}, we''ve landed without incident - <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of schedule.\
  \ LZ is secure, and transports are undergoing final system checks.\
  <p>Given the time window, I recommend green-lighting deep recon into sectors Delta and Echo. We can gather intel on\
  \ local infrastructure, possibly disrupt enemy logistics before the op begins. I''ve already got volunteers from Allied\
  \ Command willing to work with us.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.6=We made it down, {0}. Everything''s here, no losses. That''s the good news. We''re about <b>{1}\
  \ {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of schedule. That''s the weird news.\
  <p>The men are on edge. Quiet''s never good this far from home. I''ve got the techs running diagnostics and the scouts\
  \ doing lazy circles, but the locals are ghosted - not even a comm squawk.</p>\
  <p>Let''s not waste the quiet. On Go-Day, I recommend we hit the valleys first.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.7=We landed. Nothing exploded. Nothing got jammed. Even the heavy haulers behaved. Either we''ve\
  \ hit a lucky streak, {0}, or someone''s about to drop a piano on us.\
  <p>We''re <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> early, which feels illegal. Depot''s being set up, power''s stable, and\
  \ I''ve got teams poking around the nearby ridgelines for surprises.</p>\
  <p>Let me know how paranoid you want us to be.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.8=Insertion complete. Assets planet-side, zero interference. {0} we''re <b>{1}\
  \ {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> ahead of projected op schedule.\
  <p>Per protocol, establishing low-profile staging area. All comms encrypted and minimized. Initial scans show no signs\
  \ of surveillance or response. Weather favorable for light recon.</p>\
  <p>I''m going to go-ahead and initiate silent recon sweeps and shadow logistics movement.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ic.9={0}, you may want to sit down: we landed without incident. No blown landing gear, no surprise\
  \ ambush, not even a jammed cargo ramp. The last crate of ammo even matched its manifest. I triple-checked - it''s real.\
  <p>We''re <b>{1} {1, choice, 0#days|1#day|2#days}</b> early, which is a lot more than we usually get before jumping into\
  \ the fire. The crews are resting, pretending not to be terrified by the silence. Engineering is already fortifying like\
  \ we''re expecting a pregnant JumpShip to appear out of spite.</p>\
  <p>Let me know how many patrols you want doing busywork until the real shooting starts. I''ll be in the motor pool,\
  \ daring fate to screw this up.</p>
contract.arrivedEarly.ooc=You are free to advance days until the contract begins.
