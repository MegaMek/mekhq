txtInstructions.Overview.text=The turnover check involves rolling 2d6 and comparing the result to the target number. If the roll is less than the target number, the individual will leave the campaign. If the individual is not under contract, they will need to be paid a final payout.\
  \n\
  \nPaying a retention bonus decreases an individual's target number by 2, but this can get expensive, so should be used sparingly.\

  \nIf this is your first time seeing this screen, please take a moment to read the documentation in 'docs/personnel modules/Turnover & Retention Module.pdf'.
txtInstructions.Results.text=Combat personnel who brought their units with them should be given a unit upon departure. If no unit of the appropriate weight class and technology is available, the retiree is compensated in C-bills.\
  \n\
  \nAny pilots with a final payout value of zero have either been compensated with a unit that meets or exceeds the payout amount, or are breaking their employment contract.
