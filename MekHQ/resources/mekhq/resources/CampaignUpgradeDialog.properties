CampaignUpgradeDialog.inCharacter={0}, fantastic news: we''ve just had an update to our command and control software,\
  \ with loads of new features!\
  <p>By the way, I thought I should tell you that the system is gonna be compiling for about 15-20 minutes so some of\
  \ the minor systems might go on and off, but it''s nothing to worry about.</p>\
  <p>In the meanwhile, I''ve included a few options so you can restore full operational control.</p>
CampaignUpgradeDialog.outOfCharacter=<h2>STOP: Have You Backed Up Your Save?</h2>\
  While every effort is made to ensure the stability of every release, mistakes can be made. Please make sure to \
  create a backup of your campaign before proceeding past this point.\
  <h2>Upgrading Versions</h2>\
  Once you have backed up your save, please select your preferred preset. This will ensure your campaign options \
  are fully upgraded to the latest version. Alternatively, you may select 'Manual' to adjust the settings by hand.\
  <p>Please note that selecting a preset will overwrite your current campaign settings.</p>\
  <h2>Crucial Points</h2>\
  It is no longer necessary to wait until you are out-of-contract to upgrade versions. Nor do you need to open and \
  close campaign options or even advance day. Everything is handled for you. However, we <b>strongly</b> recommend \
  selecting one of the stock presets every few versions as a lot of key balancing is handled within those presets.</p>\
  <h2>Final Words</h2>\
  Last, but certainly not least, enjoy the new version!\
  <p>If you encounter any bugs, consider opening a bug report on our dedicated GitHub. Your feedback helps us keep \
  making MekHQ the best Mek Management tool in the Inner Sphere.</p>\
  <p>Good hunting</p>\
