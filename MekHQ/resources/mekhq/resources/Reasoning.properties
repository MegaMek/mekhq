SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.0={0} once tried to reload a combat knife. {1}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ been known to salute the wrong superior, sometimes twice in a row. No one knows how {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s}\
  \ still alive, but {2} {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} orders with unwavering enthusiasm - sometimes\
  \ even the right ones.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.1={0} struggles to keep up. {1}''{7, choice, 0#fumble|1#fumbles}\
  \ through conversations, {7, choice, 0#miss|1#misses} critical details, and often {7, choice, 0#stand|1#stands}\
  \ in confused silence while others move on. In a universe that chews up the weak, {0} survives\
  \ only because someone takes pity on {4}.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.2={0} doesn''t overthink things - because {2} can''t.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} orders without question, {7, choice, 0#move|1#moves} when told,\
  \ and {7, choice, 0#work|1#works} when pointed in the right direction.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.3={0} is slow, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} reliable. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} {6} commanders without question, never {2} {7, choice, 0#hesitate|1#hesitates}\
  \ to help, and {2} {7, choice, 0#face|1#faces} trouble with a clueless grin. {1} may not be bright,\
  \ but in a war-torn galaxy, loyalty is worth more than intelligence.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.4={0} doesn''t hesitate because {2} {7, choice, 0#lack|1#lacks}\
  \ the sense to be afraid. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} problems, {2} {7, choice, 0#smash|1#smashes}\
  \ them. No questions, no doubts - just raw, unstoppable force. You don''t reason with {0}. You\
  \ just try to stay out of {6} way.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.5={0} doesn''t understand the war {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ fighting, the orders {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} given, or the world {2} {7, choice, 0#live|1#lives}\
  \ in. {1} just {7, choice, 0#march|1#marches} forward, doing {6} best, never questioning why people\
  \ sigh when they talk to {4}. {1} {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows} {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} slow. {1} just\
  \ {7, choice, 0#hope|1#hopes} no one leaves {4} behind.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.6={0} doesn''t question orders because thinking never did\
  \ {4} any favors. {1} just {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} what {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} told. The galaxy\
  \ needs bodies more than it needs minds, and {0}''s body still moves, no matter how many times it\
  \ gets knocked down.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.7={0} doesn''t understand mathematics, but {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#understand|1#understands} trust. If you tell {4} to run into fire, {2} will - without\
  \ hesitation, without fear. {1} may not be smart enough to survive on {6} own, but {2}''ll die before\
  \ {2} {7, choice, 0#let|1#lets} {6} comrades down.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.8={0}''s the kind of person who could trip over nothing,\
  \ stand up, and trip again. Whether {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} endearing or infuriating depends on\
  \ how much damage {2} caused that day.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.9={0} struggles with even simple tasks, always a step\
  \ behind, always waiting for someone to explain - again. In a universe where intelligence is\
  \ survival, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} painfully aware that {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not built to\
  \ last.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.10={0} doesn''t think, and that makes {4} reliable. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} what {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} told, no questions asked, no hesitation.\
  \ In a galaxy ruled by war and corruption, sometimes that''s the only skill that matters.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.11={0} is slow, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} steady. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows}, {2} {7, choice, 0#listen|1#listens}, and {2} never\
  \ {7, choice, 0#betray|1#betrays} those who look out for {4}. In a universe full of liars and\
  \ backstabbers, {6} simple loyalty is a rare kind of strength.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.12={0} doesn''t stop because {0} doesn''t understand why\
  \ {2} should. {1} {7, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} going, {7, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} pushing,\
  \ {7, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} breaking things because no one told {4} to stop - at least not in a\
  \ way {2} could process.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.13={0} doesn''t understand the stakes, but that won''t save\
  \ {4}. {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} just another warm body in a galaxy that chews through people like\
  \ {4} without a second thought. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} see it coming, but everyone else\
  \ does.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.14={0} doesn''t trust books or fancy words, but {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#swear|1#swears} by luck, gut {7, choice, 0#feeling|1#feelings}, and whatever omen\
  \ {2} read in last night''s stew. Maybe {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} just dumb, or maybe the universe\
  \ really is whispering secrets only {2} can hear.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.15={0} doesn''t understand pain the way others do. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes} the hit, {7, choice, 0#dust|1#dusts} {4}self off, and\
  \ {7, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps} moving, long after anyone else would''ve given up. Maybe it''s\
  \ resilience. Maybe {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} just too slow to realize {2} should be dead.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.16=The galaxy is burning, but {0} doesn''t see it. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#smile|1#smiles} through chaos, {7, choice, 0#hum|1#hums} to {4}self in war zones,\
  \ and {7, choice, 0#shrug|1#shrugs} off problems like they don''t exist. {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ either the happiest person alive or the most tragically oblivious.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.17=There was a time when {0} might have been more, but\
  \ whatever spark {2} once had is long gone. Whether it was war, tragedy, or just bad luck, what\
  \ remains is a person who follows, obeys, and exists - nothing more.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.18={0} doesn''t ask for much - just a quiet place, a warm\
  \ meal, and maybe a sky without smoke. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} understand the wars, the\
  \ politics, or the surrounding struggles. {1} just {7, choice, 0#hope|1#hopes}, somehow, that life\
  \ will be kind enough to let {4} be.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.19={0} doesn''t question, doesn''t doubt - {2} just\
  \ {7, choice, 0#do|1#does}. {1} {7, choice, 0#move|1#moves} forward when told, and {7, choice, 0#keep|1#keeps}\
  \ going long after a smarter person would have stopped. In a universe where thinking gets you killed,\
  \ maybe that makes {4} perfect.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.20={0} gets overlooked, passed by, ignored. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#try|1#tries} to keep up, but the world doesn''t slow down for {4}. One day, {2}''ll\
  \ fall behind for good, and the saddest part? No one will even notice.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.21={0} makes decisions that defy all logic - and somehow,\
  \ {2} {7, choice, 0#survive|1#survives}. Walking through a minefield? No problem. Charging into\
  \ battle with no plan? Worked last time. The universe should have killed {4} by now, but for reasons\
  \ unknown, it hasn''t.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.22={0} doesn''t make it on {6} own. {1} {7, choice, 0#need|1#needs}\
  \ orders, direction, someone to tell {4} where to go and what to do. Without that, {2} {7, choice, 0#stand|1#stands}\
  \ frozen, waiting, lost. {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not stupid enough to think {2} can survive alone.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.23={0} doesn''t understand cause and effect, doesn''t grasp\
  \ fear, doesn''t think about tomorrow. {1} just {7, choice, 0#move|1#moves}, {7, choice, 0#act|1#acts},\
  \ {7, choice, 0#react|1#reacts}. A machine has more purpose than {4}. At least a machine was built\
  \ for something.
SIGNIFICANTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.24=Something went wrong with {0} - maybe at birth, maybe\
  \ later. {5} mind is a half-finished thing, stumbling through a galaxy that only values what it\
  \ can use.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.0={0} isn''t the sharpest, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got heart. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#nod|1#nods} along in conversations, pretending to understand, and usually figures\
  \ things out - eventually. {1} might not be quick, but at least {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} persistent.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.1={0} isn''t smart, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} careful. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#listen|1#listens}, {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows}, and {7, choice, 0#do|1#does}\
  \ {6} best to learn from mistakes. {1} might take longer to get there, but in a universe where the\
  \ reckless die first, slow and steady isn''t the worst thing to be.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.2={0} doesn''t think fast, but {2} {7, choice, 0#work|1#works} hard. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} orders, {7, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} {6} comrades, and never\
  \ {7, choice, 0#quit|1#quits}. {1} {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows} {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not the\
  \ smartest, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} reliable, and in a war-torn galaxy, that''s worth more\
  \ than a quick wit.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.3={0} understands just enough to know {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} behind.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} the looks when {2} {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes} too long,\
  \ {7, choice, 0#hear|1#hears} the sighs when {2} {7, choice, 0#ask|1#asks} a question. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#try|1#tries} to keep up, but deep down, {2} {7, choice, 0#wonder|1#wonders} if {2}\
  \ ever really will.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.4={0} doesn''t overthink things, and maybe that''s an advantage. While\
  \ others hesitate, {2} {7, choice, 0#act|1#acts}. {1} might not see every angle, but sometimes, a\
  \ simple approach is the best one.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.5={0} listens, {2} really does, but by the time {2} {7, choice, 0#figure|1#figures}\
  \ out the plan, it''s already happening. {1} {7, choice, 0#nod|1#nods} like {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#understand|1#understands}, hoping no one asks {4} to explain. Sometimes {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#get|1#gets} it right. Sometimes {2} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.6={0} isn''t quick, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} dependable. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#learn|1#learns} by doing, repeating tasks until they stick. {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ not the person you call for strategy, but if you need something done and don''t care how long it\
  \ takes, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} your person.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.7={0} believes people are good - sometimes to {6} own detriment. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} orders without suspicion, {7, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} {6}\
  \ friends completely, and {7, choice, 0#assume|1#assumes} things will work out. It makes {4} easy\
  \ to like... and even easier to take advantage of.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.8={0} doesn''t do complicated. Big ideas, long plans, fancy maneuvers -\
  \ none of that makes sense to {4}. {1} {7, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} to what works: simple solutions,\
  \ direct actions. If a problem needs fixing, {2} {7, choice, 0#fix|1#fixes} it. No need to think too\
  \ hard about it.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.9={0} isn''t an idiot, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not special either.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows} there''s always someone smarter, faster, better. {1}''ll do {6} job\
  \ until {2} can''t anymore, and when that day comes, the unit will just find another {0} to take\
  \ {6} place.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.10={0} can focus - sometimes too much. Give {4} one task, and {2}''ll get\
  \ it done. Give {4} two, and something''s getting forgotten. {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not slow,\
  \ exactly - just... easily overwhelmed.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.11={0} isn''t a natural thinker, but experience is a brutal teacher.\
  \ {1}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} made mistakes, survived them, and slowly, painfully, figured things out.\
  \ {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not quick, but {2} {7, choice, 0#learn|1#learns}. Eventually.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.12={0} assumes people mean what they say, that things are as they seem,\
  \ and that life isn''t as complicated as others make it out to be. It''s not innocence - it''s just\
  \ how {2} {7, choice, 0#think|1#thinks}. And maybe, in a universe like this, that''s rare enough to\
  \ be valuable.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.13={0} doesn''t waste time on things {2} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ understand. {1} {7, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on what works - what {2} can see, touch, and do.\
  \ High-level plans and grand ideas mean nothing to {4}, but give {4} a task, and {2}''ll see it\
  \ through.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.14={0} doesn''t need to be smart. {1} just {7, choice, 0#need|1#needs} to\
  \ do what {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} told. And in a galaxy run by warlords, corporations, and ''Meks\
  \ that turn men into pulp, that''s all most people ever are - cogs, grinding away until they break.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.15={0}''s got a knack for plans that almost work. Almost. {5} solutions\
  \ are simple, direct, and usually cause twice as many problems as they solve. But sometimes, one\
  \ actually works - and those are the moments {2} {7, choice, 0#live|1#lives} for.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.16={0} isn''t stupid, just slow. {1} can figure things out, but only if\
  \ given the chance - which life rarely does. {1} {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} {6} best with what {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#have|1#has}, but in a world that moves too fast, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} always\
  \ playing catch-up.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.17={0} doesn''t lead, but {2} {7, choice, 0#follow|1#follows} with\
  \ everything {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got. Tell {4} what to do, and {2}''ll give it {6} all. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#trust|1#trusts} completely, {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} loyally, and\
  \ {7, choice, 0#stick|1#sticks} with {6} comrades no matter what. Sometimes, that''s more valuable\
  \ than brains.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.18={0} doesn''t understand everything, but {2} {7, choice, 0#understand|1#understands}\
  \ momentum. Keep moving, keep working, don''t stop to think too hard. Thinking too much only slows\
  \ you down - and in a universe like this, slowing down gets you killed.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.19={0} doesn''t second-guess {4}self - ever. {1} {7, choice, 0#deliver|1#delivers}\
  \ {6} answers with absolute certainty. Unfortunately, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} usually wrong. But\
  \ hey, confidence counts for something, right?
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.20={0} doesn''t process things fast, so {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} learned\
  \ to trust {6} gut. If something feels wrong, {2} {7, choice, 0#move|1#moves}. If a fight starts,\
  \ {2} {7, choice, 0#hit|1#hits} first. {1} might not understand the details, but {2} {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows}\
  \ enough to stay alive.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.21={0} knows {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not the smartest, so {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#ask|1#asks} - constantly. Some get annoyed, others laugh, but at the end of the\
  \ day, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} trying. And sometimes, {6} dumbest questions are the ones that make\
  \ people think the hardest.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.22={0} doesn''t do nuance. If there''s a problem, {2} {7, choice, 0#pick|1#picks}\
  \ the most direct way to solve it. That doesn''t always make {4} efficient, but it does make {4}\
  \ predictable - and in a galaxy full of schemers, there''s value in that.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.23={0} doesn''t think much because {2} {7, choice, 0#were|1#was} never\
  \ allowed to. From the moment {2} could work, {2} worked. From the moment {2} could fight, {2} fought.\
  \ Thinking is a luxury, and for people like {0}, luxuries don''t exist.
BELOW_AVERAGE.description.24={0} was never meant to be anything more than what {2} {7, choice, 0#are|1#is}\
  \ - just another hand to pull a trigger, another body to throw into the grinder. No thoughts, no\
  \ future, no dreams. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} think because no one ever wanted {4} to. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#were|1#was} made to follow orders, and one day, {2}''ll die following them. Nothing\
  \ more, nothing less.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.0={0}''s got a decent head on {6} shoulders, but sometimes {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#overestimate|1#overestimates} {4}self. {1} {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows} just enough\
  \ to sound confident - until someone smarter asks {4} to explain. Still, {2} {7, choice, 0#bluff|1#bluffs}\
  \ {6} way through more often than you''d expect.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.1={0} understands that {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not a genius,\
  \ but {2} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} need to be. {1} {7, choice, 0#listen|1#listens},\
  \ {7, choice, 0#learn|1#learns}, and {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} the best decisions {2} can with\
  \ the knowledge {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has}. {1} might not always get it right, but {2} never stops\
  \ trying.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.2={0} isn''t the fastest thinker, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ practical, dependable, and always willing to learn. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} get caught\
  \ up in ego or ambition - {2} just {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} {6} job and {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} it\
  \ well. The galaxy could use more like {0}.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.3={0} doesn''t waste time overcomplicating things. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} problems, finds solutions, and gets things done. {1}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ not a strategist or a philosopher, but in a world where action matters more than theory, that''s\
  \ not a bad thing.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.4={0} is just another face in the crowd. Smart enough to\
  \ survive, competent enough to be useful, but never remarkable. In a galaxy driven by war, power,\
  \ and ambition, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} just another cog in the machine - useful today, replaceable\
  \ tomorrow.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.5={0} can follow along well enough, but sometimes {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#overthink|1#overthinks} things and {7, choice, 0#outsmart|1#outsmarts} {4}self.\
  \ {1}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} got just enough brains to try something risky, but not always enough\
  \ foresight to see why it was a bad idea.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.6={0} doesn''t waste time with theory - {2} {7, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses}\
  \ on what works. {1} might not be the smartest, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} grounded, methodical,\
  \ and {7, choice, 0#learn|1#learns} from experience. In a world where survival is the only test\
  \ that matters, {2} {7, choice, 0#pass|1#passes} every day.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.7={0} doesn''t need to be brilliant - {2} just {7, choice, 0#need|1#needs}\
  \ to be reliable. {1} {7, choice, 0#think|1#thinks} through problems, takes advice when needed, and\
  \ doesn''t let pride get in the way of learning. {1} may not be exceptional, but {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ someone you can count on.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.8={0} understands the world well enough to know that thinking\
  \ too much gets people killed. {1} {7, choice, 0#focus|1#focuses} on {6} job, {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t}\
  \ ask too many questions, and {7, choice, 0#avoid|1#avoids} getting involved in things that don''t\
  \ concern {4}. It''s not cowardice - it''s survival.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.9={0} is the definition of average. {1}''ll live, work, and\
  \ eventually die without making a mark on history. No grand legacy, no lasting impact - just\
  \ another name in a forgotten personnel file, one of billions lost to time.
SLIGHTLY_BELOW_AVERAGE.description.10={0} can follow along just fine, but sometimes {6} brain\
