AMBITIOUS.label=Ambitious
AMBITIOUS.description.0={0} isn''t satisfied with just getting by - {2} {7, choice, 0#want|1#wants}\

AMBITIOUS.description.1={0} doesn''t just dream of greatness - {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} willing to\
  \ do whatever it takes to achieve it. Compromise, mercy, and hesitation are for those too weak to\
  \ seize what they want. {1}''ll fight, scheme, and claw {6} way to the top, no matter who gets in\
  \ {6} way.
AMBITIOUS.description.2={0} knows where {2} {7, choice, 0#want|1#wants} to be, and {2}\

AMBITIOUS.description.3={0} refuses to settle for mediocrity. Every step {2} {7, choice, 0#take|1#takes}\

  \ just another form of failure.
AMBITIOUS.description.4=For {0}, there''s always a next step, a bigger challenge, a greater prize\

  \ for the next opportunity to climb higher.
AMBITIOUS.description.5={0} isn''t content with following orders or playing it safe. {1}\

  \ and never {7, choice, 0#accept|1#accepts} limits - because to {4}, the only real obstacle is a\
  \ lack of ambition.
AMBITIOUS.ronin=I''ve been watching how you operate - you know how to win.\
  <p>I''m not here to get by. I''m not looking for a paycheck or a safe place. I want more. I know where\
  \ I''m going, and I know how to get there - but I need the right unit behind me. You''ve built something\
  \ strong. I can help push it higher - and take my shot at the top along the way.</p>\
  <p>We both want to win. Let''s make it happen.</p>
AMBITIOUS.interviewerNote.0=Never satisfied. Always reaching for more - rank, power, legacy.
AMBITIOUS.interviewerNote.1=Ruthless when needed. Mercy optional. Will climb over anyone in the way.
AMBITIOUS.interviewerNote.2=Strategic climber. Makes allies, cuts weight, eyes always on the prize.

ARROGANT.label=Arrogant
ARROGANT.description.0={0} is convinced {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} the best warrior, the best\
  \ tactician, and probably the smartest person in the room. {1} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} just\

ARROGANT.description.1={0} doesn''t just look down on others - {2} barely {7, choice, 0#acknowledge|1#acknowledges}\
  \ them. {1} {7, choice, 0#see|1#sees} {4}self as superior in every way, treating allies as tools\
  \ and enemies as annoyances. If someone disagrees with {4}, it''s because they''re too stupid to\
  \ understand why {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} right.
ARROGANT.description.2={0} never doubts {4}self, even when {2} absolutely should. {1} struts into\
  \ battle like {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already won and dismisses any challenge with a smirk. If\
  \ someone questions {6} skills, {2}''ll be the first to bet {6} wages on proving them wrong.
ARROGANT.description.3={0} doesn''t just have confidence - {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} certainty.\
  \ In {6} mind, {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} always the smartest, strongest, and most capable person\
  \ around, and anyone who disagrees is simply too blind to see it.
ARROGANT.description.4=There''s no room for doubt in {0}''s world - {2} already knows {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ right. {1} speaks with absolute authority, rarely {7, choice, 0#bother|1#bothers} to listen, and\
  \ treats any criticism as a waste of {6} valuable time.
ARROGANT.description.5={0} carries {4}self like a living legend, utterly convinced of {6} own\
  \ greatness. Whether {2} {7, choice, 0#deserve|1#deserves} the reputation doesn''t matter - {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#believe|1#believes} it, and that''s enough for {4}.
ARROGANT.ronin=Let''s skip the pleasantries - you need me.\
  <p>I''m the best at what I do. That''s not arrogance - it''s just the truth. Most people stumble around,\
  \ second-guessing themselves, hoping they make the right call. I don''t have that problem. I know\
  \ I''m right. And when the pressure''s on, you''ll want someone who doesn''t hesitate.</p>\
  <p>So - do you want the best, or are you comfortable with second place?</p>
ARROGANT.interviewerNote.0=Assumes superiority in everything. Believes others are just trying to catch up.
ARROGANT.interviewerNote.1=Barely acknowledges teammates. Sees people as tools or distractions.
ARROGANT.interviewerNote.2=Never doubts, even when wrong. Swagger first, strategy later.
ARROGANT.interviewerNote.3=Confidence hardened into certainty. No room for disagreement - only correction.
ARROGANT.interviewerNote.4=Doesn''t listen. Speaks like a prophet, ignores dissent like noise.
ARROGANT.interviewerNote.5=Walks like a legend. Doesn''t need to be right - just believes they are.
ASPIRING.label=Aspiring
ASPIRING.description.0={0} has big dreams and no intention of staying in the background. Whether\

ASPIRING.description.1={0} isn''t just chasing a dream - {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} clawing for\

  \ {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} not just another forgotten warrior.
ASPIRING.description.2={0} believes {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} meant for something more, and every\

  \ {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows} {2} can reach.
ASPIRING.description.3={0} isn''t content with where {2} {7, choice, 0#are|1#is} - {6} eyes are\

  \ setback as a lesson, all leading toward the future {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} determined to claim.
ASPIRING.description.4={0} knows that greatness isn''t given - it''s earned. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#push|1#pushes} {4}self harder than anyone else, refusing to accept limits, because\
  \ in {6} mind, every struggle brings {4} closer to {6} ultimate goal.
ASPIRING.description.5=Some people accept their place in the universe - {0} refuses to. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#dream|1#dreams} big, {7, choice, 0#fight|1#fights} hard, and never\
  \ {7, choice, 0#stop|1#stops} striving for something greater, no matter how distant or impossible\
  \ it may seem.
ASPIRING.ronin=I''m not here to fill a seat - I''m here to build something greater.\
  <p>You don''t play it safe - and neither do I. I''m ready to fight, bleed, and push harder than anyone\
  \ else because I know that''s what it takes. I don''t expect handouts - I''m ready to earn my way.</p>\
  <p>If you want someone comfortable staying in the background, keep looking. If you want someone\
  \ hungry for victory - someone ready to rise alongside you - you know where to find me.</p>
ASPIRING.interviewerNote.0=Has big goals and no plans to stay in the shadows. Ambition drives every move.
ASPIRING.interviewerNote.1=Fighting for more than glory - fighting to be remembered. Survival with purpose.
ASPIRING.interviewerNote.2=Believes they''re destined for more. Each battle is a stepping stone.
ASPIRING.interviewerNote.3=Not satisfied with now. Every obstacle is part of the climb.
ASPIRING.interviewerNote.4=Pushes harder than most. Sees struggle as proof they''re on the right path.
ASPIRING.interviewerNote.5=Rejects complacency. Dreams big, fights bigger - refuses to settle.
CALCULATING.label=Calculating
CALCULATING.description.0={0} never acts on impulse - every move {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} is\
  \ carefully thought out, every action weighed against its potential outcome. Whether in battle or\
  \ negotiations, {2} {7, choice, 0#play|1#plays} the long game, ensuring {2} always comes out ahead.
CALCULATING.description.1={0} doesn''t care about honor, mercy, or sentiment - only results. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#dissect|1#dissects} every situation with ruthless precision, seeing people as\
  \ assets, obstacles, or liabilities. If a sacrifice needs to be made, {2} won''t hesitate to pull\
  \ the trigger.
CALCULATING.description.2={0} isn''t interested in quick victories - {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s}\
  \ interested in certain victories. {1} {7, choice, 0#wait|1#waits}, {7, choice, 0#watch|1#watches},\
  \ and {7, choice, 0#maneuver|1#maneuvers} every piece into place before making {6} move,\
  \ ensuring that when the moment comes, {6} enemies never see it coming.
CALCULATING.description.3={0} sees every situation as a puzzle to be solved, every person as a\
  \ piece to be placed. {1} never {7, choice, 0#act|1#acts} without purpose, ensuring that each\
  \ decision moves {4} one step closer to {6} ultimate goal.
CALCULATING.description.4=Nothing {0} does is by chance - {2} {7, choice, 0#play|1#plays} the long\
  \ game, reading between the lines and thinking five steps ahead. By the time others realize what''s\
  \ happening, {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already won.
CALCULATING.description.5={0} measures everything - risks, rewards, weaknesses - before making a\
  \ move. To {4}, emotion is just another factor to manipulate, and hesitation is a flaw {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} no intention of indulging.
CALCULATING.ronin=I''ve been watching how you operate - and I like what I see.\
  <p>I don''t rush. I don''t gamble. Every move I make is calculated, every decision weighed. That''s\
  \ why I win - because I don''t play unless the odds lean my way. Your unit has potential, but I see\
  \ the gaps - and I know exactly how to close them.</p>\
  <p>I''m not here for glory. I''m here for results. Give me the opportunity, and I''ll deliver.</p>
CALCULATING.interviewerNote.0=Every move is measured. Long-game thinker, never impulsive.
CALCULATING.interviewerNote.1=Values results over sentiment. Cold strategist - sacrifices without pause.
CALCULATING.interviewerNote.2=Prefers certainty to speed. Strikes only when the board is set.
CALCULATING.interviewerNote.3=Treats people like game pieces. Every action serves a greater plan.
CALCULATING.interviewerNote.4=Always several moves ahead. Opponents realize too late they''ve lost.
CALCULATING.interviewerNote.5=Emotion is leverage, not weakness. Hesitation isn''t tolerated.
CONNIVING.label=Conniving
CONNIVING.description.0={0} is always working an angle, always looking for a way to manipulate\
  \ the situation to {6} advantage. {1} {7, choice, 0#play|1#plays} people like a chessboard, making\
  \ sure they never realize they were just another piece in {6} game.
CONNIVING.description.1=Loyalty is just a word, and {0} has no use for it. {1} {7, choice, 0#lie|1#lies},\
  \ {7, choice, 0#scheme|1#schemes}, and {7, choice, 0#betray|1#betrays} without hesitation, using\
  \ anyone and everyone to climb higher. If someone trusts {4}, they''ve already lost.
CONNIVING.description.2={0} doesn''t need brute force when a few well-placed words can do the job.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#weave|1#weaves} half-truths and clever deceptions with ease, turning enemies\
  \ against each other while {2} {7, choice, 0#walk|1#walks} away unscathed - and usually richer.
CONNIVING.description.3={0} never plays fair - {2} {7, choice, 0#play|1#plays} to win. Every promise,\
  \ every alliance, every deal is just another tool in {6} arsenal, and {2} always {7, choice, 0#ensure|1#ensures}\
  \ {2} {7, choice, 0#come|1#comes} out ahead.
CONNIVING.description.4=Trust is a weakness {0} has no interest in. {1} {7, choice, 0#maneuver|1#maneuvers}\
  \ through life like a shadow, twisting words, bending loyalties, and setting traps that only {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#know|1#knows} how to avoid.
CONNIVING.description.5={0}''s greatest weapon isn''t a gun - it''s {6} ability to manipulate. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#spin|1#spins} lies effortlessly, plants {7, choice, 0#doubt|1#doubts} where needed,\
  \ and ensures that by the time the truth comes out, {2}''{7, choice, 0#ve|1#s} already taken what {2}\
  \ wanted.
CONNIVING.ronin=You have a problem - you just might not know it yet.</p>\
  <p>The battlefield isn''t just about firepower - it''s about control. Anyone can pull a trigger. The\
  \ real game is knowing where to apply pressure, which levers to pull, and whose loyalty to question\
  \ when it matters most. That''s where I excel.</p>\
  <p>I don''t fight fair - I fight to win. Misdirection, alliances, subtlety - all weapons in the\
  \ right hands.</p>\
  <p>I''m not asking for trust. I wouldn''t give it to me either. But if you''re smart - and I think\
  \ you are - you''ll see the value in someone who knows how to work the angles.</p>
CONNIVING.interviewerNote.0=Always scheming. Moves people like pieces, stays three steps out of sight.
CONNIVING.interviewerNote.1=Loyalty means nothing. Lies and betrayal are just tools of the trade.
CONNIVING.interviewerNote.2=Words over weapons. Turns enemies on each other, walks off clean.
CONNIVING.interviewerNote.3=Doesn''t play fair - plays to win. Every alliance is a setup.
CONNIVING.interviewerNote.4=Trusts no one. Lives in the shadows, setting traps only they can see.
CONNIVING.interviewerNote.5=Lies like breathing. By the time truth lands, they''re long gone and richer.
CONTROLLING.label=Controlling
CONTROLLING.description.0={0} doesn''t just like to lead - {2} needs to. Every decision, every plan,\
  \ every battle has to go {6} way, and {2} {7, choice, 0#expect|1#expects} absolute obedience.\
  \ Anything less is just another problem to be dealt with.
CONTROLLING.description.1=To {0}, control isn''t about leadership - it''s about domination. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#micromanage|1#micromanages}, {7, choice, 0#manipulate|1#manipulates}, and\
  \ {7, choice, 0#enforce|1#enforces} {6} will through intimidation or force. If someone steps out\
  \ of line, they''ll regret it.
CONTROLLING.description.2={0} trusts exactly one person to get things done right - {4}self. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#nitpick|1#nitpicks} every detail, {7, choice, 0#override|1#overrides} decisions {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} like, and {7, choice, 0#refuse|1#refuses} to delegate unless {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} no other choice.
CONTROLLING.description.3={0} doesn''t just take charge - {2} {7, choice, 0#demand|1#demands} it.\
  \ Every situation must unfold according to {6} design, and {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} little\
  \ patience for anyone who questions {6} authority.
CONTROLLING.description.4=If {0} isn''t in control, {2} {7, choice, 0#aren''t|1#isn''t} comfortable.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#orchestrate|1#orchestrates} every move, dictates every step, and ensures that\
  \ nothing happens without {6} approval - because, in {6} mind, no one else can be trusted to do it\
  \ right.
CONTROLLING.description.5={0}''s leadership style leaves no room for autonomy. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#scrutinize|1#scrutinizes} every action, {7, choice, 0#correct|1#corrects} every\
  \ mistake before it happens, and {7, choice, 0#exert|1#exerts} {6} will so thoroughly that those\
  \ around {4} rarely get the chance to think for themselves.
CONTROLLING.ronin=You don''t need another warrior - you need someone who knows how to keep things\
  \ together.\
  <p>I''ve seen what happens when commands fall apart - too many voices, too many opinions, and\
  \ suddenly you''ve got chaos instead of a plan. That doesn''t happen when I''m in the mix. I don''t\
  \ ask for control - I take it. I make the calls, keep the unit moving, and make sure everyone does\
  \ their job - no hesitation, no mistakes.</p>\
  <p>Let me in, and you''ll see the difference when every mission runs like clockwork - precise and\
  \ efficient. If someone can''t keep up, I''ll handle it.</p>
CONTROLLING.interviewerNote.0=Must be in charge. Demands obedience - anything else is interference.
CONTROLLING.interviewerNote.1=Leads through domination. Controls through fear, force, or pressure.
CONTROLLING.interviewerNote.2=Trusts no one to do it right. Overrides and nitpicks constantly.
CONTROLLING.interviewerNote.3=Authority is non-negotiable. No tolerance for dissent.
CONTROLLING.interviewerNote.4=Needs full control to function. Dictates every step, permits nothing unsupervised.
CONTROLLING.interviewerNote.5=Smothers autonomy. Others follow not by choice - but by lack of room to do otherwise.
CUTTHROAT.label=Cutthroat
CUTTHROAT.description.0={0} plays to win, and {2} {7, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} care how messy it\
  \ gets. Whether it''s business, politics, or the battlefield, {2} {7, choice, 0#exploit|1#exploits}\

  \ - no matter the cost.
CUTTHROAT.description.1={0} doesn''t believe in fair fights - {2} {7, choice, 0#believe|1#believes}\
  \ in surviving. {1}''ll lie, cheat, betray, and destroy without hesitation, because in {6} world,\
  \ there''s no room for second place. If someone isn''t strong enough to keep up, they don''t deserve\
  \ to be here.
CUTTHROAT.description.2={0} knows that power isn''t given - it''s taken. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#maneuver|1#maneuvers} people like game pieces, striking deals with one hand and\
  \ slipping a dagger in with the other. If there''s an opportunity to get ahead, {2}''ll take it\
  \ before anyone else even sees it coming.
CUTTHROAT.description.3={0} doesn''t waste time on sentiment - {2} {7, choice, 0#do|1#does} what it\
  \ takes to win. Morality, loyalty, and fairness are just obstacles, and {2} {7, choice, 0#have|1#has}\
  \ no patience for those too weak to do what''s necessary.
CUTTHROAT.description.4=In {0}''s world, hesitation is death and kindness is a liability. {1}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#seize|1#seizes} every advantage, {7, choice, 0#eliminate|1#eliminates} threats\
  \ before they become problems, and {7, choice, 0#ensure|1#ensures} that when the dust settles,\
  \ {2}''{7, choice, 0#re|1#s} the only one left standing.
CUTTHROAT.description.5={0} doesn''t believe in rules - only results. {1}''ll step on allies, deceive\
  \ enemies, and manipulate anyone in {6} way, all with a cold efficiency that leaves no room for\
  \ doubt or regret.
CUTTHROAT.ronin=Let''s skip the small talk - you need someone who knows how to win.\
  <p>I''m not interested in playing fair. Fair gets you killed. The battlefield isn''t about honor -\
  \ it''s about survival. If that means cutting corners, breaking deals, or leaving someone behind,\
  \ so be it. You don''t win by being nice - you win by being the last one standing.</p>\
  <p>You need someone who handles the dirty work - someone who makes the hard calls and follows\
  \ through? Let me in, give me the freedom to do what needs to be done, and I''ll make sure you come\
  \ out ahead.</p>
CUTTHROAT.interviewerNote.0=Plays dirty, wins clean. Eliminates threats without blinking - cost is irrelevant.
CUTTHROAT.interviewerNote.1=Fair fights are for fools. Ruthless, deceptive, and deadly efficient.
CUTTHROAT.interviewerNote.2=Takes power, doesn''t ask for it. Strikes fast, betrays faster.
CUTTHROAT.interviewerNote.3=Morals are roadblocks. Victory matters - nothing else.
CUTTHROAT.interviewerNote.4=Sees kindness as weakness. Destroys problems before they form.
CUTTHROAT.interviewerNote.5=Breaks rules, breaks people. Leaves no one behind - unless it benefits them.
DISHONEST.label=Dishonest
DISHONEST.description.0={0} has a slippery relationship with the truth, bending it whenever it\

DISHONEST.description.1={0} lies as easily as {2} breathes. Manipulation, deception, and outright\

  \ carefully crafted facade.
DISHONEST.description.2={0} could sell shorts on an ice world and still walk away with a profit.\
  \ {1} {7, choice, 0#weave|1#weaves} half-truths, {7, choice, 0#dodge|1#dodges} direct answers,\
  \ and always has an excuse ready - because if you can talk your way out of trouble, why bother\
  \ telling the truth?
DISHONEST.description.3={0} treats the truth as optional. If a lie gets {4} what {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#want|1#wants} faster, {2} won''t hesitate to spin a story, twist the facts, or\
  \ leave out just enough details to shift things in {6} favor.
DISHONEST.description.4=Honesty is a tool {0} only uses when it suits {4}. {1} {7, choice, 0#weave|1#weaves}\
  \ deception effortlessly, leaving people second-guessing what''s real and what''s just another one\
  \ of {6} carefully constructed falsehoods.
DISHONEST.description.5={0} never lets the truth get in the way of a good opportunity. Whether\

  \ {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} sure {6} version of reality is the one people believe.
DISHONEST.ronin=You want results? You''re not going to get them by playing it straight.\
  <p>I know how the game works - and more importantly, how to make it work for me. Truth is flexible,\
  \ and people are easier to handle when they believe what you want them to. If a little misdirection\
  \ smooths the path, why not use it?</p>\
  <p>Trust me - or don''t. It doesn''t matter. What matters is that I get the job done. I''ll tell\
  \ people what they need to hear. And when it''s over, you''ll be on top - because I made sure the\
  \ right people believed the right things.</p>\
  <p>What do you say?</p>
DISHONEST.interviewerNote.0=Twists the truth to suit the moment. Promises are made to be broken.

TYRANNICAL.label=Tyrannical
TYRANNICAL.description.0={0} demands absolute control, tolerating no dissent and expecting orders\

  \ from strict discipline, and {2} {7, choice, 0#enfore|1#enforces} it with an iron fist.
TYRANNICAL.description.1={0} doesn''t lead - {2} rules. Fear and obedience are {6} weapons, and {2}\
  \ {7, choice, 0#have|1#has} no patience for weakness. Those who resist {4} are crushed, those who\

TYRANNICAL.ronin=Let''s get one thing straight - I''m not asking to join your unit. I''m offering you\

  <p>I''ve seen what happens when leadership gets soft - hesitation, compromise, and eventual collapse.\
  \ I don''t let that happen. I take control. I keep order. I don''t tolerate insubordination. When I\

  \ have the stomach to do what it takes to win. I''ve done things that would make most people flinch\
  \ - and I''ll do them again if it gets results.\
  <p>That''s why you need me. You''ve got a unit full of warriors trying to fight clean while the\
  \ universe plays dirty. You need someone who isn''t afraid to cut corners, twist arms, and break\
