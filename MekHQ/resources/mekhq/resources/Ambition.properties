CALCULATING.label=Calculating
CALCULATING.description.0={0} never acts on impulse - every move {2} {7, choice, 0#make|1#makes} is\

CALCULATING.description.4=Nothing {0} does is by chance - {2} {7, choice, 0#play|1#plays} the long\

CONTROLLING.label=Controlling
CONTROLLING.description.0={0} doesn't just like to lead - {2} needs to. Every decision, every plan,\
