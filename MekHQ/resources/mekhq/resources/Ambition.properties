  \ playing catch-up, whether they realize it or not.
ARROGANT.description.1={0} doesn't just look down on others - {2} barely acknowledges them. {1} sees\

  \ someone disagrees with {4}, it's because they're too stupid to understand why {2}'s right.
ARROGANT.description.2={0} never doubts {4}self, even when {2} absolutely should. {1} struts into\

  \ {4}, {2} refuses to stop striving for the future {2} knows {2} can reach.

CALCULATING.label=Calculating
CALCULATING.description.0={0} never acts on impulse - every move {2} makes is carefully thought out,\
  \ every action weighed against its potential outcome. Whether in battle or negotiations, {2} plays\
  \ the long game, ensuring {2} always comes out ahead.
CALCULATING.description.1={0} doesn't care about honor, mercy, or sentiment - only results. {1}\

  \ liabilities. If a sacrifice needs to be made, {2} won't hesitate to pull the trigger.
CALCULATING.description.2={0} isn't interested in quick victories - {2}'s interested in certain\

CONTROLLING.description.0={0} doesn't just like to lead - {2} needs to. Every decision, every plan,\
  \ every battle has to go {6} way, and {2} expects absolute obedience. Anything less is just\
  \ another problem to be dealt with.
CONTROLLING.description.1=To {0}, control isn't about leadership - it's about domination. {1}\
  \ micromanages, manipulates, and enforces {6} will through intimidation or force. If someone\
  \ steps out of line, they'll regret it.
CONTROLLING.description.2={0} trusts exactly one person to get things done right - {4}self. {1}\

DISHONEST.label=Dishonest
DISHONEST.description.0={0} has a slippery relationship with the truth, bending it whenever it\

  \ never intends to keep, {2} always has a way with words.
DISHONEST.description.1={0} lies as easily as {2} breathes. Manipulation, deception, and outright\
  \ betrayal are just tools in {6} arsenal, used to control those too naive to see through {6}\
  \ carefully crafted facade.
DISHONEST.description.2={0} could sell coolant to an ice world and still walk away with a profit.\

  \ just sheer intensity, {2} goes all-in, often pushing beyond what's necessary - or even reasonable.
EXCESSIVE.description.1=Enough is never enough for {0}. {1} overcommits, overkills, and\
  \ overcompensates, whether it's unloading an entire magazine into a crippled enemy or turning a\
  \ simple job into an all-consuming mission. If restraint is a virtue, {0} never learned it.
EXCESSIVE.description.2=Subtlety? Restraint? {0}'s never heard of them. If one missile is good,\

  \ someone thinks they're in control, it's only because {0} wants them to think that.
MANIPULATIVE.description.2={0} doesn't force people to do what {2} wants - {2} makes them want to do\

  \ if it kills {4}.
PERSISTENT.description.2=Once {0} sets {6} sights on something, there's no shaking {4}. {1}'ll\

  \ subordinates don't like it, they can be replaced.

UNAMBITIOUS.label=Unambitious
UNAMBITIOUS.description.0={0} is content with where {2} is. While others scramble for promotions,\
  \ glory, or power, {2} sees no reason to stress - {2} does {6} job, collects {6} pay, and doesn't\
  \ bother chasing dreams that require unnecessary effort.
UNAMBITIOUS.description.1=Once, {0} might have wanted more, but now? {1}'s seen too many people\

  \ for desperation, and {0} has long since stopped caring.
UNAMBITIOUS.description.2={0} doesn't see the point in fighting for a bigger slice of the pie\
  \ when {2}'s already got enough to get by. Others can stress over promotions and prestige - {2}'ll\

UNSCRUPULOUS.label=Unscrupulous
UNSCRUPULOUS.description.0={0} doesn't let rules, ethics, or principles get in the way of what {2}\
