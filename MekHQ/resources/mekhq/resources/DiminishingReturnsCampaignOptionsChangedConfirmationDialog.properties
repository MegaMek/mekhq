DiminishingReturnsCampaignOptionsChangedConfirmationDialog.message=<h1 style="text-align:center">Diminishing \
  Returns</h1>\
  You have just enabled diminishing returns on contract pay in a campaign that previously had it disabled. This \
  campaign option was introduced to help address the issue of infinite growth in MekHQ. Specifically, the tendency \
  for campaign sizes to snowball due to larger campaigns being paid more, allowing spiraling growth.\
  <p>With this option enabled, the value of each unit (when calculating contract pay) is affected by diminishing \
  returns. Diminishing returns start once your <b>combat units</b> exceed two battalions (or factional equivalent) \
  and caps out at 10% around four battalions. That means combat units beyond that will be valued lower than normal. \
  This effectively places a soft cap on campaign size of around one regiment (of combat units, support units are \
  ignored here).\
  <p>While this campaign option was introduced to fix an out-of-game balance issue, it has a basis in lore. Namely, \
  most employers either cannot afford to hire multi-regiment commands or simply don't need them.</p>\
  <p>If you prefer huge campaigns, you may wish to disable this campaign option.</p>
