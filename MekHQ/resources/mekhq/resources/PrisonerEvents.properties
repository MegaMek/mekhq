free.report={0} has been freed.
freeEvent0.message={0}, as ordered, we''ve released prisoners from the overcrowded sections. They\
  \ were processed swiftly, provided minimal supplies for their journey, and escorted beyond the\
  \ perimeter. The remaining prisoners seem calmer, though some voiced frustration about not being\
  \ included in the release.
freeEvent1.message={0}, we''ve freed a group of prisoners deemed least likely to pose a threat. They\
  \ were escorted to the gates and sent on their way with basic provisions. The holding areas are\
  \ less crowded now, and the guards are reporting fewer signs of unrest among the remaining\
  \ population.
freeEvent2.message={0}, the release operation is complete. Twenty-five prisoners were carefully\
  \ selected and processed out of the facility. We ensured they left with no contraband, and the\
  \ transition went smoothly. Morale among the guards has improved, though the population remains\
  \ wary.
freeEvent3.message={0}, a number of prisoners were freed from the holding wing. They were escorted\
  \ to the outer perimeter, and the gates were sealed behind them. The atmosphere in the facility\
  \ has stabilized somewhat, with guards reporting a noticeable reduction in tension.
freeEvent4.message={0}, we successfully freed 18 prisoners, prioritizing those with no history of\
  \ violence. They were released at a secure checkpoint and directed away from the facility. The\
  \ remaining prisoners are subdued, and overcrowding has been significantly reduced.
freeEvent5.message={0}, prisoners have been released per your orders. The operation went smoothly,\
  \ with no incidents during the transfer. The guards are reporting improved conditions in the\
  \ holding areas, and order is being reestablished.
freeEvent6.message={0}, as directed, we''ve released a group of low-risk prisoners. They were\
  \ processed and sent out under supervision. The mood among the guards is improving now that we''ve\
  \ eased the burden, though some prisoners still seem restless.
freeEvent7.message={0}, prisoners were freed from the compound earlier today. The release was\
  \ orderly, and the guards ensured that none of the remaining population attempted to interfere.\
  \ Overcrowding is no longer an issue, and operations have stabilized.
freeEvent8.message={0}, prisoners were released and escorted to the outer perimeter. The operation\
  \ was completed without incident, and the holding cells are now operating within capacity. The\
  \ guards are resuming normal duties, and the remaining prisoners appear less agitated.
freeEvent9.message={0}, the prisoner release has been carried out. Twenty-five individuals were\
  \ processed and released with basic rations. The remaining prisoners are calmer now that the\
  \ overcrowding has been addressed. The guards have returned to their posts, and the situation is\
  \ stable.
freeEvent10.message={0}, per your directive, we''ve released some prisoners. Each individual was\
  \ processed thoroughly, ensuring no contraband or intelligence was removed from the facility.\
  \ They were escorted beyond the perimeter under close supervision. The operation proceeded\
  \ without incident, and the remaining prisoners are subdued for now.
freeEvent11.message={0}, the release of prisoners has been completed. The process went smoother than\
  \ expected, with no resistance from the remaining population. Overcrowding in the cells is no\
  \ longer an issue, and the guards are reporting a much-needed reprieve.
freeEvent12.message={0}, the prisoner release has been carried out. While the operation was\
  \ successful, some of our men expressed frustration at seeing hardened combatants set free.\
  \ Nonetheless, the cells are now at manageable levels, and we remain vigilant for any\
  \ repercussions.
freeEvent13.message={0}, as ordered, some prisoners were released earlier today. The process was\
  \ conducted methodically, ensuring no disruptions. While this decision has relieved pressure on\
  \ the facility, it''s a calculated risk that we''ll monitor closely.
freeEvent14.message={0}, prisoners have been processed and released from custody. The operation was\
  \ completed without complications, and the overcrowding in the holding area has been alleviated.\
  \ Guards are resuming standard operations.
freeEvent15.message={0}, the release of prisoners is complete. Each was escorted out under heavy\
  \ guard, and no incidents occurred during the operation. While this eases the strain on the\
  \ facility, we remain acutely aware of the potential consequences of their return to enemy\
  \ forces.
freeEvent16.message={0}, the transfer of prisoners has been completed successfully. The process went\
  \ according to plan, and the remaining detainees have been compliant since the release. The\
  \ facility is back within capacity, and the guards are reporting improved morale.
freeEvent17.message={0}, we''ve completed the prisoner release. While the immediate overcrowding\
  \ issue has been resolved, some of my men have expressed concern that we may have released\
  \ valuable assets back to the enemy. Nevertheless, the facility is stable for now.
freeEvent18.message={0}, prisoners have been released into enemy custody. While this decision has\
  \ brought relief to the holding areas, it''s clear the remaining population is still watching\
  \ closely. The operation proceeded without incident, but the tension in the air remains palpable.
freeEvent19.message={0}, we''ve released some prisoners as instructed. The process was conducted\
  \ under strict oversight, ensuring compliance from the remaining detainees. We''re maintaining\
  \ heightened vigilance to ensure this release doesn''t embolden the remaining population.
freeEvent20.message={0}, we''ve released some prisoners. Many were barely able to walk, their bodies\
  \ frail from confinement. The look in their eyes spoke volumes - fear, anger, and the haunting\
  \ emptiness of souls broken by captivity. The operation is complete, but the weight of what we''ve\
  \ witnessed remains heavy.
freeEvent21.message={0}, prisoners have been freed. Their gaunt faces and trembling hands were a\
  \ stark reminder of the suffering they''ve endured. Some whispered words of home as they stepped\
  \ out, others said nothing at all. The guards are shaken; this wasn''t an easy task.
freeEvent22.message={0}, we''ve carried out the prisoner release. Their condition is\
  \ harrowing - emaciated, covered in bruises, and barely clinging to what humanity remains. Some\
  \ clutched photographs or trinkets as they shuffled out, shadows of the warriors they once were.
freeEvent23.message={0}, the release of prisoners has been completed. Their state was worse than\
  \ expected - sunken eyes, skeletal frames, and the unmistakable marks of prolonged suffering. Some\
  \ cried as they left, others stared blankly ahead. This is a grim chapter for us all.
freeEvent24.message={0}, prisoners were freed today, though it feels like releasing ghosts. Their\
  \ bodies are wasted, their minds distant. Some guards avoided looking at them directly, ashamed\
  \ of the conditions we allowed to persist. The task is done, but the memory will linger.
freeEvent25.message={0}, we''ve released the prisoners. Their silent, hollow stares told us\
  \ everything we needed to know about their time here. A few clung to each other as they walked\
  \ out, their camaraderie the only thing keeping them from falling apart entirely.
freeEvent26.message={0}, the release of prisoners is complete. The sight of them leaving - many\
  \ limping, others being carried - was gut-wrenching. Their frailty and the haunted looks on their\
  \ faces left no doubt about the toll of captivity. It''s a scene none of us will forget.
freeEvent27.message={0}, as ordered, prisoners were released today. Their gaunt frames and unsteady\
  \ steps were a chilling reminder of what captivity has done to them. Some guards muttered prayers\
  \ as they watched them go, grappling with the horrors we''ve witnessed firsthand.
freeEvent28.message={0}, the release of prisoners has been completed. The holding cells are quieter\
  \ now, but the memory of their suffering hangs heavy. Their skeletal forms and the marks of\
  \ restraint are a testament to the grim reality of war. We''ll carry this burden long after\
  \ they''ve gone.
freeEvent29.message={0}, prisoners were freed today. Their condition was devastating - sunken cheeks,\
  \ scars both old and new, and a silence that seemed louder than any scream. The sight visibly\
  \ shook even my guards. The task is done, but the cost is something we''ll all carry.
freeEvent30.message={0}, the prisoner release was completed, but it wasn''t without incident. Some\
  \ prisoners refused to leave, claiming they had no homes to return to, while others argued\
  \ violently about who deserved freedom. Guards had to intervene multiple times to prevent\
  \ serious altercations.
freeEvent31.message={0}, prisoners were released, but the process descended into chaos. Fights broke\
  \ out among the prisoners as they vied for supplies, and several guards sustained minor injuries\
  \ trying to separate them. Order has been restored, but tensions remain high.
freeEvent32.message={0}, the prisoner release has been carried out, but some prisoners sabotaged\
  \ their cells before leaving, damaging locks and equipment. The release caused an uproar among\
  \ the remaining population, who''re now demanding to know when they will be freed.
freeEvent33.message={0}, as we prepared to release the prisoners, a group of them resisted, accusing\
  \ us of sending them to their deaths. Some of the remaining prisoners joined in the shouting,\
  \ forcing my guards to act swiftly to regain control. The operation continued, but tensions are\
  \ simmering.
freeEvent34.message={0}, prisoners were released today, but the operation nearly collapsed when one\
  \ prisoner attempted to take a guard hostage, claiming they deserved "revenge" for their\
  \ treatment. The guard was unharmed, and the prisoner was restrained, but the mood remains\
  \ hostile.
freeEvent35.message={0}, the prisoner release was delayed when we discovered one of them had\
  \ sabotaged the gate mechanism to prevent the process from moving forward. Repairs took several\
  \ hours, and while the release was eventually completed, the incident has put everyone on edge.
freeEvent36.message={0}, prisoners were released today, but the process was marred by hostility.\
  \ Many hurled insults at the guards, blaming them for the conditions they endured. A few had to\
  \ be forcibly removed from the premises, escalating tensions among those left behind.
freeEvent37.message={0}, prisoners were freed today, but the operation caused a stir among the\
  \ remaining population. Prisoners not chosen for release have begun muttering about favoritism\
  \ and threatening to disrupt future operations. The guards are keeping a close eye on the\
  \ situation.
freeEvent38.message={0}, as we released the prisoners, one collapsed during the final checks,\
  \ claiming severe illness. The guards had to call for medical assistance, delaying the operation\
  \ and causing frustration among the other prisoners. The release was eventually completed, but\
  \ the situation left many guards on edge.
freeEvent39.message={0}, prisoners were released, but the operation turned tense when several of\
  \ them openly declared their intention to rejoin the fight against us. Their defiance unsettled\
  \ my men, and their words riled up the remaining population. While the release was completed, the\
  \ atmosphere in the facility is now significantly more volatile.
freeEvent40.message={0}, during the prisoner release, two rival prisoners shocked everyone by\
  \ shaking hands as they walked out. Their followers cheered, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ abuzz with rumors of an alliance forming outside the facility. The guards are uneasy, as this\
  \ could spell trouble for the future.
freeEvent41.message={0}, as we prepared to release the prisoners, the commotion allowed three others\
  \ to slip past the guards unnoticed. We''ve secured the facility, and the missing prisoners are\
  \ accounted for. This incident has raised questions about security protocols during operations\
  \ like this.
freeEvent42.message={0}, the release of prisoners nearly failed when one of them detonated a hidden\
  \ explosive device just outside the perimeter, damaging the gates and a holding cell. The\
  \ prisoner claimed it was a "farewell gift." While the others left without incident, tensions in\
  \ the facility are high.
freeEvent43.message={0}, during the prisoner release, one of them suddenly collapsed and died before\
  \ they could leave. The cause is unclear, though initial signs point to malnutrition or\
  \ exhaustion. The incident delayed the operation, and the remaining prisoners are spreading\
  \ rumors of foul play.
freeEvent44.message={0}, as they were released, a group of prisoners held up scraps of fabric\
  \ stitched together into their faction''s banner, chanting slogans of defiance. The display\
  \ enraged some of the remaining prisoners, leading to scuffles in the holding area. Guards\
  \ intervened to prevent further escalation.
freeEvent45.message={0}, prisoners were released, but not before conducting an eerie ritual in the\
  \ holding area. They marked their faces with soot, spoke in hushed chants, and vowed revenge\
  \ before leaving. My guards are deeply unsettled, and the remaining prisoners are whispering\
  \ about what the ritual meant.
freeEvent46.message={0}, during the prisoner release, guards discovered that two individuals\
  \ attempting to leave weren''t on the release list. They had swapped identification with others\
  \ in the cells. The imposters were detained, but the real prisoners meant for release remain\
  \ unaccounted for, and we''re conducting a headcount to determine their whereabouts
freeEvent47.message={0}, prisoners were released, but one left behind a chilling message scrawled on\
  \ the wall of their cell: "We''ll meet again in the ashes." The guards are rattled, and the\
  \ remaining prisoners seem energized by the act. The situation in the holding area is growing\
  \ tense.
freeEvent48.message={0}, during the release, one guard was found attempting to leave disguised as a\
  \ detainee. When questioned, they confessed to trying to desert under the guise of the operation.\
  \ The situation was handled discreetly, but the remaining guards are questioning their loyalty to\
  \ the mission.
freeEvent49.message={0}, prisoners were freed today, but the operation took an emotional turn when\
  \ one of them spotted a guard they recognized from a past battle. Tensions flared, and the two\
  \ nearly came to blows before the situation was de-escalated. The release was completed, but the\
  \ incident has left both parties visibly shaken.

executeEvent0.message={0}, the prisoners have been executed as per your orders. We isolated them in\
  \ the eastern storage hangar to ensure no civilians or non-essential personnel were present. Each\
  \ was dealt with quickly and efficiently, minimizing unnecessary commotion.
executeEvent1.message=<p>{0}, the task is done, but I''ll be honest - I didn''t sign up for this. These\
  \ were just warriors who surrendered when the odds turned. Some of them begged. I kept it\
  \ clean, no unnecessary pain, but this sits heavy.</p>\
  <p>The team''s quiet now. Nobody''s saying much, but I can see it on their faces. If this is the\
  \ new norm for our outfit, we might need to start asking ourselves who we''re becoming.</p>
executeEvent2.message={0}, the prisoners have been eliminated as instructed. Execution took place in\
  \ the quarry, far from camp, ensuring no witnesses or disruptions. Disposal is handled; no\
  \ evidence remains.
executeEvent3.message=<p>{0}, prisoners are no longer an issue. Execution was carried out in a\
  \ controlled manner behind the east perimeter. No complications arose, and the cleanup team has\
  \ finished their part.</p>\
  <p>Recommend avoiding this site for at least 48 hours while residual traces are dealt with.\
  \ Moving forward, it might be worth considering alternative methods to minimize resource use.</p>
executeEvent4.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I don''t like it, but it''s done. You should know some of\
  \ these folks weren''t even combatants anymore - they barely put up a fight. But hey, I''m\
  \ sure your spreadsheets say it makes sense to treat prisoners like liabilities.</p>\
  <p>If this is where we''re headed as a company, I need to think about whether I belong here.</p>
executeEvent5.message={0}, the prisoners have been executed as per your directive. I ensured it was\
  \ handled as cleanly and professionally as possible. That said, I feel it''s my duty to express\
  \ concern over the potential fallout of such actions. News travels fast, and this could harm our\
  \ reputation with future employers.
executeEvent6.message={0}, prisoners are taken care of. No mess, no fuss. One of them tried to talk\
  \ their way out, but we shut that down fast. No loose ends to worry about.
executeEvent7.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners were dealt with, as you ordered. I carried out the task\
  \ personally, ensuring there was no unnecessary suffering. I''ll be blunt - I don''t know how the\
  \ team will respond to this long-term. Morale''s already shaky, and this sort of thing has a way\
  \ of sticking with people.</p>\
  <p>I suggest we give the squad some downtime to process. I''ll do what I can to keep things\
  \ steady.</p>
executeEvent8.message={0}, the prisoners are no longer a factor. I understand there may be\
  \ criticism, but let''s be clear: they were a security risk. Even under guard, we couldn''t\
  \ guarantee they wouldn''t escape or sabotage our operations.
executeEvent9.message={0}, prisoners are handled. Nothing fancy, nothing drawn out - they''re gone. Let\
  \ me know if there''s anything else you need cleaned up.
executeEvent10.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I can''t say I feel good about it, but I don''t suppose that\
  \ matters. They were defeated, powerless - part of me wonders what we achieve by killing men who''ve\
  \ already lost.</p>\
  <p>Still, I followed through because that''s what you expect. Orders are orders, and I''m here to\
  \ do the job. I just hope this isn''t the kind of thing that defines us moving forward.</p>
executeEvent11.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners have been dealt with, but we encountered complications.\
  \ Two of them overpowered a guard and tried to escape before the execution. We neutralized them,\
  \ but one of our people took a knife to the leg. The rest were executed without further\
  \ incident.</p>\
  <p>Recommend reviewing security procedures to avoid future disruptions. Let me know if you need a\
  \ full report.</p>
executeEvent12.message={0}, we carried out the execution as ordered, but I''ve just received\
  \ confirmation that one of the prisoners was an allied operative. Their credentials didn''t check\
  \ out during processing. I take full responsibility for the oversight and await your instructions\
  \ on handling the fallout.
executeEvent13.message={0}, the task is complete, but there''s a problem. Civilians from a nearby\
  \ settlement stumbled onto the site just after we began. They saw too much before we could\
  \ disperse them. If they decide to talk, this could blow back on us hard.
executeEvent14.message={0}, execution of the prisoners is done, but there were complications with\
  \ the team. One guard refused to participate outright and has since isolated himself from the\
  \ unit. Another is showing signs of severe distress. The task weighed heavily on all of us.
executeEvent15.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners sabotaged their holding area before we moved them for\
  \ execution. They jammed the gate mechanism and damaged some of the restraints. It delayed the\
  \ operation by several hours, and we had to subdue them with stun rounds before proceeding.</p>\
  <p>The task is now complete, but it wasn''t clean. I''ll include a report on the equipment damage\
  \ for review.</p>
executeEvent16.message={0}, we began the execution as ordered, but conflicting instructions from\
  \ central command reached us mid-task, demanding the prisoners be kept alive for questioning. Two\
  \ were already dealt with before the halt. The remaining three have been restrained and returned\
  \ to holding.
executeEvent17.message={0}, the execution turned chaotic. While en route to the site, one of the\
  \ prisoners triggered a concealed explosive device during a struggle. Two guards were lightly\
  \ injured, and three prisoners were killed in the blast. The remaining two were executed\
  \ afterward, but the incident could draw unwanted attention.
executeEvent18.message=<p>{0}, we encountered complications at the execution site. Sudden\
  \ bad weather forced us to abandon the operation mid-task. The high winds made\
  \ it unsafe to proceed, and transporting the prisoners back to base was risky, but they''re\
  \ secured in the auxiliary bunker for now.</p>\
  <p>Once the storm clears, we''ll carry out your orders.</p>
executeEvent19.message=<p>{0}, the execution order was carried out, but it didn''t go smoothly. One\
  \ of the prisoners incited the others to attack while being moved to the site. They managed to\
  \ lightly injure a guard and nearly succeeded in overpowering another. The mutiny was suppressed,\
  \ but it forced us to execute them on the spot instead of the planned location.</p>\
  <p>The situation is contained, and cleanup is underway. We''ll double-check procedures to prevent\
  \ another incident.</p>
executeEvent20.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I can''t shake the sound they made, though - the pleading,\
  \ the sobbing. They knew what was coming, and that''s what makes this so much worse. These weren''t\
  \ combatants anymore. They were just... people.</p>\
  <p>We did what you asked, but I''ll tell you this: some things don''t wash off, no matter how many\
  \ orders you follow.</p>
executeEvent21.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners are gone, but I can''t stop thinking about the way they\
  \ looked at me. Not angry or defiant - just scared. One of them even said thank you when I offered\
  \ them water before the end. I keep asking myself if that was mercy or cruelty.</p>\
  <p>I don''t know how to forget their faces.</p>
executeEvent22.message=<p>{0}, the order has been carried out, but there was a problem. One of my\
  \ men refused to follow through. He broke down during the task, crying and shaking. I had to\
  \ finish their part myself. I''ll handle discipline on my end, but... I think they''re shattered.\
  \ This kind of thing breaks people.</p>\
  <p>Recommend pulling him from active duty for now.</p>
executeEvent23.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners begged. They begged right up until the end. I didn''t\
  \ want to listen, but it''s impossible to block out. One of them swore they''d do anything if we\
  \ let them go - offered us intel, even credits. I carried out the task because I know the price of\
  \ disobedience.</p>\
  <p>But their voices keep echoing in my head. I did the job, but what kind of people does this\
  \ make us?</p>
executeEvent24.message=<p>{0}, the job is done. It''s quiet here now - too quiet. No one on the team is\
  \ speaking, not even the usual chatter on comms. You can feel it hanging in the air, the weight\
  \ of what we just did.</p>\
  <p>I know this is part of the business, but today, it feels like we crossed a line that we can''t\
  \ uncross.</p>
executeEvent25.message=<p>{0}, the last prisoner was unarmed, kneeling, and crying. They didn''t even\
  \ resist, just asked to see their family one last time. I... I made sure it was quick, but it\
  \ didn''t feel like mercy. It felt like murder.</p>\
  <p>I know we have reasons for this, but it''s starting to feel like we''re no better than the\
  \ people we''re fighting.</p>
executeEvent26.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. The bodies have been disposed of, but the team is falling\
  \ apart. Two guards are talking about leaving the company, saying they can''t handle this kind of\
  \ work. Another hasn''t said a word since it happened.</p>\
  <p>If we keep giving orders like this, we''ll lose more than just soldiers - we''ll lose our\
  \ humanity.</p>
executeEvent27.message=<p>{0}, one of the prisoners asked if they could pray before we executed\
  \ them. I allowed it, thinking it might bring them peace. Instead, it tore the team apart\
  \ emotionally. Some of us couldn''t look away. One guard even started crying.</p>\
  <p>The task was completed, but it left us all shaken. This isn''t just killing enemies - it''s\
  \ killing hope.</p>
executeEvent28.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners are gone. Their last words won''t leave me. One cursed\
  \ us, one begged, and another just kept saying, "It''s not fair." I thought I was hardened to this\
  \ kind of thing, but something about this order feels... wrong.</p>\
  <p>We carried it out because that''s what we do, but I don''t know how much more of this the\
  \ team - or I - can take.</p>
executeEvent29.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. I followed through personally, just like you asked. I\
  \ washed my hands afterward, but I can still feel the blood. It doesn''t matter how many times I\
  \ tell myself they were enemies - there''s something deeply wrong about killing people who can''t\
  \ fight back.</p>\
  <p>I don''t know if I''m the person you think I am, but I''ll keep trying to be.</p>
executeEvent30.message=<p>{0}, it''s over, but the walk back felt endless. None of us said a word.\
  \ The prisoners were crying, shouting, some just staring, resigned. When it was done, all I could\
  \ hear was the wind.</p>\
  <p>I know we''ve done worse things in combat, but this feels different. It wasn''t war - it was\
  \ slaughter. The guards under my command will follow orders, but today I think we lost a piece of\
  \ ourselves.</p>\
  <p>I''ll follow your lead, as always, but I had to tell you what this cost us.</p>
executeEvent31.message={0}, it''s done, but the screams won''t stop. They didn''t go quietly. Some\
  \ of them cried for their families, others screamed until their voices broke. Even when it was\
  \ over, the echoes felt louder than the gunshots.
executeEvent32.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. One of them asked if their mother would find out what\
  \ happened to them. I told them no. I lied. Then I pulled the trigger.</p>\
  <p>Whatever these orders accomplish, I hope you''re ready to live with them. Because I''m not sure\
  \ if I can.</p>
executeEvent33.message=<p>{0}, it''s done, but not without incident. Half the team refused to go\
  \ through with it, and the others forced them aside to finish the job. There was shouting,\
  \ cursing, even a fistfight before it was over. These weren''t soldiers - it was like watching\
  \ animals tear each other apart.</p>\
  <p>I''m not sure if the team will ever recover from this. Maybe none of us will.</p>
executeEvent34.message=<p>{0}, they knew what was coming before we even lined them up. Some tried to\
  \ joke, saying, "Make it quick." Others just knelt, trembling, as if they were already dead. The\
  \ worst part was the silence afterward, the sound of boots on blood-soaked ground.</p>\
  <p>We followed orders, but it felt like a massacre.</p>
executeEvent35.message=<p>{0}, one of my men broke down halfway through, sobbing as they pulled the\
  \ trigger. I had to step in and finish their part. Now they''re curled up in a corner of the\
  \ barracks, shaking like a child.</p>\
  <p>You can give us orders, but you can''t make us forget what we''ve done.</p>
executeEvent36.message=<p>{0}, one of the prisoners offered me everything - credits, intel, even their\
  \ own house - if I spared them. They were shaking so hard they could barely speak. I carried out\
  \ your orders anyway, but I''ll never forget the way their voice cracked as they begged.</p>\
  <p>Whatever we gained today, it wasn''t worth this.</p>
executeEvent37.message=<p>{0}, it''s done, but I''ll never forget the way they looked at me in those\
  \ final moments. Not hatred, not defiance - just confusion. Like they couldn''t believe we were the\
  \ ones doing this to them.</p>\
  <p>I keep asking myself: when we became monsters?</p>
executeEvent38.message=<p>{0}, the execution site was a horror show. We dug a trench and lined them\
  \ up. When it was over, we had to push the bodies into the pit with a loader. The stench, the\
  \ blood - it''s burned into my senses.</p>
executeEvent39.message=<p>{0}, one of the prisoners started singing. It was a slow, mournful\
  \ song - something about home. The others joined in, even as we raised our weapons. The sound\
  \ didn''t stop until the last one fell.</p>\
  <p>I''ve never heard anything so beautiful, and I hope I never do again.</p>
executeEvent40.message=<p>{0}, it''s done, but I have to ask: what do we tell ourselves to justify\
  \ this? That they were enemies? That they would''ve done the same to us? I''ve killed men on the\
  \ battlefield, but this wasn''t war. This was slaughter, plain and simple.</p>\
  <p>The blood''s on my hands now, but I hope it haunts you too.</p>
executeEvent41.message=<p>{0}, we moved the prisoners to the site as ordered, but the conditions\
  \ were brutal. The march was longer than expected, and we had no water to spare. When some\
  \ collapsed, the guards shot them on the spot to keep the others moving.</p>\
  <p>By the time we reached the site, half were dead already. The ones who made it didn''t even\
  \ resist - they were too weak. This wasn''t an execution. It was slow, grinding death.</p>
executeEvent42.message=<p>{0}, the task is complete. We took the prisoners into the forest, one by\
  \ one, and finished it there. I thought this would feel efficient, but instead, it was drawn out\
  \ and sickening. Each one realized what was happening when the sound of gunfire reached them.</p>\
  <p>The bodies are buried, but the stench lingers. We''ve buried more than people today. We''ve\
  \ buried our humanity.
executeEvent43.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners were executed, but the guards got carried away.\
  \ Civilians who were suspected of aiding them - women, children, the elderly - were rounded up as\
  \ well. By the time I realized what was happening, our firing squads were already at work.</p>\
  <p>This was chaos. There was no justice here, just blood. I''ll submit a report, but I don''t\
  \ know if we can clean this one up.</p>
executeEvent44.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners are dead, but this wasn''t an execution - it was a\
  \ massacre. Some of the guards recognized them as the ones who ambushed our supply convoy last\
  \ month. They didn''t wait for an order - they started shooting, laughing, and kicking the bodies\
  \ when it was over.</p>\
  <p>I tried to restore discipline, but it was too late. This was about vengeance, not orders.</p>
executeEvent45.message=<p>{0}, the prisoners were executed, but some of the guards took it too far.\
  \ Before the task was complete, they... I won''t put the details in writing, but what happened\
  \ before their deaths was nothing short of barbaric.</p>\
  <p>If this comes to light, it won''t just destroy the company''s reputation - it''ll destroy us.</p>
executeEvent46.message=<p>{0}, by the time we reached the prisoners, they were too weak to stand.\
  \ Whoever was supposed to feed them failed, and they hadn''t eaten in days. Most of them were\
  \ delirious, begging for water, food, anything.</p>\
  <p>We carried out the execution anyway, but this wasn''t punishment - it was a mercy killing. What''s\
  \ the point of this?</p>
executeEvent47.message=<p>{0}, the executions took hours. We lined them up in groups, forced them to\
  \ kneel, and shot them one at a time. By the end, one of the guards dropped their weapon and\
  \ started screaming. Another tried to run into the forest to escape the sight of it all.</p>\
  <p>The rest of us finished the job, but I''m not sure any of us will ever come back from this.</p>
executeEvent48.message=<p>{0}, it''s done. We didn''t just execute them; we erased them. No records,\
  \ no graves, no witnesses. It''s as if they never existed.</p>\
  <p>My men are shaken. Some of them whispered about what happens when our turn comes - when we''re\
  \ deemed expendable, too.</p>
executeEvent49.message=<p>{0}, your instructions to delay the execution for "psychological impact"\
  \ worked too well. The prisoners were made to dig their own graves, standing by as we pretended\
  \ to debate their fate. Some collapsed, crying, begging. One tried to throw themselves on our\
  \ rifles to end it early.</p>\
  <p>When we finally carried it out, it wasn''t just them who broke. Two guards started shaking so\
  \ badly they couldn''t hold their weapons, and another swore they''d never take another order like\
  \ this again. We followed through, but at a cost, I''m not sure if this team will survive.</p>
# MINOR
event.ARGUMENT.message={0}, we''ve just had an incident in the holding area. Two groups of\
  \ prisoners got into a heated argument - seems to be over some kind of personal grudge. We\
  \ managed to break it up before it got physical, but tensions are still high. Recommend increased\
  \ patrols in that sector and monitoring for any signs of further conflict. Awaiting further\
  \ instructions.
response.0.ARGUMENT.button=Issue a stern warning that insubordination won''t be tolerated.
response.0.ARGUMENT.success={0}, the stern warning had the desired effect. The prisoners backed\
  \ down, and tensions in the holding area have eased. While there are still some mutterings of\
  \ discontent, the groups appear unwilling to escalate further. Order has been maintained for now.
response.0.ARGUMENT.failure={0}, the warning backfired. Rather than quelling the conflict, it only\
  \ seemed to provoke both groups further. They''ve grown defiant, blaming the guards for taking\
  \ sides. The situation in the holding area is more volatile than ever, and the guards are\
  \ struggling to maintain control.
response.1.ARGUMENT.button=Assign different holding areas to prevent further conflict.
response.1.ARGUMENT.success={0}, the groups have been assigned to separate holding areas, and the\
  \ move has successfully defused the immediate tension. Guards report that both groups are settling\
  \ down now that they''re no longer in close proximity. The situation appears stable.
response.1.ARGUMENT.failure={0}, separating the groups hasn''t resolved the issue. Instead, both\
  \ are using the distance to spread rumors and rally their allies. Guards report an increase in\
  \ hostilities, with tensions spilling into other areas of the facility. Containment is becoming\
  \ a challenge.
response.2.ARGUMENT.button=Avoid intervening. Sometimes enemies need to settle things themselves.
response.2.ARGUMENT.success={0}, the decision to let them handle their dispute on their own seems\
  \ to have worked. The groups appear to have reached an uneasy truce without further intervention.\
  \ Guards report that the situation has calmed down, and the holding area is returning to normal.
response.2.ARGUMENT.failure={0}, letting the groups work it out was a mistake. The argument\
  \ reignited and quickly escalated into a physical brawl, forcing guards to intervene. Several\
  \ prisoners and one guard sustained injuries in the chaos. The situation has been brought under\
  \ control, but the damage is done.
event.WILD_STORIES.message={0}, we''ve got an unusual situation in the holding area. One of the\
  \ prisoners has been keeping the others entertained with wild stories about daring escapes and\
  \ beating impossible odds. The guards overheard a few prisoners joking about trying their\
  \ "techniques." It might just be harmless talk, but it''s worth keeping an eye on them and their\
  \ audience. Suggest we step up vigilance and maybe isolate them if things escalate. Your call.
response.0.WILD_STORIES.button=Let them enjoy their stories. A little morale boost for the\
  \ prisoners might keep them calmer.
response.0.WILD_STORIES.success={0}, allowing the prisoners to enjoy the stories seems to have had\
  \ a positive effect. The mood in the holding area has improved, and the prisoners appear more\
  \ relaxed. Guards report no signs of the stories being taken seriously as escape plans, and\
  \ tensions are low.
response.0.WILD_STORIES.failure={0}, letting the stories continue backfired. The prisoners became\
  \ emboldened, treating the tales as inspiration rather than entertainment. Guards have overheard\
  \ more serious conversations about escape attempts, and tensions are rising in the holding area.
response.1.WILD_STORIES.button=Order the guards to interrupt the story sessions. No need to\
  \ encourage bad ideas.
response.1.WILD_STORIES.success={0}, the guards put a stop to the story sessions, and the\
  \ ringleader has been warned to keep quiet. While some prisoners grumbled, the disruption has\
  \ prevented the stories from gaining any further traction. The situation in the holding area has\
  \ stabilized.
response.1.WILD_STORIES.failure={0}, shutting down the stories sparked backlash among the\
  \ prisoners. They''re accusing the guards of trying to crush any small semblance of morale. The\
  \ ringleader is now stirring up resentment against the staff, and the mood in the holding area is\
  \ more volatile.
response.2.WILD_STORIES.button=Have your guards take note of the tales - there might be useful\
  \ intel hidden in his words.
response.2.WILD_STORIES.success={0}, the guards carefully monitored the story sessions and noted\
  \ several key details. While most of it was harmless fiction, one tale revealed a potential weak\
  \ point in the facility''s security that could have been exploited. The issue has been addressed,\
  \ and the holding area remains secure.
response.2.WILD_STORIES.failure={0}, listening in didn''t yield useful intel, but it did let the\
  \ stories continue unchecked. The prisoners are starting to view the storyteller as a leader, and\
  \ his audience has grown. Guards are reporting a subtle shift in the holding area''s dynamics,\
  \ and there''s concern it could lead to trouble.
event.TAMPERING.message={0}, we caught a prisoner tampering with a vent in the holding cells. The\
  \ breach has been patched, but the prisoner insists it was "just for better air circulation." It\
  \ doesn''t add up, and we suspect they might''ve been testing security or planning something\
  \ more. Recommend reviewing footage and increasing patrols in the area. Let me know if we should\
  \ isolate or interrogate the prisoner further.
response.0.TAMPERING.button=Punish the prisoner harshly to deter further attempts.
response.0.TAMPERING.success={0}, the prisoner was punished harshly, and the display of authority\
  \ has deterred further tampering. Guards report that the other prisoners seem intimidated, and\
  \ there have been no signs of additional security breaches. The situation appears to be under\
  \ control.
response.0.TAMPERING.failure={0}, punishing the prisoner harshly backfired. The rest of the\
  \ population viewed it as excessive, sparking outrage and minor disturbances in the holding area.\
  \ While the tampering has stopped, tensions are running high, and the guards are on edge.
response.1.TAMPERING.button=Quarantine the prisoner as a precaution.
response.1.TAMPERING.success={0}, the prisoner was moved to solitary confinement, and the holding\
  \ area has settled down. Guards report that removing him has lowered the risk of coordinated\
  \ tampering, and no further incidents have been observed. The facility is stable for now.
response.1.TAMPERING.failure={0}, moving the prisoner to solitary has only fueled rumors among the\
  \ population. Many believe he was punished unfairly, and whispers of unrest are spreading. Guards\
  \ are reporting increased hostility from the other prisoners, and tensions are rising.
response.2.TAMPERING.button=There''s no harm done - this time.
response.2.TAMPERING.success={0}, the decision to let the incident slide has de-escalated the\
  \ situation. The prisoner has returned to their cell without further issue, and the holding area\
  \ is calm. Guards are keeping a close watch, but so far, there''s no indication of additional\
  \ tampering.
response.2.TAMPERING.failure={0}, letting the prisoner off the hook has emboldened the population.\
  \ Guards are reporting more frequent tampering attempts, and the holding area has grown more\
  \ chaotic. It''s clear the prisoners view the lack of consequences as a sign of weakness.
event.CONVERSATIONS.message={0}, my men have reported overhearing strange conversations among the\
  \ prisoners. One of them seems to be passing coded messages to others - nothing explicit, but\
  \ it''s clear they''re trying to keep it under the radar. We haven''t cracked what they''re\
  \ saying yet, but it might be worth isolating the suspected messenger and monitoring closely.\
  \ Advise on next steps.
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.button=Assign a guard to decipher the code and gather intelligence.
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.success={0}, the guard assigned to monitor the conversations successfully\
  \ cracked the code. It appears the prisoners were attempting to coordinate a minor disruption,\
  \ but the plot was uncovered before it could be executed. The suspected prisoners have been\
  \ isolated, and the facility remains secure.
response.0.CONVERSATIONS.failure={0}, the attempt to monitor the prisoners failed. The coded\
  \ messages were too cryptic to decipher in time, and it''s clear the prisoners have become more\
  \ cautious. Guards are now reporting increased coordination among the population, indicating a\
  \ potential larger scheme.
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.button=Confront the suspected prisoner directly.
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.success={0}, the interrogation revealed the ringleader''s plans. They\
  \ admitted to attempting to organize a coordinated effort to disrupt the guards but folded under\
  \ pressure. The operation was dismantled, and the ringleader has been isolated. Order has been\
  \ restored in the holding area.
response.1.CONVERSATIONS.failure={0}, the interrogation yielded no useful information. The\
  \ ringleader refused to cooperate, and their defiance has only emboldened the other prisoners.\
  \ Guards report an uptick in suspicious behavior, and tensions in the holding area are rising.
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.button=The guards are stretched thin - focus on bigger problems.
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.success={0}, ignoring the coded conversations seems to have been the right\
  \ call. Guards report no unusual behavior since, and the suspected ringleader has not attempted\
  \ further communication. The situation appears stable, and the holding area is calm for now.
response.2.CONVERSATIONS.failure={0}, ignoring the situation was a mistake. The prisoners used the\
  \ opportunity to coordinate more effectively, and guards are now reporting suspicious activity\
  \ across multiple sections of the facility. Whatever they were planning has likely escalated.
event.RATIONS.message={0}, we''ve got a situation with the prisoners complaining about the rations,\
  \ saying they''re insufficient. A handful of them have refused to eat and are demanding changes\
  \ before they cooperate. So far, it''s contained, but this could escalate if more prisoners join\
  \ in. Requesting guidance on how to proceed - do we negotiate, enforce compliance, or handle this\
  \ another way?
response.0.RATIONS.button=Give them extra rations. Better-fed prisoners are less likely to cause problems.
response.0.RATIONS.success={0}, providing extra rations successfully defused the situation. The\
  \ prisoners are visibly calmer, and guards report that even the most vocal protestors have\
  \ resumed eating. While this approach taxed the supply line slightly, it has restored order in\
  \ the holding area.
response.0.RATIONS.failure={0}, the decision to provide extra rations backfired. The prisoners took\
  \ it as a sign of weakness, and now even more are making demands. Guards are struggling to\
  \ maintain control as the holding area grows increasingly restless.
response.1.RATIONS.button=Rations are fine as they are. They''ll eat when they''re hungry enough.
response.1.RATIONS.success={0}, sticking to the established rations worked as intended. The\
  \ protesting prisoners have begun eating again, realizing their demands wouldn''t be met.\
  \ Guards report that tensions have eased, and the situation is back under control.
response.1.RATIONS.failure={0}, refusing to adjust the rations has escalated the conflict. More\
  \ prisoners are joining the protest, and several have started inciting unrest among the\
  \ population. Guards are reporting increased hostility, and the holding area is becoming\
  \ volatile.
response.2.RATIONS.button=Check with your quartermaster - are the prisoners being shorted?
response.2.RATIONS.success={0}, the investigation revealed that an issue in the supply chain was\
  \ indeed shorting the prisoners'' rations. Once corrected, the prisoners calmed down, and the\
  \ protest ended peacefully. The guards are now monitoring distribution to ensure this doesn''t\
  \ happen again.
response.2.RATIONS.failure={0}, the investigation revealed no discrepancies in the supply line, but\
  \ the delay in addressing the situation emboldened the prisoners. Guards report that tensions have\
  \ escalated, and the protest has spread to a larger portion of the population.
event.TRADE.message={0}, we''ve uncovered a growing contraband trade among the prisoners. They''re\
  \ exchanging messages, trinkets, and even scraps of clothing. So far, it looks harmless, but\
  \ the scale is increasing, and we''re concerned it might lead to something bigger. Recommend\
  \ stepping up inspections and confiscating the items before it becomes a larger security risk.\
  \ Awaiting your instructions.
response.0.TRADE.button=Shut the operation down and punish the traders.
response.0.TRADE.success={0}, the guards conducted a sweep of the holding area, confiscating all\
  \ contraband and punishing those involved in the trade. The operation sent a clear message, and\
  \ the prisoners seem deterred from further attempts. The holding area is secure, and order has\
  \ been restored.
response.0.TRADE.failure={0}, confiscating the contraband caused an uproar among the prisoners.\
  \ They viewed the operation as excessive and retaliated by organizing protests and refusing to \
  cooperate. Guards are reporting increased hostility, and tensions in the holding area are at a\
  \ breaking point.
response.1.TRADE.button=Small trades keep them occupied and less likely to start trouble.
response.1.TRADE.success={0}, allowing the small trades to continue has kept the prisoners occupied\
  \ and relatively peaceful. Guards report no signs of escalation, and the contraband trade appears\
  \ to be more of a distraction than a threat. The holding area remains stable for now.
response.1.TRADE.failure={0}, ignoring the contraband trade backfired. The operation grew larger\
  \ and more organized, eventually leading to the discovery of weapons and tools that could pose a\
  \ serious security threat. The guards are now scrambling to contain the fallout from this\
  \ oversight.
response.2.TRADE.button=Assign guards to oversee and profit from the contraband trade.
response.2.TRADE.success={0}, assigning guards to oversee the contraband trade allowed us to keep\
  \ the operation contained and under control. The prisoners are satisfied with their ability to\
  \ trade, and the guards are using the oversight to gather intelligence. The holding area is calm,\
  \ and no security risks have emerged.
response.2.TRADE.failure={0}, attempting to control the contraband market backfired. The guards''\
  \ involvement was discovered, leading to accusations of corruption from both prisoners and staff.\
  \ The resulting unrest has destabilized the holding area, and trust in our authority is eroding.
event.DRAINED.message={0}, one of my guards has reported feeling drained after extended shifts\
  \ managing the prisoners, particularly with the recent uptick in unruly behavior. Morale across\
  \ the security team seems to be slipping - some of the others are showing signs of frustration as\
  \ well. We may need to adjust the rotation schedule or provide some kind of support to prevent\
  \ burnout. Requesting guidance on how to proceed.
response.0.DRAINED.button=Reassign guards temporarily to less stressful duties.
response.0.DRAINED.success={0}, reassigning guards to less stressful duties has worked wonders for\
  \ morale. The team appears more rested and capable of handling the challenges in the holding\
  \ area. The improved rotation schedule has restored order among the staff without compromising\
  \ security.
response.0.DRAINED.failure={0}, reassigning guards caused a staffing shortage in critical areas. The\
  \ reduced presence in the holding area emboldened the prisoners, and guards report an increase in\
  \ unruly behavior. Morale among the remaining staff has only worsened under the added pressure.
response.1.DRAINED.button=Provide extra incentives, meals, or small comforts to improve morale.
response.1.DRAINED.success={0}, providing incentives like additional rest periods, better meals,\
  \ and small bonuses has revitalized the security team. The guards feel recognized for their\
  \ efforts, and morale has improved significantly. With spirits lifted, discipline has been\
  \ restored in the holding area.
response.1.DRAINED.failure={0}, the attempt to boost morale failed. The incentives were seen as too\
  \ little, too late, and some guards felt insulted by the gesture. Frustration continues to mount,\
  \ and discipline is slipping further. The holding area is becoming more volatile as the security\
  \ team struggles to stay focused.
response.2.DRAINED.button=Toughen them up. Remind your team that discipline is part of the job.
response.2.DRAINED.success={0}, a firm reminder about discipline and duty has strengthened the\
  \ guards'' resolve. While the workload remains heavy, the team has stepped up to the challenge\
  \ and regained control of the holding area. Morale is holding steady, and order has been\
  \ maintained.
response.2.DRAINED.failure={0}, pushing the guards harder backfired. The team is now visibly\
  \ exhausted, and several guards have voiced resentment about the lack of support. Morale has\
  \ deteriorated further, and the risk of errors in the holding area is increasing rapidly.
event.RESCUE.message={0}, a prisoner is stirring up trouble in the holding area. They''ve been\
  \ loudly proclaiming that their "rescue is imminent," and it''s starting to catch the attention\
  \ of other prisoners. I''m concerned his defiance might inspire further unrest if we don''t\
  \ address it quickly. Recommend isolating him or taking measures to shut this down before it\
  \ escalates. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.RESCUE.button=Put the officer in solitary confinement to quiet his voice.
response.0.RESCUE.success={0}, the prisoner was moved to solitary confinement, cutting off his\
  \ ability to spread rumors. Without his influence, the holding area has calmed down. Guards\
  \ report that the remaining prisoners seem less agitated, and the risk of unrest has been\
  \ minimized.
response.0.RESCUE.failure={0}, moving the prisoner to solitary confinement only fueled the rumors.\
  \ The other prisoners now believe his claims even more strongly, assuming we''re trying to\
  \ silence the truth. Guards report increased hostility, and tensions in the holding area are on\
  \ the rise.
response.1.RESCUE.button=Allow your men to refute his claims in front of the prisoners.
response.1.RESCUE.success={0}, officers publicly refuted the prisoner''s claims, pointing out\
  \ inconsistencies in his story and challenging him to provide proof. The performance discredited\
  \ him in the eyes of the other prisoners, who have started ignoring his outbursts. The holding\
  \ area is stable once again.
response.1.RESCUE.failure={0}, the public debate backfired. The prisoner used the opportunity to rally\
  \ support, twisting the officers'' words to strengthen his narrative. The other prisoners seem\
  \ emboldened, and guards are struggling to contain the unrest spreading through the holding area.
response.2.RESCUE.button=Let him rant. His words will ring hollow when no rescue arrives.
response.2.RESCUE.success={0}, allowing the prisoner to continue ranting proved effective. With no\
  \ rescue arriving, his claims began to sound hollow, and the other prisoners lost interest.\
  \ Guards report that the holding area has returned to normal, and the prisoner''s influence has\
  \ faded.
response.2.RESCUE.failure={0}, ignoring the prisoner''s outbursts was a mistake. His confidence and\
  \ persistence convinced the other prisoners that a rescue was indeed imminent. The population is\
  \ now agitated, and guards are reporting signs of coordinated unrest. The situation is\
  \ deteriorating.
event.REPAIRS.message={0}, one of the prisoners is claiming to have experience repairing combat\
  \ units. They''ve offered to assist in exchange for improved rations and better living conditions.\
  \ Could be an opportunity to make use of their skills, but there''s always the risk they''re\
  \ overstating their abilities - or worse, planning something. Recommend evaluating their\
  \ background and skills before making a decision. Let me know how you want to proceed.
response.0.REPAIRS.button=Allow him limited access to a workshop under heavy supervision.
response.0.REPAIRS.success={0}, the prisoner was granted limited access to the workshop under\
  \ strict supervision. It turns out his claims were genuine. He repaired several critical base\
  \ components, saving valuable time and resources. The guards reported no incidents, and the\
  \ operation was a success.
response.0.REPAIRS.failure={0}, allowing the prisoner into the workshop was a mistake. He sabotaged\
  \ several base components before being caught, leaving the equipment in worse condition than\
  \ before. The guards restrained him before he could do further damage, but the incident has raised\
  \ questions about our screening process.
response.1.REPAIRS.button=Keep him locked up. It''s too risky to trust a prisoner with that kind of\
  \ access.
response.1.REPAIRS.success={0}, the decision to keep the prisoner locked up was prudent. Guards\
  \ later found compound schematics in his cell, indicating he was likely planning to sabotage our\
  \ systems rather than repair them. The holding area remains secure, and the situation is under\
  \ control.
response.1.REPAIRS.failure={0}, denying the prisoner access backfired. News of his offer spread\
  \ among the population, and now many prisoners are accusing us of wasting their talents. Tensions\
  \ in the holding area are rising, and guards are reporting an uptick in defiance and minor\
  \ disruptions.
response.2.REPAIRS.button=Test his knowledge. Ask him a series of questions to gauge his expertise.
response.2.REPAIRS.success={0}, the prisoner''s answers to the technical questions confirmed his\
  \ expertise. His knowledge appears to be legitimate, and granting him supervised access to the\
  \ workshop could be a safe way to capitalize on his skills. The guards report no unusual behavior\
  \ from him so far.
response.2.REPAIRS.failure={0}, the prisoner''s answers to the test were convincing at first, but upon\
  \ closer inspection, they were riddled with inaccuracies. It''s clear he was bluffing. Guards\
  \ report that the other prisoners are mocking him, and the holding area is calmer now that his\
  \ credibility has been shattered.
event.SICKNESS.message={0}, several prisoners have come down with unexplained symptoms - weakness,\
  \ coughing, and fatigue. I''m concerned it could spread, but the prisoners are blaming the\
  \ conditions in the holding cells. We''ve isolated the affected individuals for now, but we may\
  \ need to investigate further to rule out a larger issue. Requesting advice on next steps to\
  \ contain this and maintain order.
response.0.SICKNESS.button=Prevent further spread by isolating the afflicted prisoners.
response.0.SICKNESS.success={0}, the quarantine was effective. The symptoms were contained to the\
  \ isolated group, and no new cases have emerged. Guards ensured the process was orderly, and the\
  \ holding area is stable. The prisoners seem to understand the necessity of the measure, and\
  \ tensions remain low.
response.0.SICKNESS.failure={0}, the quarantine caused a panic among the remaining prisoners, who\
  \ now fear they might be next. Guards report unrest in the holding area, with several prisoners\
  \ accusing us of neglect and inhumane treatment. The symptoms have begun appearing outside the\
  \ quarantine as well, suggesting it may have already spread.
response.1.SICKNESS.button=Allow better ventilation and clean water to improve health.
response.1.SICKNESS.success={0}, allowing better ventilation and providing clean water has\
  \ alleviated the symptoms. The affected prisoners are recovering, and the others seem more at\
  \ ease now that the conditions have been addressed. Guards report a noticeable improvement in\
  \ morale across the holding area.
response.1.SICKNESS.failure={0}, the effort to improve conditions was too little, too late. The\
  \ symptoms have continued to spread, and the remaining prisoners now view this as a sign of\
  \ weakness. Tensions are climbing in the holding area, and the guards are struggling to maintain\
  \ control.
response.2.SICKNESS.button=Let nature take its course - this could reduce the number of prisoners\
  \ causing trouble.
response.2.SICKNESS.success={0}, waiting it out proved to be the right decision. The symptoms\
  \ subsided on their own, and the affected prisoners have returned to their cells without further\
  \ incident. The guards have resumed normal operations, and the holding area remains stable.
response.2.SICKNESS.failure={0}, waiting it out was a disastrous decision. The illness spread rapidly,\
  \ overwhelming both the prisoners and the guards. The holding area is in chaos, and guards are\
  \ struggling to contain the unrest. Several prisoners have accused us of intentionally letting\
  \ this happen, further destabilizing the situation.
event.VETERAN.message={0}, we''ve got a situation involving one of the prisoners and a guard.\
  \ The prisoner recognized them from a previous campaign, and the two exchanged some tense words.\
  \ Sounds like there''s some unresolved history that could cause friction if it escalates.\
  \ Recommend keeping them separated for now and determining if this history poses a security risk.\
  \ Let me know how you want to handle it.
response.0.VETERAN.button=Personal matters aren''t your concern.
response.0.VETERAN.success={0}, allowing the prisoner and the guard to handle it themselves\
  \ appears to have resolved the tension. The two exchanged a few more sharp words but ultimately\
  \ backed down without further incident. The holding area remains calm, and guards report no\
  \ additional issues.
response.0.VETERAN.failure={0}, letting them handle it themselves led to a serious confrontation.\
  \ The prisoner and the guard came to blows, forcing guards to intervene. Both parties are\
  \ injured, and the incident has stirred up unrest among the other prisoners, who now see the crew\
  \ as vulnerable.
response.1.VETERAN.button=Talk to both parties to resolve the issue.
response.1.VETERAN.success={0}, the mediation worked. Speaking with both parties defused the\
  \ tension, and they agreed to avoid further conflict. The guards are keeping a close watch, but\
  \ the situation appears resolved for now, and the holding area is stable.
response.1.VETERAN.failure={0}, the mediation attempt failed. The guard refused to let the\
  \ matter go, and the prisoner retaliated with accusations that stirred up anger among the\
  \ population. Tensions are rising in the holding area, and guards report that the prisoner is\
  \ trying to rally others against the crew.
response.2.VETERAN.button=Avoid further conflict by assigning them to different areas.
response.2.VETERAN.success={0}, separating the prisoner and the guard has successfully\
  \ de-escalated the situation. Both parties have been reassigned to different areas, and guards\
  \ report no further interactions or signs of tension. The holding area is calm for now.
response.2.VETERAN.failure={0}, separating them only fueled the prisoner''s anger. They''ve started\
  \ spreading stories about their history with the guard, stirring up resentment among the\
  \ other prisoners. G=The other guards are now reporting signs of unrest, and the situation is\
  \ becomin volatile.
event.GRAFFITI.message={0}, we''ve discovered crude graffiti on the walls of the holding cells.\
  \ It''s an unflattering depiction of you, accompanied by slogans promoting rebellion. While it''s\
  \ likely meant to rile up the other prisoners, it''s also a sign that tensions might be higher\
  \ than we realized. We''ve cleaned it up, but we recommend increased vigilance in the holding\
  \ area to prevent further incidents. Your guidance on next steps would be appreciated.
response.0.GRAFFITI.button=Order the prisoners to scrub the walls themselves.
response.0.GRAFFITI.success={0}, the prisoners were ordered to scrub the walls themselves, and the\
  \ act of cleaning seems to have embarrassed and subdued them. Guards report that the prisoners\
  \ have been quieter since the incident, and no further graffiti has been discovered.
response.0.GRAFFITI.failure={0}, forcing the prisoners to clean up the graffiti sparked resentment.\
  \ They viewed it as a humiliation tactic and have grown even more defiant. Guards report an\
  \ uptick in mutterings about rebellion, and the holding area feels tense.
response.1.GRAFFITI.button=A little art won''t hurt morale.
response.1.GRAFFITI.success={0}, ignoring the graffiti proved to be a wise decision. Without\
  \ attention, the prisoners lost interest in their ''art'' and moved on to other distractions.\
  \ Guards report no further incidents, and tensions in the holding area appear to be under control.
response.1.GRAFFITI.failure={0}, choosing to ignore the graffiti only emboldened the prisoners. New\
  \ slogans and drawings have appeared, spreading throughout the holding area and fostering a sense\
  \ of defiance among the population. Guards are now concerned about the growing unrest.
response.2.GRAFFITI.button=Question prisoners to find out who''s behind the graffiti.
response.2.GRAFFITI.success={0}, questioning the prisoners led to the identification of the\
  \ ringleader behind the graffiti. They''ve been isolated, and guards report that the incident has\
  \ not been repeated. The remaining prisoners appear more subdued now that the instigator has been\
  \ dealt with.
response.2.GRAFFITI.failure={0}, the investigation failed to uncover the responsible party, but it\
  \ did succeed in agitating the prisoners. They viewed the questioning as harassment, and tensions\
  \ in the holding area have increased. Guards are reporting a heightened sense of defiance among\
  \ the population.
event.PRAYER.message={0}, a group of prisoners has started holding loud, daily prayer sessions.\
  \ While they haven''t caused any direct trouble, the noise is disrupting the other prisoners, and\
  \ we''re beginning to see some friction between the groups. We can try to mediate or enforce\
  \ restrictions, but we''ll need your decision on how to proceed to avoid further conflicts.
response.0.PRAYER.button=Religious freedom shouldn''t be curtailed, as long as it doesn''t cause\
  \ problems.
response.0.PRAYER.success={0}, allowing the prayer sessions to continue has helped ease tensions\
  \ among the worshippers, and they''ve kept their behavior within acceptable limits. While some\
  \ prisoners still grumble about the noise, guards report that the overall mood in the holding\
  \ area is stable.
response.0.PRAYER.failure={0}, allowing the prayer sessions has led to increased friction in the\
  \ holding area. Non-participating prisoners are growing resentful, viewing the allowance as\
  \ favoritism. The conflict between the groups is escalating, and guards are struggling to\
  \ maintain order.
response.1.PRAYER.button=Set aside a space for their worship, away from the others.
response.1.PRAYER.success={0}, the decision to designate a separate space for worship has\
  \ successfully reduced the disruption in the main holding area. The worshippers are satisfied\
  \ with the arrangement, and the other prisoners seem calmer now that the noise is no longer an\
  \ issue. Guards report that the situation is under control.
response.1.PRAYER.failure={0}, moving the worshippers only created more tension. The other\
  \ prisoners viewed the allocation of a separate space as favoritism, and the worshippers\
  \ themselves complained about being isolated. Guards are reporting growing hostility between the\
  \ groups, and the situation is becoming volatile.
response.2.PRAYER.button=No religious practices on your watch - it''s too divisive.
response.2.PRAYER.success={0}, banning the prayer sessions has restored order to the holding area.\
  \ While the worshippers initially protested, they have since complied, and the friction with\
  \ other prisoners has subsided. Guards report a return to normal operations in the facility.
response.2.PRAYER.failure={0}, banning the prayer sessions backfired. The worshippers are furious\
  \ and have begun spreading dissent among the prisoners, accusing us of violating their rights.\
  \ The holding area is now rife with tension, and guards are reporting signs of escalating unrest.
event.BARTERING.message={0}, two prisoners were caught bartering a pack of cigarettes for what\
  \ appears to be "sensitive information" regarding our unit''s operations. I overheard parts of\
  \ the conversation, and it''s clear this isn''t just idle talk. We''ve separated the prisoners\
  \ for now, but we may need to interrogate them further to assess the severity of the breach.\
  \ Advise on how you want to handle this.
response.0.BARTERING.button=Crack down on bartering and contraband trading.
response.0.BARTERING.success={0}, the contraband was confiscated, and a thorough sweep of the\
  \ holding area uncovered additional items tied to bartering activities. The crackdown has\
  \ disrupted their trading network, and guards report no further suspicious activity. The\
  \ situation appears contained.
response.0.BARTERING.failure={0}, confiscating contraband sparked an uproar among the prisoners.\
  \ They see it as an overreach, and tensions in the holding area are rising. Worse, the traders\
  \ clammed up, leaving us with no further insight into what information they were sharing. The\
  \ issue remains unresolved.
response.1.BARTERING.button=Find out what information they''re exchanging.
response.1.BARTERING.success={0}, interrogating the prisoners separately revealed critical details.\
  \ One prisoner admitted to passing outdated intel in exchange for contraband, but the information\
  \ poses no current threat to operations. The ringleaders have been isolated, and the guards\
  \ report no further incidents.
response.1.BARTERING.failure={0}, the separate interrogations failed. Both prisoners provided\
  \ conflicting stories, and now the rest of the population is suspicious of our methods. Guards\
  \ report whispers of conspiracy and growing hostility among the prisoners, making the holding\
  \ area increasingly volatile.
response.2.BARTERING.button=It''s probably just rumors; no harm done.
response.2.BARTERING.success={0}, letting the incident go appears to have defused the situation\
  \ quietly. The prisoners involved have resumed their routines without further trouble, and guards\
  \ have detected no signs of continued bartering or information exchanges. The holding area\
  \ remains calm.
response.2.BARTERING.failure={0}, ignoring the situation was a mistake. Further investigation\
  \ revealed that sensitive operational details were indeed being passed along, and it''s unclear\
  \ how far this information has spread. The lapse in security has shaken morale among the guards,\
  \ and the risk of future breaches has increased.
event.OFFICER.message={0}, a captured officer is refusing to share quarters with enlisted\
  \ prisoners, saying it''s beneath their dignity. The enlisted prisoners are becoming agitated,\
  \ seeing it as favoritism and unfair treatment. The tension is starting to escalate, and we may\
  \ need to intervene before it becomes a larger issue. Suggest determining whether to enforce\
  \ equal conditions or provide separate accommodations for the officer. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.OFFICER.button=Everyone gets the same conditions, no matter their rank.
response.0.OFFICER.success={0}, enforcing equal conditions for all prisoners has eased tensions\
  \ among the enlisted population. While the officer initially protested, they''ve since complied.\
  \ Guards report a noticeable decrease in hostility, and the holding area is stable once again.
response.0.OFFICER.failure={0}, forcing the officer to share quarters with the enlisted prisoners\
  \ backfired. The officer''s complaints have riled up the rest of the population, leading to\
  \ arguments and minor scuffles. Guards are reporting increased unrest, and the situation is\
  \ becoming harder to contain.
response.1.OFFICER.button=Give the officer his way. Sometimes maintaining the chain of command\
  \ keeps order.
response.1.OFFICER.success={0}, granting the officer separate accommodations appears to have\
  \ prevented further escalation. While the enlisted prisoners grumbled about it at first, they\
  \ seem to have accepted the decision. Guards report that the situation has calmed, and order is\
  \ holding in the holding area.
response.1.OFFICER.failure={0}, allowing the officer separate accommodations has worsened the\
  \ situation. The enlisted prisoners see it as blatant favoritism, and tensions have erupted into\
  \ open defiance. Guards are struggling to maintain control, and the holding area is on the verge\
  \ of chaos.
response.2.OFFICER.button=Subtly pit the groups against each other to keep them distracted.
response.2.OFFICER.success={0}, subtly encouraging division between the officer and the enlisted\
  \ prisoners has worked. The groups are too focused on their own arguments to organize against\
  \ the guards. The holding area is tense, but the distractions have kept the prisoners manageable\
  \ for now.
response.2.OFFICER.failure={0}, the attempt to exploit the tension backfired. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the manipulation and turned their frustration toward the guards. Guards report growing\
  \ hostility, and the holding area is now more unstable than ever.
event.DICE.message={0}, we''ve discovered some prisoners running a dice-based gambling game, using\
  \ scraps of cloth as currency. So far, it seems harmless, but we''re not sure if letting it\
  \ continue might lead to disputes or cause bigger problems later. Do you want us to shut it down\
  \ now or monitor it for the time being? Awaiting your guidance.
response.0.DICE.button=Break it up. Gambling could lead to fights; it''s not worth the risk.
response.0.DICE.success={0}, the gambling operation was shut down swiftly. Guards confiscated the\
  \ dice and ''currency'' without incident, and the prisoners involved returned to their cells. The\
  \ holding area is calm, and no signs of tension have been observed since.
response.0.DICE.failure={0}, breaking up the gambling game caused an uproar. The prisoners accused\
  \ the guards of overstepping, and several have become openly defiant. The situation in the\
  \ holding area is now more volatile, with guards reporting an increase in tension and unrest.
response.1.DICE.button=Let it continue. Harmless fun might keep morale from dropping too low.
response.1.DICE.success={0}, allowing the gambling game to continue has provided a harmless\
  \ distraction for the prisoners. Guards report that morale in the holding area has improved,\
  \ and no disputes have arisen. The situation remains stable, and the prisoners seem more\
  \ cooperative overall.
response.1.DICE.failure={0}, allowing the gambling game to continue led to trouble. A heated\
  \ dispute over winnings erupted into a physical fight, forcing guards to intervene. Several\
  \ prisoners were injured, and the holding area is now on edge. Guards are monitoring closely to\
  \ prevent further incidents.
response.2.DICE.button=Tax the winnings. Use it as a way to assert control over the prisoners.
response.2.DICE.success={0}, the decision to tax the winnings has established control over the\
  \ gambling operation. The prisoners grudgingly accepted the arrangement, and the guards are\
  \ using the proceeds to maintain order. Tensions are low, and the holding area is running\
  \ smoothly.
response.2.DICE.failure={0}, attempting to tax the gambling operation backfired. The prisoners\
  \ accused the guards of exploitation, and the situation escalated into open defiance. Guards are\
  \ now struggling to maintain order, and the holding area is becoming increasingly unstable.
event.LOVERS.message={0}, one of my men has been observed chatting a bit too amicably with the\
  \ prisoners. Other guards are concerned this could lead to information leaks or compromise\
  \ security if the prisoners try to exploit the situation. We can address this with the guard\
  \ directly, but I''d appreciate your guidance on how to proceed to prevent any further risks.
response.0.LOVERS.button=Issue a stern reminder to keep professional boundaries.
response.0.LOVERS.success={0}, the guard was given a stern warning about maintaining professional\
  \ boundaries. They acknowledged the concern and have adjusted their behavior accordingly. Guards\
  \ report no further issues, and the situation appears to be under control.
response.0.LOVERS.failure={0}, the warning seemed to have little effect. The guard''s interactions\
  \ with the prisoners have continued, and other guards are now voicing concerns about divided\
  \ loyalties. Tensions among the staff are rising, and security may be at risk.
response.1.LOVERS.button=Move the guard to a different post to avoid further issues.
response.1.LOVERS.success={0}, the guard was reassigned to a different post, reducing their contact\
  \ with the prisoners. The transition was smooth, and the other guards have reported feeling more\
  \ confident about the security of the holding area. The issue appears resolved.
response.1.LOVERS.failure={0}, reassigning the guard created unintended friction among the team.\
  \ Some guards believe the reassignment was unfair, while others remain suspicious of the guard''s\
  \ intentions. The resulting discord has lowered morale and strained the security team.
response.2.LOVERS.button=Investigate further. Is this a simple mistake, or is the guard being\
  \ manipulated?
response.2.LOVERS.success={0}, the investigation revealed no malicious intent - just a lapse in\
  \ judgment. The guard has been counseled, and their interactions with the prisoners have returned\
  \ to a professional standard. The holding area is secure, and the guards'' concerns have been\
  \ eased.
response.2.LOVERS.failure={0}, the investigation uncovered evidence of manipulation by the\
  \ prisoners. It seems the guard was being coerced into providing minor favors, which could have\
  \ escalated if left unchecked. While the guard has been reassigned, the prisoners now seem\
  \ emboldened, and tensions are higher in the holding area.
event.SOBBING.message={0}, one of the prisoners has been sobbing uncontrollably during the night,\
  \ disturbing the others. Some prisoners are mocking the outburst, while others seem genuinely\
  \ concerned. The noise is starting to cause unrest in the holding cells. We can isolate the\
  \ prisoner for the sake of order or investigate further to determine if there''s something deeper\
  \ at play. Requesting your direction.
response.0.SOBBING.button=This is not your problem to solve.
response.0.SOBBING.success={0}, leaving the prisoner alone allowed the situation to settle on its\
  \ own. The other prisoners eventually grew tired of the noise and stopped reacting to it. Guards\
  \ report that tensions in the holding area have eased, and order has been maintained.
response.0.SOBBING.failure={0}, ignoring the situation made things worse. The sobbing prisoner''s\
  \ behavior escalated, causing significant disruption in the holding area. Other prisoners began\
  \ to grow more restless, and the guards report increased hostility as a result of the disturbance.
response.1.SOBBING.button=Send in a MedTech or Guard to calm the prisoner.
response.1.SOBBING.success={0}, sending in a guard to speak with the prisoner calmed them down\
  \ significantly. It seems they were overwhelmed by fear and isolation, and the conversation\
  \ helped restore their composure. The holding area is quieter now, and tensions have eased.
response.1.SOBBING.failure={0}, the attempt at counseling failed. The prisoner became even more\
  \ distraught, claiming they couldn''t trust anyone. The visible turmoil has affected the other\
  \ prisoners, leading to heated arguments and unrest. Guards are struggling to maintain order in\
  \ the holding area.
response.2.SOBBING.button=Order the guards to restore order, no matter the method.
response.2.SOBBING.success={0}, the guards stepped in to restore order, and the sobbing prisoner\
  \ has been moved to a quieter area. While some prisoners muttered complaints, the intervention\
  \ stopped the disruption, and the holding area has returned to normal operations.
response.2.SOBBING.failure={0}, silencing the prisoner caused an uproar. The other prisoners saw it\
  \ as unnecessary cruelty, leading to widespread defiance and an increase in tension. Guards report\
  \ that the holding area is on edge, and the risk of further unrest has grown significantly.
event.PROPAGANDA.message={0}, we''ve discovered a stash of propaganda leaflets hidden among the\
  \ prisoners'' possessions. It''s unclear whether they''re being used to boost morale or as part\
  \ of an undercover effort. Either way, this could pose a risk if it spreads. We''ve confiscated\
  \ the materials for now, but we may need to interrogate the prisoners involved to determine\
  \ their intent. Let us know how you want to proceed.
response.0.PROPAGANDA.button=Eliminate the material before it spreads.
response.0.PROPAGANDA.success={0}, the leaflets were destroyed immediately. Guards made it clear\
  \ that such materials won''t be tolerated, and the prisoners seem to have taken the message\
  \ seriously. No further propaganda has been discovered, and the situation remains under control.
response.0.PROPAGANDA.failure={0}, destroying the leaflets only angered the prisoners. They''ve\
  \ started spreading rumors about suppression and retaliation, leading to increased tension in the\
  \ holding area. Guards are now reporting a rise in defiance and mutterings of rebellion.
response.1.PROPAGANDA.button=Find out who smuggled it in and why.
response.1.PROPAGANDA.success={0}, interrogating the prisoners involved uncovered the source of the\
  \ propaganda. It seems to have been smuggled in with supplies from outside. With this\
  \ information, we''ve secured the supply lines and prevented further incidents. The holding area\
  \ is stable.
response.1.PROPAGANDA.failure={0}, the interrogation didn''t yield any useful information. Instead,\
  \ it caused unrest among the prisoners, who now view it as an overreach. Guards report increased\
  \ hostility and a concerning rise in defiant behavior in the holding area.
response.2.PROPAGANDA.button=Sometimes letting them keep small comforts prevents bigger problems.
response.2.PROPAGANDA.success={0}, allowing the prisoners to keep the leaflets seems to have defused\
  \ tension. Guards report that while the materials are circulating, they''re mostly being used as\
  \ morale boosters rather than anything subversive. The holding area remains calm, and order is\
  \ intact.
response.2.PROPAGANDA.failure={0}, allowing the leaflets to circulate was a mistake. The prisoners are\
  \ now rallying around the propaganda, using it to organize and spread anti-authority sentiments.\
  \ Guards are struggling to contain the growing unrest, and the situation in the holding area is\
  \ becoming volatile.
event.SONGS.message={0}, the prisoners have started singing old war songs, loudly and in unison.\
  \ We''re not sure if it''s just a morale booster or if it''s meant to serve as some kind of\

  \ Recommend deciding whether to let it continue or take steps to disrupt it. Awaiting your\
  \ guidance.
response.0.SONGS.button=Ban singing. Order the guards to stop any organized group activity.
response.0.SONGS.success={0}, the guards stepped in and put an end to the singing. While the\
  \ prisoners were unhappy, the swift action has prevented any further organized displays. The\
  \ holding area has quieted down, and the situation is back under control.
response.0.SONGS.failure={0}, banning the singing caused an uproar among the prisoners. They view\
  \ it as an attack on their identity, and tensions in the holding area have skyrocketed. Guards\
  \ are reporting increased defiance, and the situation is becoming more unstable by the hour.
response.1.SONGS.button=It''s just music - what harm could it do?
response.1.SONGS.success={0}, allowing the singing to continue seems to have had a positive effect.\
  \ The prisoners are calmer, and the unity displayed appears to be limited to boosting morale\
  \ rather than anything subversive. The holding area remains stable for now.
response.1.SONGS.failure={0}, letting the singing continue was a mistake. It has emboldened the\
  \ prisoners, who are now treating it as a form of defiance. Guards are reporting an increase in\
  \ coordinated behavior and suspect the songs are being used to send covert signals. The holding\
  \ area is becoming more tense.
response.2.SONGS.button=Record the lyrics to see if they include hidden messages.
response.2.SONGS.success={0}, recording and analyzing the lyrics revealed a mix of nostalgic war\
  \ anthems and veiled references to past battles. Guards identified a subtle code within the\
  \ songs, allowing us to uncover a minor plot before it could be executed. The situation has been\
  \ diffused, and order remains intact.
response.2.SONGS.failure={0}, attempts to analyze the songs yielded no actionable intel. Meanwhile,\

  \ The holding area is now more volatile, and guards are struggling to maintain control.
event.REFUSE_RATIONS.message={0}, a small group of prisoners is refusing their rations, claiming they''re being\

response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.button=They''ll eat when they''re hungry enough.
response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.success={0}, ignoring the refusal to eat proved effective. After a few\
  \ hours, the protesting prisoners gave up and resumed eating with no further incident. Guards\
  \ report that the rest of the population has remained calm, and the situation is back to normal.
response.0.REFUSE_RATIONS.failure={0}, ignoring the protest backfired. The hunger strike gained\
  \ traction among the other prisoners, and now a significant portion of the population is refusing\
  \ to eat. Tensions in the holding area are rising, and guards are struggling to maintain control.
response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.button=Speak to the ringleader and see what they want.
response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.success={0}, speaking with the ringleader revealed the root of their\
  \ complaints. Minor adjustments to rations and living conditions were enough to defuse the\
  \ situation, and the prisoners have resumed eating. The holding area is calm, and guards report\
  \ no further unrest.
response.1.REFUSE_RATIONS.failure={0}, the negotiation attempt failed. The ringleader used the\
  \ opportunity to rally more prisoners to their cause, turning a small protest into a larger\
  \ movement. Guards are\ now dealing with increased defiance, and the holding area is becoming\
  \ more volatile.
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.button=Force-feed them. Demonstrate that resistance won''t work here.
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.success={0}, the guards demonstrated clear authority, and the prisoners''\
  \ resistance quickly crumbled. While the act of force-feeding them was unpleasant, it sent a\
  \ strong message that defiance wouldn''t be tolerated. The rest of the population has remained\
  \ compliant, and the holding area is stable.
response.2.REFUSE_RATIONS.failure={0}, force-feeding the prisoners enraged the population. The act\

  \ deteriorating rapidly.
event.PLOTTING.message={0}, one of my guards overheard prisoners talking about "the perfect time" to make\

  \ increased vigilance for now, but it might be worth interrogating the prisoners involved or\
  \ stepping up security measures. Let us know how you''d like to proceed.
response.0.PLOTTING.button=Increase patrols and inspections.
response.0.PLOTTING.success={0}, increasing patrols and inspections proved effective. Guards discovered\
  \ and confiscated makeshift tools hidden among the prisoners'' belongings, possibly intended for\
  \ an escape attempt. The heightened security has deterred further planning, and the holding area\
  \ is secure.
response.0.PLOTTING.failure={0}, tightening security agitated the prisoners, who view the increased\
  \ measures as harassment. While no concrete evidence of a breakout was found, tensions have risen\
  \ significantly in the holding area. Guards report that the prisoners are growing more defiant.
response.1.PLOTTING.button=Interrogate the leaders to find out who''s behind the whispers.
response.1.PLOTTING.success={0}, interrogating the suspected leaders revealed valuable intelligence. It\
  \ appears the prisoners were testing the guards'' reactions and probing for weak spots. The\
  \ ringleaders have been isolated, and the guards are now better prepared to prevent any attempts\
  \ at escape.
response.1.PLOTTING.failure={0}, the interrogation yielded no actionable information, but it caused\
  \ significant unrest among the prisoners. Many are now openly accusing the guards of unfair\
  \ treatment, and tensions in the holding area are escalating rapidly.
response.2.PLOTTING.button=Idle talk doesn''t mean a real threat.
response.2.PLOTTING.success={0}, ignoring the chatter turned out to be the right decision. The talk of\
  \ a breakout was just idle banter, and the prisoners eventually moved on to other distractions.\
  \ Guards report no signs of unusual activity, and the holding area remains calm.
response.2.PLOTTING.failure={0}, ignoring the chatter was a mistake. A coordinated escape attempt was\
  \ uncovered too late, and while the prisoners were caught before breaking out, the breach has\
  \ shaken the guards'' confidence. The holding area is now unstable, and tensions are at an\
  \ all-time high.
event.EQUIPMENT.message={0}, a piece of surveillance equipment in the holding area has been found\

  \ this.
response.0.EQUIPMENT.button=Determine if sabotage is to blame.
response.0.EQUIPMENT.success={0}, a thorough investigation revealed evidence of deliberate\

  \ disciplined. Guards have increased their vigilance, and the holding area remains secure.
response.0.EQUIPMENT.failure={0}, despite the investigation, we found no definitive proof of\

  \ defiance in the holding area. The tension is beginning to rise.
response.1.EQUIPMENT.button=Repair it and move on. It''s not worth the resources to dig into this.
response.1.EQUIPMENT.success={0}, the decision to repair the equipment without further action seems\
  \ to have paid off. Guards report no further tampering, and the situation in the holding area\
  \ remains calm. It appears this was an isolated incident.
response.1.EQUIPMENT.failure={0}, ignoring the incident has backfired. The prisoners have started\

  \ scrambling to address multiple points of sabotage, and tensions are escalating.
response.2.EQUIPMENT.button=Punish them all and make the prisoners understand sabotage will not be\
  \ tolerated.
response.2.EQUIPMENT.success={0}, the collective punishment sent a clear message. The prisoners are\
  \ subdued, and guards report no further incidents of tampering. The holding area is tense, but\
  \ order has been maintained for now.
response.2.EQUIPMENT.failure={0}, punishing the entire population has caused significant unrest.\

  \ Awaiting your guidance.
response.0.PLANNED_RESCUE.button=Announce that no rescue is coming to spread doubt.
response.0.PLANNED_RESCUE.success={0}, announcing that no rescue was coming successfully sowed\
  \ doubt among the prisoners. The ringleader''s claims have been largely dismissed by the\
  \ population, and the overall mood has stabilized. Guards report no further disruptions, and\
  \ order has been maintained.
response.0.PLANNED_RESCUE.failure={0}, calling their bluff backfired. The prisoners interpreted the\
  \ announcement as a desperate attempt to suppress the truth. Hope has spread like wildfire, and\
  \ tensions in the holding area have escalated sharply. Guards are reporting signs of increased\
  \ coordination among the prisoners.
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.button=Find out if there''s any truth to the claim.
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.success={0}, interrogating the prisoner revealed the claim to be\
  \ baseless. The prisoner admitted to fabricating the story to raise morale among their comrades.\
  \ The guards have since discredited the claim among the prisoners, and the holding area is calm\
  \ once again.
response.1.PLANNED_RESCUE.failure={0}, the interrogation yielded no clear answers, but it further\
  \ emboldened the prisoners. They now view the prisoner as a symbol of resistance, rallying behind\
  \ their defiance. Guards are reporting a noticeable rise in unrest throughout the holding area.
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.button=Just in case, increase security in key areas.
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.success={0}, reinforcing security measures proved prudent. While no\
  \ rescue attempt materialized, the show of force has deterred further defiance among the\
  \ prisoners. Guards report that the population is more subdued, and the holding area is secure.
response.2.PLANNED_RESCUE.failure={0}, increasing security measures had the unintended effect of\
  \ validating the prisoner''s claims in the eyes of the prisoners. They believe the additional\
  \ defenses are proof that a rescue is imminent, and tensions are now at an all-time high. Guards\
  \ are struggling to maintain control.
event.MISTAKE.message={0}, one of the prisoners is insisting they were captured by mistake,\
  \ claiming to be a civilian rather than a soldier. Their story sounds plausible, but we currently\
  \ have no way to verify it. This could be an attempt to manipulate us, or it might genuinely\
  \ warrant further investigation. Requesting guidance on how to proceed - whether to interrogate\
  \ further, hold them, or escalate the matter.
response.0.MISTAKE.button=You can''t take any chances - they stay with the others.
response.0.MISTAKE.success={0}, the decision to hold the prisoner has prevented potential security\
  \ risks. Guards report no further incidents, and the prisoner seems resigned to their situation.\
  \ The holding area remains calm, and the rest of the population appears unaffected by the\
  \ decision.
response.0.MISTAKE.failure={0}, holding the prisoner without investigating has caused unrest. Some\
  \ prisoners have started questioning the fairness of their treatment, and guards report growing\
  \ tensions in the holding area. The situation may escalate if this issue isn''t addressed.
response.1.MISTAKE.button=Assign someone to verify their story, if possible.
response.1.MISTAKE.success={0}, the investigation confirmed the prisoner''s story - they are indeed\
  \ a civilian. The prisoner has been moved to more appropriate accommodations, and the other\
  \ prisoners seem less agitated now that the issue was handled fairly. The holding area remains\
  \ stable.
response.1.MISTAKE.failure={0}, the investigation turned up no evidence to support the prisoner''s\
  \ claim, but the time it took emboldened the rest of the population. Guards report whispers of\
  \ manipulation and growing defiance among the prisoners, making the holding area increasingly\
  \ unstable.
response.2.MISTAKE.button=Move them to better quarters, but you can''t risk freeing them.
response.2.MISTAKE.success={0}, moving the prisoner to better quarters seems to have defused the\
  \ immediate tension. The other prisoners took note of the gesture, and the holding area remains\
  \ calm. Guards report no further issues, though the situation is being monitored closely.
response.2.MISTAKE.failure={0}, moving the prisoner caused significant backlash. The rest of the\
  \ population now views this as favoritism, and guards report increased hostility in the holding\
  \ area. The situation has become more volatile, and the risk of unrest is growing.
event.LETTER.message={0}, I''ve just intercepted a letter from a prisoner, written entirely in\
  \ code. It''s addressed to someone outside the facility, but we haven''t been able to determine\
  \ its contents yet. This could be an attempt to coordinate with outside forces or something less\
  \ significant. We recommend decoding the message immediately and monitoring the prisoner''s\
  \ communications more closely. Awaiting your instructions
response.0.LETTER.button=Assign a specialist to figure out what it says.
response.0.LETTER.success={0}, the code was successfully cracked, revealing plans for a coordinated\
  \ escape attempt. The information allowed us to intercept key communications and isolate the\
  \ involved prisoners. The holding area is secure, and guards are on heightened alert.
response.0.LETTER.failure={0}, despite our best efforts, the code couldn''t be cracked in time. The\
  \ contents remain a mystery, and tensions are rising as the other prisoners sense increased guard\
  \ activity. This may have emboldened the population, and the situation remains unstable.
response.1.LETTER.button=Eliminate the letter without risking the contents getting out.
response.1.LETTER.success={0}, the letter was destroyed immediately, ensuring its contents won''t\
  \ reach the intended recipient. While the prisoner expressed frustration, no further incidents\
  \ have occurred. The holding area remains under control, and the risk of external coordination\
  \ has been neutralized.
response.1.LETTER.failure={0}, burning the letter seems to have backfired. The prisoner''s reaction\
  \ was extreme, and they''ve begun spreading claims that we''re hiding something from the\
  \ population. Tensions in the holding area have increased, and guards report growing unrest among\
  \ the prisoners.
response.2.LETTER.button=Send it to the intended recipient to see what happens.
response.2.LETTER.success={0}, delivering the letter led to an unexpected breakthrough. By\
  \ monitoring the recipient, we uncovered a small network of operatives outside the facility. With\
  \ this information, we''ve taken measures to neutralize the threat. The holding area remains\
  \ stable.
response.2.LETTER.failure={0}, delivering the letter turned out to be a major risk. The recipient\
  \ was alerted and may have used the contents to plan further subversive actions. The holding area\
  \ remains tense, and guards are preparing for potential repercussions from outside forces.
event.ILLNESS.message={0}, several prisoners are claiming they''ve come down with a highly\
  \ contagious local illness. We can''t confirm the legitimacy of their symptoms yet, but we''re\
  \ concerned it could spread to the crew if it''s real. For now, we''ve isolated the affected\
  \ prisoners, but we recommend bringing in medical personnel to assess the situation and taking\
  \ precautions to prevent an outbreak. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.ILLNESS.button=Separate the prisoners to protect your crew.
response.0.ILLNESS.success={0}, the quarantine was effective. Any potential illness has been\
  \ contained, and no symptoms have appeared among the crew or other prisoners. The isolated\
  \ prisoners seem to be recovering, and guards report that the holding area is stable.
response.0.ILLNESS.failure={0}, the quarantine caused unrest among the prisoners, who now believe\
  \ they''re being unfairly punished. Tensions have risen sharply, and guards report increased\
  \ defiance. To make matters worse, symptoms are now spreading to other parts of the holding area.
response.1.ILLNESS.button=Assume it''s a ploy and take no action.
response.1.ILLNESS.success={0}, assuming it was a ploy proved correct. The prisoners eventually\
  \ admitted to faking the symptoms in an attempt to gain better treatment. Guards report that the\
  \ holding area has returned to normal, and no further incidents have occurred.
response.1.ILLNESS.failure={0}, ignoring the claims backfired. What was thought to be a bluff\
  \ turned out to be a legitimate illness, and symptoms have begun spreading to other prisoners and\
  \ guards. The situation is deteriorating, and guards are scrambling to prevent a full-blown\
  \ outbreak.
response.2.ILLNESS.button=Treat the prisoners to ensure safety.
response.2.ILLNESS.success={0}, bringing in medical personnel confirmed the illness was genuine but\
  \ minor. The affected prisoners were treated quickly, and the rest of the population was\
  \ reassured by the proactive response. Guards report improved morale, and the holding area\
  \ remains secure.
response.2.ILLNESS.failure={0}, the arrival of medical personnel caused chaos. Some prisoners\
  \ attempted to exploit the situation to gain better conditions, while others accused the staff\
  \ of experimenting on them. Tensions in the holding area are escalating, and guards are reporting\
  \ a surge in hostility.
event.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.message={0}, one of the prisoners just handed me a\
  \ folded piece of paper shaped like a unicorn. It appears harmless, but the gesture feels oddly\
  \ symbolic, and we''re unsure how to interpret it. This could be a message, a distraction, or\
  \ just an unusual display of creativity. We''ll keep an eye on the prisoner for any further\
  \ behavior, but let us know if you want us to take any specific actions.
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.button=Destroy it. It''s just paper, but better\
  \ safe than sorry.
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.success={0}, the paper unicorn was destroyed\
  \ without incident. While the prisoner seemed mildly displeased, no further strange behavior has\
  \ been observed. Guards report that the holding area remains calm, and the matter appears\
  \ resolved.
response.0.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.failure={0}, destroying the paper unicorn agitated\
  \ the prisoner and sparked curiosity among the others. Whispers about hidden messages and\
  \ defiance have begun circulating, and guards report a subtle increase in tension within the\
  \ holding area.
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.button=Speak to the prisoner and understand their\
  \ intentions.
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.success={0}, speaking with the prisoner revealed\
  \ the unicorn was simply a gesture of peace and creativity. The explanation eased any concerns,\
  \ and the interaction seemed to foster a sense of calm among the prisoners. The holding area is\
  \ stable, and no further incidents have occurred.
response.1.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.failure={0}, the prisoner refused to explain the\
  \ unicorn''s meaning, claiming, "You''ll understand in time." This cryptic response has unnerved\
  \ the guards and sparked rumors among the prisoners. Tensions in the holding area are rising, and\
  \ the situation feels increasingly uneasy.
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.button=Add it to your collection of oddities.
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.success={0}, the paper unicorn was added to your\
  \ collection of oddities, and the prisoner seemed pleased that their creation was appreciated.\
  \ Guards report that the gesture has had a calming effect on the holding area, and the other\
  \ prisoners appear less agitated.
response.2.DO_ANDROIDS_DREAM_OF_ELECTRONIC_SHEEP.failure={0}, keeping the paper unicorn as a\
  \ curiosity has caused unease among the prisoners. Many believe it''s being analyzed for hidden\
  \ meaning, and the prisoner who made it has become oddly withdrawn. The holding area feels tense,\
  \ and guards are reporting subtle shifts in behavior.
event.HEAVY_METAL.message={0}, the other guards have reported hearing strange metallic noises\
  \ coming from the holding area during the night. We haven''t identified the source yet, but it''s\
  \ unusual enough to raise concerns. It could be something innocuous, like environmental issues,\
  \ or something deliberate, like tampering or preparations for escape. Recommend conducting a\
  \ thorough inspection of the area to ensure everything is secure. Awaiting your guidance.
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.button=Search thoroughly for contraband or escape attempts.
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.success={0}, the inspection revealed a hidden stash of makeshift tools and\
  \ partially loosened bolts on one of the vents. The contraband was confiscated, and the prisoners\
  \ involved have been isolated. Guards report that the holding area is secure, and no further\
  \ noises have been heard.
response.0.HEAVY_METAL.failure={0}, the inspection turned up nothing unusual, but the process\
  \ caused unrest among the prisoners. They''re now accusing the guards of harassment, and tensions\
  \ in the holding area have increased. Guards report more hostility from the population.
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.button=It''s probably just the old ventilation system.
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.success={0}, ignoring the noises proved to be the right call. The sound was\
  \ traced to an aging ventilation duct, which has since stopped making noise. Guards report that\
  \ the  holding area is calm, and no further incidents have occurred.
response.1.HEAVY_METAL.failure={0}, ignoring the noises was a mistake. A hidden escape tunnel was\
  \ discovered too late, and several prisoners were caught trying to break through. While the\
  \ attempt was thwarted, the incident has shaken the guards'' confidence, and tensions are rising\
  \ in the holding area.
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.button=Use the noise to lure out whoever is causing it.
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.success={0}, the guards set a trap, quietly monitoring the source of the\
  \ noises. They successfully caught two prisoners tampering with a vent during the night. The\
  \ prisoners have been isolated, and their tools confiscated. The holding area is stable, and no\
  \ further incidents have been reported.
response.2.HEAVY_METAL.failure={0}, the attempt to set a trap failed. Whoever was causing the\
  \ noises appears to have caught on and stopped before revealing themselves. Guards are left\
  \ uneasy, and the holding area is tense with rumors of an organized plot among the prisoners.
event.PARANOIA.message={0}, one of the prisoners is growing increasingly agitated, insisting that\
  \ someone is going to kill them. While there''s no evidence to support their claim, their\
  \ paranoia is beginning to disrupt the other prisoners. This could escalate if not addressed.\
  \ Recommend monitoring the prisoner closely and deciding whether to confront or attempt to calm\
  \ them down. Let us know how you''d like to proceed.
response.0.PARANOIA.button=Assign a guard to reassure the prisoner.
response.0.PARANOIA.success={0}, a guard was assigned to reassure the prisoner, carefully\
  \ addressing their concerns without validating the paranoia. This approach calmed the prisoner,\
  \ and their disruptive behavior has subsided. Guards report that the holding area is stable, and\
  \ tensions are low.
response.0.PARANOIA.failure={0}, humoring the prisoner only fueled their paranoia. They now believe\
  \ the guard is part of a conspiracy, and their agitation has spread to a small group of\
  \ prisoners. Guards are reporting increased tension in the holding area as rumors take hold.
response.1.PARANOIA.button=Remove them before their paranoia spreads.
response.1.PARANOIA.success={0}, isolating the prisoner successfully prevented their paranoia from\
  \ spreading. While they remain agitated, the rest of the holding area is calm, and guards report\
  \ no further disruptions. The situation is under control for now.
response.1.PARANOIA.failure={0}, isolating the prisoner caused unrest among the population. Other\
  \ prisoners are now questioning the guards'' motives, suspecting foul play. Tensions have risen,\
  \ and guards are struggling to keep order in the holding area.
response.2.PARANOIA.button=Ignore their claims. Paranoia is just a side effect of captivity.
response.2.PARANOIA.success={0}, ignoring the prisoner''s claims allowed the situation to resolve\
  \ itself. Over time, their paranoia subsided, and the other prisoners have largely dismissed\
  \ their outbursts. Guards report no further disruptions, and the holding area is calm.
response.2.PARANOIA.failure={0}, ignoring the prisoner''s paranoia was a mistake. Their disruptive\
  \ behavior escalated, and they''ve convinced others to believe their claims. The holding area is\
  \ now rife with tension, and guards report signs of growing unrest among the population.
event.TUNNEL.message={0}, we''ve discovered a half-dug tunnel hidden beneath one of the bunks in the\
  \ holding area. It''s unclear how long they''ve been working on it or how many prisoners are\
  \ involved. We''ve sealed the area for now, but this suggests a coordinated escape attempt.\
  \ Recommend conducting a full sweep of the facility and interrogating key prisoners to uncover\
  \ the extent of the plan. Awaiting your orders.
response.0.TUNNEL.button=Seal it up and monitor the area.
response.0.TUNNEL.success={0}, the tunnel was collapsed and sealed off, sending a clear message to\
  \ the prisoners. Guards have been stationed in the area to ensure no further digging occurs. The\
  \ holding area remains secure, and no additional escape attempts have been reported.
response.0.TUNNEL.failure={0}, collapsing the tunnel angered the prisoners. They saw it as a\
  \ provocation and are now more defiant than ever. Guards report increased hostility, and tensions\
  \ in the holding area are dangerously high.
response.1.TUNNEL.button=Interrogate prisoners to determine who''s responsible.
response.1.TUNNEL.success={0}, interrogating key prisoners revealed the identities of those involved\
  \ in the escape plan. The ringleaders have been isolated, and the remaining prisoners seem\
  \ subdued. Guards report no further signs of coordination, and the holding area is stable.
response.1.TUNNEL.failure={0}, the interrogations yielded no useful information, but they have\
  \ significantly agitated the prisoners. Accusations of harassment are spreading, and tensions in\
  \ the holding area have escalated. Guards are now dealing with increased defiance.
response.2.TUNNEL.button=Use it as bait to catch escapees in the act.
response.2.TUNNEL.success={0}, leaving the tunnel open allowed guards to catch the diggers in the\
  \ act during the night. The prisoners involved were detained, and their tools confiscated. The\
  \ holding area is now secure, and guards are closely monitoring the situation.
response.2.TUNNEL.failure={0}, leaving the tunnel open backfired. The prisoners outmaneuvered the\
  \ guards and used the tunnel to attempt an escape. While they were eventually stopped, the\
  \ incident has emboldened the rest of the population, and tensions in the holding area are now\
  \ dangerously high.
event.PET_RODENT.message={0}, one of the prisoners appears to have tamed a small rodent that''s\
  \ been sneaking into the cells for food. While it seems harmless for now, it''s unusual behavior,\
  \ and we''re concerned it could be used to pass messages or contraband. I''m monitoring the\
  \ situation, but let us know if you want us to take further action.
response.0.PET_RODENT.button=Small comforts might keep morale stable.
response.0.PET_RODENT.success={0}, allowing the prisoner to keep the rodent seems to have improved\
  \ morale. Guards report that the prisoners are calmer, and no signs of contraband or messages\
  \ have been detected. The holding area remains stable, and the situation appears harmless for\
  \ now.
response.0.PET_RODENT.failure={0}, allowing the rodent proved to be a mistake. Guards later\
  \ discovered that the animal was being used to transport small contraband items between cells.\
  \ We''re impressed, but the incident has undermined security, and we''re scrambling to recover\
  \ the smuggled items.
response.1.PET_RODENT.button=The prisoners can''t have unauthorized "pets."
response.1.PET_RODENT.success={0}, the rodent was removed without incident. While the prisoner was\
  \ clearly upset, the rest of the population seems indifferent, and guards report no further\
  \ issues. The holding area remains secure, and morale has stabilized.
response.1.PET_RODENT.failure={0}, confiscating the rodent caused unexpected backlash. The prisoners\
  \ viewed the act as unnecessarily cruel, and tensions in the holding area have increased. Guards\
  \ are now dealing with minor disturbances and defiant behavior.
response.2.PET_RODENT.button=Get rid of all vermin for good. No, that doesn''t mean the prisoners.
response.2.PET_RODENT.success={0}, setting traps eliminated the rodent problem entirely. Guards\
  \ report no further sightings of vermin, and the holding area remains secure. While some\
  \ prisoners grumbled about the decision, the overall mood has stabilized, and no further issues\
  \ have arisen.
response.2.PET_RODENT.failure={0}, setting traps caused significant unrest among the prisoners, who\
  \ viewed the act as petty and oppressive. The prisoner who tamed the rodent is now openly\
  \ defiant, and guards report increased tension in the holding area.
event.ESCAPE_ROPE.message={0}, we''ve just discovered rope-like contraband fashioned from torn\
  \ uniforms hidden in the holding area. It''s unclear how long it''s been in the works or what the\
  \ prisoners were planning to use it for, but it''s likely part of an escape attempt. We''ve\

  \ further contraband has been discovered during follow-up inspections. The situation is under\
  \ control.
response.0.ESCAPE_ROPE.failure={0}, punishing the prisoners caused widespread backlash. The rest of\
  \ the population is now openly defiant, claiming the punishment was excessive. Tensions in the\
  \ holding area are high, and guards are reporting more frequent signs of unrest.
response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.button=Confiscate it quietly and avoid stirring up unrest.
response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.success={0}, the rope-like contraband was confiscated quietly, avoiding\
  \ unnecessary attention. Guards have increased patrols and monitoring, and no further suspicious\
  \ behavior has been observed. The holding area remains stable, and morale is unaffected.
response.1.ESCAPE_ROPE.failure={0}, confiscating the contraband quietly wasn''t enough. The\
  \ prisoners responsible seem emboldened, and guards have reported signs of additional hidden\
  \ items being passed around. The holding area is growing tenser, and the risk of further\
  \ attempts is increasing.
response.2.ESCAPE_ROPE.button=Praise the guard for catching the attempt early.
response.2.ESCAPE_ROPE.success={0}, rewarding the guard for their vigilance boosted morale among\
  \ the staff. The prisoners, meanwhile, appear subdued by the demonstration of authority and\
  \ attentiveness. Guards report that the holding area remains calm, and no further incidents have\
  \ occurred.
response.2.ESCAPE_ROPE.failure={0}, rewarding the guard caused an unexpected backlash among the\

event.UNDERCOVER.message={0}, one of the prisoners is claiming to be an undercover agent working\

response.0.UNDERCOVER.button=Check their story against your records.
response.0.UNDERCOVER.success={0}, verification through Command confirmed the prisoner''s identity\

  \ Guards are maintaining their vigilance, but the situation remains calm.
response.0.UNDERCOVER.failure={0}, attempts to verify the prisoner''s story yielded no matching\
  \ records. The prisoner continues to insist on their role, but it''s clear they''ve fabricated\
  \ the claim. Guards report increased distrust from the other prisoners, who now see the situation\
  \ as a ploy by the staff.
response.1.UNDERCOVER.button=Dismiss them. It''s probably just a ploy for better treatment.
response.1.UNDERCOVER.success={0}, dismissing the prisoner''s claims seems to have defused the\
  \ situation. They''ve stopped insisting on their supposed status, and the other prisoners appear\
  \ to view it as a failed attempt at manipulation. Guards report that the holding area remains\
  \ stable.
response.1.UNDERCOVER.failure={0}, dismissing the claim was a grave mistake. The prisoner was, in\
  \ fact, an undercover agent and the other prisoners must have uncovered the truth. The agent was\
  \ found dead in their cell and the situation in the holding area is rapidly deteriorating.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.button=Put them to the test and see if they have actionable intel.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.success={0}, the prisoner provided actionable intel as a way to prove their\
  \ identity. An allied operation confirmed the information''s accuracy, and we''re in a better\
  \ position tactically than we were prior to the debriefing. Guards are now keeping the situation\
  \ quiet to avoid exposing the agent. The holding area remains secure.
response.2.UNDERCOVER.failure={0}, the prisoner''s so-called "intel" turned out to be false. The\

  \ other prisoners or stir tensions in the holding area. Recommend monitoring the prisoner closely\
  \ and keeping an eye on their interactions. Let us know if further action is needed.
response.0.BRAND.button=Investigate who branded them, and why?
response.0.BRAND.success={0}, the investigation revealed that the scar was self-inflicted as a show\
  \ of loyalty. While the act inspired some prisoners, guards have increased monitoring of the\
  \ prisoner''s interactions, preventing any further incidents. The holding area remains stable for\
  \ now.
response.0.BRAND.failure={0}, the investigation caused unrest among the prisoners, who viewed it as\
  \ an invasion of their personal matters. Tensions in the holding area have escalated, and guards\
  \ report increased hostility from the population. The branded prisoner is now seen as a martyr\
  \ by their peers.
response.1.BRAND.button=Ensure they receive medical attention.
response.1.BRAND.success={0}, the wound was treated by medical personnel, and the gesture seems to\
  \ have calmed the prisoner and those around them. Guards report that the holding area is more\
  \ subdued, and the prisoner''s interactions with others are being closely monitored without\
  \ incident.
response.1.BRAND.failure={0}, treating the wound led to accusations of favoritism from the other\
  \ prisoners. Many now see the branded individual as a symbol of resistance, and tensions in the\
  \ holding area have increased. Guards are reporting signs of coordination among the population.
response.2.BRAND.button=Let the prisoners handle their own business.
response.2.BRAND.success={0}, ignoring the incident has allowed the situation to settle naturally.\
  \ While the branding initially caused a stir, the other prisoners lost interest over time, and\
  \ the holding area has returned to a stable state. Guards are monitoring for any further signs\
  \ of unrest
response.2.BRAND.failure={0}, ignoring the branding was a mistake. The prisoner has gained\
  \ significant influence among their peers, who now view the act as a rallying point. Guards\
  \ report growing solidarity among the prisoners, and the holding area is becoming increasingly\
  \ volatile.
event.SILENCE.message={0}, there''s been an eerie and unusual silence coming from the prisoners''\
  \ holding area. This is out of character, especially given recent behavior. It could indicate\
  \ they''re planning something, or it might just be a rare moment of quiet. Recommend increasing\
  \ patrols and conducting a quick inspection to ensure everything is in order. Let us know how\
  \ you''d like to proceed.
response.0.SILENCE.button=Check on them and ensure everything is in order.
response.0.SILENCE.success={0}, a quick inspection revealed no immediate issues. The prisoners\
  \ appear subdued, possibly reflecting on their situation or simply fatigued. Guards report no\
  \ signs of tampering or coordinated activity, and the holding area remains secure.
response.0.SILENCE.failure={0}, the inspection agitated the prisoners. They accused the guards of\
  \ harassment, and tensions in the holding area have risen. While nothing suspicious was found,\
  \ the atmosphere is now more hostile, and guards are on high alert.
response.1.SILENCE.button=Leave them be. Silence is better than trouble.
response.1.SILENCE.success={0}, leaving the prisoners undisturbed seems to have been the right call.\
  \ The silence persisted for a while before normal activity resumed. Guards report no unusual\
  \ behavior, and the holding area remains calm. It seems to have just been a rare quiet moment.
response.1.SILENCE.failure={0}, choosing not to act allowed the prisoners to coordinate. A sudden\
  \ surge in activity revealed an attempted escape plan, with several prisoners caught trying to\
  \ bypass security. The holding area is now tense, and guards are scrambling to restore order.
response.2.SILENCE.button=Set up surveillance to keep an eye on the situation from a distance.
response.2.SILENCE.success={0}, surveillance confirmed the prisoners were simply resting or\
  \ conserving energy. No signs of coordinated behavior were detected, and the holding area\
  \ remains calm. Guards are maintaining close monitoring, and no further action appears necessary.
response.2.SILENCE.failure={0}, the prisoners noticed the increased surveillance and interpreted it\
  \ as provocation. Tensions in the holding area have risen sharply, and guards report a growing\
  \ sense of unrest among the population.
event.SINGING.message={0}, prisoners from rival groups have started singing together in the holding\
  \ area. While it might seem harmless, this sudden show of unity is unusual and could indicate a\
  \ larger plan or shift in alliances. We''re monitoring the situation closely, but it might be\
  \ worth investigating what prompted this behavior. Let us know if you want us to take any further\
  \ action.
response.0.SINGING.button=Encourage it. Cooperation might keep things calm
response.0.SINGING.success={0}, allowing the singing to continue seems to have had a calming effect\
  \ on the holding area. The unusual unity has reduced tension among the prisoners, and guards\
  \ report no signs of coordinated plans or subversive behavior. The atmosphere is unusually\

response.0.SINGING.failure={0}, encouraging the singing backfired. The prisoners have used the\
  \ newfound unity to coordinate quietly, and guards are reporting subtle signs of an organized\
  \ effort to defy authority. The holding area feels more volatile despite the temporary calm.
response.1.SINGING.button=Disperse them. Unity among prisoners is dangerous
response.1.SINGING.success={0}, dispersing the prisoners before their unity could solidify seems to\
  \ have been the right call. While there was some grumbling, the groups have returned to their\
  \ usual divisions, and guards report no further signs of collaboration. The holding area remains\
  \ secure.
response.1.SINGING.failure={0}, breaking up the singing caused significant unrest. The prisoners\
  \ viewed the action as unnecessary suppression, and their resentment has fueled tension in the\
  \ holding area. Guards report increased hostility and a growing sense of defiance among the\
  \ population.
response.2.SINGING.button=Record it. It could be useful propaganda
response.2.SINGING.success={0}, recording the prisoners'' singing provided valuable insights.\
  \ Analysis of the lyrics revealed no hidden messages or coordination, but the recording could be\
  \ used as propaganda to demoralize enemy factions. The holding area remains stable, and the\
  \ prisoners seem calmer.
response.2.SINGING.failure={0}, recording the singing caused unease among the prisoners, who\
  \ noticed the increased surveillance and interpreted it as an attempt to exploit their actions.\
  \ Tensions have risen, and guards are reporting more frequent confrontations in the holding area.
event.PAPER.message={0}, during a routine cell inspection, we discovered a scrap of paper covered\
  \ in mysterious symbols. We haven''t been able to decipher its meaning yet, but it could be a\
  \ code or some form of communication between prisoners. We''ve confiscated it for analysis and\
  \ recommend monitoring the prisoners closely for any further activity. Let us know if you''d like\
  \ us to prioritize decoding it or take additional steps.
response.0.PAPER.button=Assign someone to figure out its meaning.
response.0.PAPER.success={0}, deciphering the symbols revealed a rudimentary code being used to\
  \ coordinate minor activities among the prisoners. Guards have taken appropriate action to\
  \ disrupt their plans, and the prisoners involved have been isolated. The holding area remains\
  \ secure.
response.0.PAPER.failure={0}, despite our best efforts, the code couldn''t be deciphered in time.\
  \ The prisoners have likely adjusted their plans, and guards are now reporting subtle signs of\
  \ increased coordination. Tensions in the holding area are rising, and the situation remains\
  \ uncertain.
response.1.PAPER.button=Destroy it to eliminate any chance of coordination.
response.1.PAPER.success={0}, the scrap of paper was destroyed, eliminating any potential threat.\
  \ Guards have stepped up monitoring, and no further suspicious activity has been detected. The\
  \ holding area remains calm, and morale among the guards has improved with this swift action.
response.1.PAPER.failure={0}, destroying the paper caused an uproar among the prisoners, who claim\
  \ it was a harmless piece of art. This action has fueled resentment and led to increased\
  \ defiance in the holding area. Guards report a notable rise in hostility.
response.2.PAPER.button=It''s probably meaningless.
response.2.PAPER.success={0}, choosing not to act seems to have been the right decision. The symbols\
  \ turned out to be nothing more than art, and the prisoners have moved on to other distractions.\
  \ The holding area remains stable, and no signs of unrest have emerged.
response.2.PAPER.failure={0}, ignoring the paper was a mistake. Guards later discovered that the\
  \ symbols were part of a larger coordination effort, and by the time it was uncovered, some\
  \ elements of their plan were already in motion. The holding area is now tense, and additional\
  \ measures are being taken.
event.HOLIDAY.message={0}, the prisoners appear to be celebrating a holiday, using improvised\
  \ decorations made from scraps around the holding area. So far, it seems harmless, but it''s\
  \ creating a more festive atmosphere that could either boost morale or encourage group cohesion\
  \ in a way that''s harder to control. Recommend keeping a close watch to ensure the situation\
  \ doesn''t escalate into something disruptive. Let us know if any action is needed.
response.0.HOLIDAY.button=Ban parties. No celebrations in captivity.
response.0.HOLIDAY.success={0}, the celebrations were shut down swiftly and without incident. While\
  \ the prisoners seemed disappointed, guards reported no signs of unrest. The holding area remains\
  \ calm, and the population appears subdued for now.
response.0.HOLIDAY.failure={0}, shutting down the holiday celebrations caused significant backlash.\
  \ The prisoners saw this as an unnecessary act of oppression, and tensions in the holding area\
  \ have increased sharply. Guards are now dealing with more frequent defiance from the population.
response.1.HOLIDAY.button=Allow it. A little morale boost won''t hurt.
response.1.HOLIDAY.success={0}, allowing the celebrations to continue had a surprisingly positive\
  \ effect. The festive atmosphere seems to have improved morale among the prisoners, and guards\
  \ report a more relaxed and cooperative mood in the holding area. No signs of unrest have been\
  \ observed.
response.1.HOLIDAY.failure={0}, allowing the celebrations emboldened the prisoners. The cohesion\
  \ fostered by the event has translated into greater coordination among them, and guards are now\
  \ reporting subtle signs of increased defiance. The holding area is growing more volatile.
response.2.HOLIDAY.button=Use the celebration to extract information.
response.2.HOLIDAY.success={0}, using the celebrations to gather intel proved effective. Guards\
  \ were able to mingle and discreetly extract information about the prisoners'' plans and\
  \ alliances. The holding area remains calm, and the insights gained will strengthen overall\
  \ security.
response.2.HOLIDAY.failure={0}, attempting to exploit the celebrations was seen as intrusive by the\
  \ prisoners. They quickly grew suspicious of the guards'' presence, and the festive atmosphere\
  \ turned tense. Guards report increased hostility, and the holding area feels more unstable.
event.WHISPERS.message={0}, we''ve noticed two prisoners frequently whispering to each other in the\
  \ holding area. While we don''t have details on what they''re discussing, their behavior is\
  \ drawing attention and could indicate planning or coordination. We''re monitoring them closely\
  \ and can separate them if needed. Let us know how you''d like us to handle this.
response.0.WHISPERS.button=Separate them before it turns into a problem.
response.0.WHISPERS.success={0}, the prisoners were separated without incident. Guards report that\
  \ their behavior has returned to normal, and the rest of the holding area remains calm. Whatever\
  \ they were planning, it seems to have been disrupted before it could escalate.
response.0.WHISPERS.failure={0}, separating the prisoners caused unrest in the holding area. Other\
  \ prisoners viewed the move as heavy-handed, and tensions have risen. The separated individuals\
  \ are now attempting to rally support from their peers, making the situation more volatile.
response.1.WHISPERS.button=Try to learn what they''re planning.
response.1.WHISPERS.success={0}, eavesdropping on the prisoners revealed discussions of an escape\
  \ plan. Guards intervened before the plan could be set in motion, and the prisoners involved have\
  \ been isolated. The holding area remains secure, and morale among the staff has improved with\
  \ this proactive action.
response.1.WHISPERS.failure={0}, the attempt to eavesdrop was detected, and the prisoners\
  \ immediately stopped talking. Their suspicion has spread to the rest of the population,\
  \ increasing paranoia and hostility. Guards report heightened tension in the holding area as a\
  \ result.
response.2.WHISPERS.button=Let it go. Alliances sometimes form under strange circumstances.
response.2.WHISPERS.success={0}, ignoring the whispers turned out to be the right choice. The\
  \ prisoners were simply discussing personal matters, and their behavior has since normalized.\
  \ Guards report no signs of coordinated activity, and the holding area remains calm.
response.2.WHISPERS.failure={0}, letting the situation go unchecked backfired. The two prisoners\
  \ were coordinating an effort to disrupt operations, and their plans are now in motion. Guards\
  \ are scrambling to contain the situation, and the holding area is growing increasingly unstable.
event.LEADER.message={0}, one of the prisoners appears to have significant influence over the others,\
  \ despite speaking very little. Their presence alone seems to command respect or compliance,\
  \ which could be a concern if tensions escalate. We''re keeping an eye on their interactions, but\
  \ this individual might warrant closer monitoring or isolation if their influence becomes\
  \ disruptive. Let us know your orders.
response.0.LEADER.button=Interrogate them. Find out what makes them so respected.
response.0.LEADER.success={0}, the interrogation revealed that the prisoner''s influence stems from\
  \ their leadership during previous campaigns. The guards were able to glean valuable information\
  \ about the prisoner''s background and potential plans, and their influence has diminished after\
  \ being publicly questioned. The holding area remains calm.
response.0.LEADER.failure={0}, the interrogation backfired. The prisoner refused to cooperate, and\
  \ their defiance only strengthened their standing among the others. Guards report increased\
  \ solidarity among the prisoners, and tensions in the holding area are rising.
response.1.LEADER.button=Isolate them to weaken their influence.
response.1.LEADER.success={0}, isolating the influential prisoner successfully disrupted their sway\
  \ over the others. Without their presence, the prisoners seem disorganized and less defiant.\
  \ Guards report a noticeable decrease in tension, and the holding area remains secure.
response.1.LEADER.failure={0}, isolating the prisoner caused significant unrest. The other\
  \ prisoners now view them as a martyr, and their influence has grown even in isolation. Guards\
  \ report heightened defiance and a growing sense of unity among the population.
response.2.LEADER.button=Observe quietly. See how the dynamic develops.
response.2.LEADER.success={0}, quiet observation revealed no immediate signs of disruption. The\
  \ prisoner''s influence seems passive rather than active, and guards have been able to\
  \ maintain order without interference. The holding area remains stable, and the situation is\
  \ under control.
response.2.LEADER.failure={0}, observing quietly allowed the prisoner to consolidate their\
  \ influence further. Guards are now reporting subtle but coordinated actions among the prisoners,\
  \ suggesting the influential individual is organizing them covertly. The holding area is becoming\
  \ increasingly volatile.
event.ARGUMENTS.message={0}, two of my guards have been openly arguing over how to handle the\

response.0.ARGUMENTS.button=Resolve the issue diplomatically.
response.0.ARGUMENTS.success={0}, mediating the argument allowed both guards to express their\
  \ perspectives and find common ground. The discussion ended on a positive note, and team morale\
  \ has noticeably improved. Guards are working more cohesively, and the holding area remains\
  \ secure.
response.0.ARGUMENTS.failure={0}, the mediation attempt failed. Neither guard was willing to back\
  \ down, and the unresolved tension is now affecting the rest of the team. Guards are distracted,\
  \ and morale has taken a hit, putting the security of the holding area at risk.
response.1.ARGUMENTS.button=End the feud by reassigning one of them.
response.1.ARGUMENTS.success={0}, reassigning one of the guards effectively ended the feud. Both\
  \ individuals seem more focused in their new roles, and the rest of the team has returned to\
  \ normal operations. Morale is stable, and the holding area remains secure.
response.1.ARGUMENTS.failure={0}, reassigning one of the guards created resentment. The reassigned\
  \ individual feels unfairly punished, and rumors of favoritism are spreading among the team.\
  \ Morale has dropped, and cohesion among the guards has been compromised.
response.2.ARGUMENTS.button=Let them sort it out. It''s not your job to babysit.
response.2.ARGUMENTS.success={0}, allowing the guards to resolve their dispute on their own proved\
  \ effective. They reached an understanding after a heated discussion, and the team is back on\
  \ track. Morale has stabilized, and operations in the holding area continue without issue.
response.2.ARGUMENTS.failure={0}, leaving the guards to sort it out only worsened the situation.\
  \ Their feud has escalated into open hostility, and the team is now divided. The holding area is\
  \ less secure, and guards are distracted from their duties, creating a potential risk.
event.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.message={0}, one of the prisoners is pleading for the return of a small,\
  \ personal item that was confiscated during intake. They claim it has sentimental value, but\

  \ your orders.
response.0.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.button=Allow them to keep the sentimental item.
response.0.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.success={0}, the item was returned to the prisoner after ensuring it\
  \ posed no security risk. The gesture seems to have eased tensions in the holding area, and the\
  \ other prisoners appear less agitated. Guards report improved morale among the population, and\
  \ the situation remains stable.
response.0.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.failure={0}, returning the item was a mistake. It was later discovered\
  \ that the item was being used to pass messages to other prisoners, undermining security. Guards\
  \ are scrambling to contain the fallout, and tensions in the holding area have risen sharply.
response.1.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.button=Deny the request. No exceptions.
response.1.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.success={0}, denying the request sent a clear message that security\
  \ protocols would not be compromised. While the prisoner seemed upset, the rest of the population\
  \ appears indifferent, and no further similar requests have been made. The holding area remains\
  \ secure.
response.1.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.failure={0}, denying the request caused unrest among the prisoners, who\
  \ now view the decision as unnecessarily cruel. Guards report increased hostility and subtle\
  \ signs of defiance in the holding area, making the situation more volatile.
response.2.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.button=Investigate the item. Ensure it''s not more than it seems.
response.2.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.success={0}, the item was thoroughly inspected and confirmed to be\
  \ harmless. Returning it to the prisoner eased tensions without compromising security. Guards\
  \ report that the holding area remains calm, and the population is more cooperative overall.
response.2.SENTIMENTAL_ITEM.failure={0}, the investigation revealed that the item contained a\

  \ reaction has caused an uproar, with other prisoners rallying in protest. Tensions in the\
  \ holding area have escalated.
event.MALNUTRITION.message={0}, during roll call, a prisoner collapsed due to severe malnutrition.\
  \ Upon investigation, another prisoner confessed to stealing rations from the weaker ones to\

response.0.MALNUTRITION.success={0}, punishing the thief sent a clear message that such behavior\

  \ has been restored in the holding area. The malnourished prisoner is receiving medical attention\
  \ and is expected to recover.
response.0.MALNUTRITION.failure={0}, punishing the thief backfired. The other prisoners viewed it\
  \ as excessive and have begun to rally around the individual, claiming the guards are showing\

  \ hostility.
response.1.MALNUTRITION.button=Survival of the fittest is the rule in war.
response.1.MALNUTRITION.success={0}, choosing not to act has allowed the situation to resolve\

  \ of ration theft have been reported. Guards report that tensions have eased, and the holding\
  \ area remains stable.
response.1.MALNUTRITION.failure={0}, ignoring the issue has worsened the situation. The thief''s\
  \ behavior has emboldened others, and guards report a surge in thefts and conflicts over\

  \ dropping.
response.2.MALNUTRITION.button=Risk depleting your own stores to provide more food for all prisoners.
response.2.MALNUTRITION.success={0}, providing extra rations has calmed the holding area\
  \ significantly. The malnourished prisoner is recovering, and the other prisoners seem more\
  \ cooperative, appreciating the gesture. Guards report that tensions have subsided, and order has\
  \ been restored.
response.2.MALNUTRITION.failure={0}, sharing extra rations backfired. The prisoners now view it as\
  \ a sign of weakness, and thefts have continued despite the increased food supply. Guards are\

response.0.INJURIES.button=Crack down on the prisoner hierarchy and find the culprit.
response.0.INJURIES.success={0}, the investigation uncovered the assailant, who has been isolated\

response.1.INJURIES.button=The prisoners have their own form of justice - don''t interfere.
response.1.INJURIES.success={0}, leaving the situation alone allowed tensions to settle naturally.\
  \ The prisoners seem to have handled the matter internally, and no further violence has been\
  \ reported. Guards are keeping a close watch, but the holding area remains stable for now.
response.1.INJURIES.failure={0}, ignoring the incident backfired. The lack of intervention has\
  \ emboldened the prisoners, who see it as permission to enforce their own brand of justice.\
  \ Violence among the population has increased, and the holding area is becoming more dangerous\
  \ for both guards and prisoners.
response.2.INJURIES.button=Increase guard presence to prevent further violence.
response.2.INJURIES.success={0}, increasing guard patrols has had a calming effect on the prisoners.\
  \ The heightened presence has deterred further violence. Guards report that the holding area is\

response.2.TERROR.button=Use their mental state to extract intelligence or compliance.
response.2.TERROR.success={0}, exploiting the prisoners'' mental state yielded valuable intelligence.\

response.2.PHOTO.failure={0}, using the photo as leverage caused an uproar among the prisoners.\

  \ immediate reinforcements to contain this, or they''re going to overwhelm us! Awaiting your\
  \ orders!
response.0.BREAKOUT.button=Focus on preventing any prisoners from leaving the base, even if it\
  \ costs lives.
response.0.BREAKOUT.success={0}, the perimeter lockdown was successful. No prisoners managed to\
  \ escape, though the operation was intense, with some guards sustaining injuries. The breach\
  \ has been secured, and the facility is back under control. The prisoners have been subdued, and\
  \ order has been restored.
response.0.BREAKOUT.failure={0}, despite our efforts to lock down the perimeter, many prisoners\
  \ managed to slip through in the chaos. The guards sustained heavy casualties holding the line,\
  \ and the breach caused significant damage. While the immediate threat has been contained, the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for, and morale among the team is low.
response.1.BREAKOUT.button=Send guards and combat units after fleeing prisoners at full force,\
  \ risking significant casualties.
response.1.BREAKOUT.success={0}, the aggressive pursuit paid off. The majority of the escapees have\
  \ been recaptured, and the rest were neutralized. The operation was costly, with several guards\
  \ injured, but the breakout has been thwarted. Order is restored, and the remaining prisoners are\
  \ under control.
response.1.BREAKOUT.failure={0}, the aggressive pursuit failed. The escapees scattered in multiple\
  \ directions, overwhelming our forces. Several guards were lost or injured in the pursuit, and a\
  \ significant number of prisoners is still at large. The breach has been secured, but the\
  \ breakout''s impact will take time to recover from.
response.2.BREAKOUT.button=Focus on containing the remaining prisoners even if some escape.
response.2.BREAKOUT.success={0}, cutting our losses allowed us to focus on securing the remaining\
  \ prisoners and minimizing casualties. While some prisoners escaped, the breach has been\
  \ repaired, and the facility is stable. The guards are regrouping, and the remaining population\
  \ has been subdued.
response.2.BREAKOUT.failure={0}, cutting our losses only emboldened the prisoners. While we secured\
  \ the remaining population, the number of escapees was higher than expected. The facility is\
  \ intact, but morale among the guards has plummeted, and tensions are high among the remaining\
  \ prisoners. Stability is fragile at best.
event.RIOT.message={0}, the prisoners have erupted into a full-scale riot! They''ve armed\
  \ themselves with makeshift weapons - pipes, sharp tools, even shards of metal ripped from the\
  \ holding area. We''ve fallen back to the control room. The barricades won''t hold for long, and\
  \ they''re trying to force their way in! We need backup and orders immediately, or we''re going\
  \ to lose control of the entire facility!
response.0.RIOT.button=Use stun weapons and tear gas to bring the prisoners under control.
response.0.RIOT.success={0}, the riot suppression teams successfully subdued the prisoners. Stun\
  \ weapons and tear gas brought the situation under control, and all hostiles have been\
  \ restrained. There were injuries on both sides, but no major casualties. The facility is\
  \ secure, and order has been fully restored.
response.0.RIOT.failure={0}, the riot suppression teams were overwhelmed. The prisoners resisted\
  \ tear gas and makeshift barricades, overrunning critical areas before retreating guards could\
  \ regroup. Many guards sustained injuries, and the holding area has suffered significant\
  \ damage. The riot has been quelled, but the aftermath will require a full assessment.
response.1.RIOT.button=Deploy combat units to decisively end the riot, even if it means\
  \ significant bloodshed.
response.1.RIOT.success={0}, reinforcements successfully ended the riot. The combat units acted\
  \ decisively, overpowering the prisoners and restoring full control of the facility. There were\
  \ some injuries among the prisoners, including several casualties, but the situation is resolved,\
  \ and the facility is secure once more.
response.1.RIOT.failure={0}, reinforcements engaged the prisoners, but the riot escalated further\
  \ before it could be stopped. Heavy fighting caused significant damage to the facility, and\
  \ multiple injuries were reported on both sides. While control has been regained, the cost was\
  \ high, and parts of the compound are heavily compromised.
response.2.RIOT.button=Promise improved conditions to quell the violence, knowing it might\
  \ embolden the prisoners later.
response.2.RIOT.success={0}, the prisoners accepted the terms of surrender, and the riot has been\
  \ defused. They disarmed and returned to their cells after receiving assurances of improved\
  \ conditions. While the situation is under control, tensions in the facility remain high, and the\
  \ guards are on edge following the incident.
response.2.RIOT.failure={0}, the prisoners rejected the terms of surrender and escalated their\
  \ assault before the riot was finally subdued. They seized additional sections of the facility\
  \ and inflicted serious damage before eventually being overpowered. While the immediate threat\
  \ has passed, the holding area is left in disarray.
event.MURDER.message={0}, we''ve found a prisoner dead in their cell - murdered! The other\
  \ prisoners are furious, and they''re blaming us for letting this happen. They''re threatening\
  \ revenge unless the killer is identified immediately! Tensions are about to explode - we need\
  \ instructions on how to defuse this before it turns into a bloodbath!
response.0.MURDER.button=Dedicate resources to finding the murderer and addressing prisoner\
  \ grievances.
response.0.MURDER.success={0}, the investigation was a success. The murderer was identified and\
  \ taken into custody, and the other prisoners are satisfied that justice has been served. While\
  \ tensions remain, the swift and thorough response has calmed the situation. The facility is\
  \ stable, and order has been restored.
response.0.MURDER.failure={0}, the investigation failed to uncover the murderer. Despite our\
  \ efforts, the lack of results has only fueled prisoner anger, and their distrust in us has\
  \ deepened. While the immediate violence has subsided, tensions remain dangerously high, and the\
  \ prisoners are still on edge.
response.1.MURDER.button=Pin the murder on a convenient suspect to restore order quickly, even if\
  \ they''re innocent.
response.1.MURDER.success={0}, a convenient suspect was blamed for the murder, and the prisoners\
  \ accepted the explanation. The scapegoat was removed from the population, and tensions have\
  \ eased significantly. While the situation is now under control, some guards have voiced concerns\
  \ about the ethics of this decision.
response.1.MURDER.failure={0}, the attempt to blame a scapegoat backfired. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the ruse and are more furious than ever. They believe we''re hiding the real murderer,\
  \ and their demands for justice have escalated. Order has been restored for now, but the unrest\
  \ is far from over.
response.2.MURDER.button=Crack down hard on the other prisoners, regardless of whether they were\
  \ involved.
response.2.MURDER.success={0}, a harsh crackdown on the prisoners has restored order. While many\
  \ of them are bitter about the collective punishment, the display of authority has subdued any\
  \ immediate threats. The facility is secure, though tensions remain beneath the surface.
response.2.MURDER.failure={0}, the crackdown sparked even more chaos. The prisoners resisted\
  \ fiercely, resulting in widespread injuries and significant damage to the facility. While the\
  \ riot has been quelled, the cost was high, and the population is now even more defiant. Order\
  \ has been restored, but the situation remains volatile.
event.FIRE.message={0}, a fire has broken out in one of the prisoner cellblocks! We''re scrambling\
  \ to respond, but we''re struggling to contain the blaze. Prisoners are screaming for help as the\
  \ flames spread - some are trying to break free in the chaos, while others are turning on each\
  \ other to survive. The cause of the fire is still unclear - could be an accident or sabotage. We\
  \ need immediate orders on how to prioritize containment, rescues, and security!
response.0.FIRE.button=Focus your efforts on rescuing prisoners and guards, even if it means\
  \ losing critical resources or risking a breakout.
response.0.FIRE.success={0}, we prioritized rescues, and many prisoners and guards were saved from\
  \ the blaze. Though we lost some critical resources and sustained damage to the facility, the\
  \ majority of lives were spared. The fire has been extinguished, and order is being\
  \ reestablished. While the situation was costly, the effort has restored some trust among the\
  \ prisoners.
response.0.FIRE.failure={0}, despite our best efforts to rescue as many as possible, the fire\
  \ spread too quickly. Several prisoners and guards couldn''t be saved, and critical resources\
  \ were destroyed in the chaos. While the blaze is now extinguished, the loss of life and damage\
  \ to the facility have left morale in shambles.
response.1.FIRE.button=Lock down the camp to prevent any escape attempts, even if it means\
  \ sacrificing lives in the cellblock.
response.1.FIRE.success={0}, the perimeter has been secured, and no prisoners managed to escape\
  \ during the chaos. While several prisoners perished in the fire, the facility remains intact,\
  \ and critical infrastructure has been preserved. Order has been restored, but the loss of life\
  \ has heightened tensions within the population.
response.1.FIRE.failure={0}, we locked down the perimeter, but the decision came at a heavy cost.\
  \ Many prisoners and even some guards succumbed to the fire while we focused on security, and\
  \ critical parts of the facility were severely damaged. While no one escaped, the backlash among\
  \ the surviving prisoners is intense, and trust in our leadership has eroded.
response.2.FIRE.button=Prioritize finding the source of the fire - sabotage could indicate a\
  \ larger conspiracy among the prisoners.
response.2.FIRE.success={0}, we prioritized investigating the fire and uncovered evidence of\
  \ deliberate sabotage by a faction of prisoners. While the delay in response meant more lives and\
  \ resources were lost, the discovery of this plot has allowed us to identify key culprits and\
  \ prevent future incidents. The fire is extinguished, and the perpetrators have been detained.
response.2.FIRE.failure={0}, the investigation delayed our response to the fire, resulting in\
  \ significant loss of life and damage to the facility. To make matters worse, we found no\
  \ conclusive evidence of sabotage, and the cause of the fire remains uncertain. The surviving\
  \ prisoners are furious, and the facility is in disarray. This failure has only added fuel to the\
  \ unrest.
event.POISON.message={0}, several personnel have fallen ill - turns out their rations were\
  \ poisoned! Investigation reveals a prisoner managed to sabotage the supply lines, and we have\
  \ reason to believe there''s more poison hidden somewhere. The affected personnel aren''t in a\
  \ critical condition, but panic is spreading. We need immediate instructions to secure the\
  \ supplies and contain this threat before it gets worse!
response.0.POISON.button=Halt all meals temporarily and investigate thoroughly.
response.0.POISON.success={0}, food distribution was immediately halted, and a thorough\
  \ investigation uncovered additional poisoned food supplies. The prisoners were angered by the\
  \ disruption, but no further cases of poisoning occurred, and panic has subsided. Security\
  \ protocols have been reinforced, and the situation is now under control.
response.0.POISON.failure={0}, shutting down food distribution caused widespread disruption,\
  \ sparking unrest and even minor skirmishes in the holding area. Despite this, we failed to\
  \ locate additional poison in the supply. Tensions remain high.
response.1.POISON.button=Identify and punish a likely suspect to deter further attempts.
response.1.POISON.success={0}, the suspected saboteur was identified and punished. The decisive\
  \ action has sent a clear message to the prisoners, deterring further attempts to sabotage our\
  \ rations. The situation has calmed, and food distribution has resumed under tighter security\
  \ measures. Panic has been contained, and the affected personnel are recovering.
response.1.POISON.failure={0}, punishing the suspected saboteur backfired - our evidence was\
  \ inconclusive, and the prisoners are now accusing us of scapegoating. Distrust has spread, and\
  \ some personnel are refusing their rations entirely. The base remains on edge, and tensions are\
  \ rising.
response.2.POISON.button=Focus on longer-term security measures while addressing the immediate crisis.
response.2.POISON.success={0}, food inspections were ramped up immediately, and we identified and\
  \ removed several poisoned rations from circulation. While the process delayed food distribution,\
  \ it reassured the prisoners and guards alike. The affected personnel are recovering, and the\
  \ enhanced security measures have stabilized the situation.
response.2.POISON.failure={0}, increased food inspections failed to uncover any additional poison,\
  \ and the delays in distribution only added to the tension. Some personnel are accusing us of\
  \ negligence. The threat of further sabotage remains unresolved, and morale is low across the\
  \ base.
event.HOSTAGE.message={0}, we have an emergency! During a routine inspection, a group of prisoners\
  \ overpowered my guards and has taken one of them hostage! They''re demanding better conditions\
  \ and immediate release, threatening to kill the hostage if their demands aren''t met. The\
  \ situation is extremely volatile, and we don''t know how long we have to negotiate. We need your\
  \ orders immediately!
response.0.HOSTAGE.button=Stall the prisoners with minor concessions while preparing a rescue\
  \ operation.
response.0.HOSTAGE.success={0}, the negotiations bought us enough time to organize a successful\
  \ rescue operation. The hostage was freed with only minor injuries, and the prisoners involved\
  \ have been subdued and detained. While the situation was tense, the outcome was a success, and\
  \ order has been restored.
response.0.HOSTAGE.failure={0}, the negotiations stalled, and the prisoners used the delay to\
  \ reinforce their position. By the time we attempted the rescue, they executed the hostage and\
  \ inflicted heavy casualties on the assault team. The situation has been resolved, but at a\
  \ devastating cost.
response.1.HOSTAGE.button=Launch a risky assault to save the hostage, regardless of casualties.
response.1.HOSTAGE.success={0}, the assault team acted swiftly, overwhelming the prisoners and\
  \ rescuing the hostage. While there were injuries during the operation, the hostage was recovered\
  \ alive, and the prisoners responsible have been secured. The operation was a success, and the\
  \ facility is under control once again.
response.1.HOSTAGE.failure={0}, the assault to rescue the hostage failed. The prisoners killed the\
  \ hostage during the attack, and several guards were injured or killed in the chaos. Although the\
  \ prisoners were eventually subdued, the cost was high, and morale among the security team has\
  \ plummeted. The facility is secure, but the scars from this event will linger.
response.2.HOSTAGE.button=Take a hardline stance, knowing the hostage''s life may be lost.
response.2.HOSTAGE.success={0}, taking a hardline stance paid off. The prisoners hesitated and\
  \ ultimately released the hostage unharmed, fearing retaliation. The guards quickly subdued the\
  \ ringleaders, and the situation has been resolved without bloodshed. While tensions remain high,\
  \ the facility is stable, and our authority has been reinforced.
response.2.HOSTAGE.failure={0}, refusing their demands led to the worst outcome. The prisoners\
  \ executed the hostage and escalated their defiance, forcing guards to intervene with deadly\
  \ force. The situation was ultimately contained, but the loss of life and the display of\
  \ violence have left the facility in a state of shock.
event.BOMB.message={0}, a prisoner-planted explosive just detonated in a critical part of the\
  \ facility - the power generator has been hit! Systems are failing, and the blast has\
  \ thrown everything into chaos. The prisoners are using the confusion to launch a coordinated\
  \ attack and attempt a breakout! We''re under heavy assault and barely holding the line. We need\
  \ reinforcements and immediate orders before the situation spirals completely out of control!
response.0.BOMB.button=Focus on protecting vital systems to prevent further damage, even if\
  \ prisoners escape.
response.0.BOMB.success={0}, critical areas of the facility have been secured. While a few\
  \ prisoners managed to escape during the chaos, the guards successfully protected vital systems,\
  \ preventing further damage. The power generator is offline but intact enough to be repaired. The\
  \ situation is now under control, and the facility''s stability has been preserved.
response.0.BOMB.failure={0}, we focused on securing critical systems, but the effort came at a cost.\
  \ A large group of prisoners managed to escape in the confusion, and damage to the generator is\
  \ extensive. While the immediate threat has been contained, the facility is in disarray, and the\
  \ escapees are unaccounted for.
response.1.BOMB.button=Send guards after the responsible prisoners, prioritizing retribution over\
  \ security.
response.1.BOMB.success={0}, the guards tracked down and captured the saboteurs behind the\
  \ explosion. Their capture has prevented further coordinated attacks, though the effort left\
  \ other parts of the facility vulnerable. The damage to the generator is extensive, but with the\
  \ ringleaders in custody, the prisoners'' momentum has been crushed, and order is being restored.
response.1.BOMB.failure={0}, pursuing the saboteurs backfired. While the guards managed to apprehend\
  \ some of them, the delay in securing vital systems allowed the breakout to spiral out of\
  \ control. Many prisoners escaped, and the generator sustained catastrophic damage. The situation\
  \ is under control for now, but the losses are severe.
response.2.BOMB.button=Bring in additional manpower to handle the chaos, though it may leave other\
  \ areas vulnerable.
response.2.BOMB.success={0}, reinforcements arrived just in time to help contain the breakout and\
  \ stabilize the facility. The coordinated attack was repelled, and the majority of the prisoners\
  \ involved have been subdued or recaptured. The generator is damaged, but the facility is secure,\
  \ and order has been restored.
response.2.BOMB.failure={0}, reinforcements arrived too late to prevent widespread chaos. By the\
  \ time they intervened, significant damage had been done to the generator, and many prisoners had\
  \ already escaped. While the facility has been stabilized, the aftermath of the breakout will\
  \ take considerable time and resources to address.
event.EXECUTION.message={0}, we''ve got a crisis - prisoners just carried out a public execution in\
  \ the holding area, claiming the victim was a collaborator. By the time we arrived, it was too\
  \ late to stop it. Now the prisoners are openly defiant, treating this as a show of strength.\
  \ Tensions are boiling over, and the situation could escalate into full-scale violence at any\
  \ moment. We need orders immediately - how do we contain this?
response.0.EXECUTION.button=Identify and publicly punish those responsible to reassert control.
response.0.EXECUTION.success={0}, the mob leaders were identified and swiftly punished, sending a\
  \ clear message to the rest of the prisoners. While tensions remain high, the show of authority\
  \ has reasserted control over the population. The situation has been stabilized, and no further\
  \ violence has occurred.
response.0.EXECUTION.failure={0}, our attempt to punish the mob leaders backfired. The prisoners\
  \ retaliated violently, escalating the situation into a full-blown riot. Several guards were\
  \ injured, and parts of the facility sustained damage before order was finally restored. The\
  \ aftermath has left the facility on edge and resources stretched thin.
response.1.EXECUTION.button=Separate prisoners based on alliances to reduce tensions, even if it\
  \ spreads your resources thin.
response.1.EXECUTION.success={0}, faction leaders were identified, and the prisoners were divided\
  \ and isolated based on their alliances. The separation has reduced tensions significantly,\
  \ preventing further outbreaks of violence. While the approach has stretched our resources,\
  \ the facility is now stable, and control has been reestablished.
response.1.EXECUTION.failure={0}, dividing the prisoners only created new flash points, as tensions\
  \ flared within the isolated groups. The strain on our resources made it difficult to maintain\
  \ order, and skirmishes broke out across multiple sections of the facility. The situation has\
  \ been contained, but the fractures among the population remain volatile.
response.2.EXECUTION.button=Let the execution stand as a grim reminder of what would happen if the\
  \ guards weren''t around.
response.2.EXECUTION.success={0}, we let the execution stand as a warning to the population, and\
  \ the grim  message seems to have worked. The prisoners are subdued, recognizing the consequences\
  \ of defiance. While this approach has left lingering unease, the facility is secure, and no\
  \ further incidents have occurred.
response.2.EXECUTION.failure={0}, treating the execution as a warning backfired. Instead of\
  \ deterring unrest, it emboldened the prisoners, who now view it as a victory. Defiance is\
  \ spreading, and tensions in the facility are at an all-time high. While the situation hasn''t\
  \ escalated into open violence yet, it''s dangerously close.
event.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.message={0}, we''ve just uncovered a horrifying situation - a neglected wing\
  \ of the compound was rediscovered after prisoners were mistakenly transferred there during a\
  \ chaotic intake process. Guards found emaciated bodies, skeletal prisoners barely clinging to\
  \ life, and others who didn''t survive. The survivors are pleading for rescue and accusing us of\
  \ abandoning them. This could spiral into chaos if word spreads further. We need immediate orders\
  \ on how to handle this before it turns into a full-blown crisis.
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.button=Dedicate resources to saving the survivors, even if it strains\
  \ your supplies.
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.success={0}, immediate aid was provided to the survivors, stabilizing\
  \ their condition. While this strained our supplies and personnel, the effort has quelled\
  \ accusations and restored a measure of trust among the prisoners. The situation has been\
  \ contained, and morale is recovering, though resources remain tight.
response.0.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.failure={0}, despite our efforts to provide aid, it was too late for\
  \ many of the prisoners. The survivors are resentful and spreading accusations of negligence,\
  \ fueling unrest in the facility. The strain on our supplies has left us vulnerable, and tensions\
  \ are rising among both prisoners and staff.
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.button=Quietly cover up the incident to prevent political fallout.
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.success={0}, the incident was quietly covered up. The bodies were\
  \ removed, and the surviving prisoners were integrated back into the general population under\
  \ close observation. No information has leaked, and the situation has been contained without\
  \ further fallout. The facility remains stable.
response.1.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.failure={0}, the attempt to cover up the incident failed. Word spread\
  \ among the prisoners before we could act, and now the population is furious, accusing us of\
  \ hiding atrocities. The backlash has destabilized the facility, and maintaining control will be\
  \ challenging in the days ahead.
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.button=Shift responsibility for the disaster onto the prisoners\
  \ themselves to maintain control over the remaining population.
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.success={0}, shifting responsibility to the prisoners has diffused\
  \ blame from our crew. By framing the incident as a result of infighting and poor organization\
  \ among the prisoners, we''ve avoided further accusations. While tensions remain, the population\
  \ is subdued, and the facility is stable for now.
response.2.ABANDONED_TO_DIE.failure={0}, blaming the prisoners only inflamed the situation. The\
  \ survivors and their allies have become openly defiant, accusing us of cruelty and negligence.\
  \ The unrest is spreading, and the situation is dangerously close to spiraling out of control.\
  \ The facility is on edge, and stability is tenuous.
event.UNITED.message={0}, we''ve got a major crisis - prisoners from rival groups have set aside\
  \ their differences and formed a united front against us! Their cooperation has allowed them to\
  \ overwhelm my guards and seize control of an entire holding wing. They''re fortifying their\
  \ position and could spread further if we don''t act fast. We need clear orders on how to retake\
  \ the area before this escalates even more!
response.0.UNITED.button=Exploit old rivalries to shatter the alliance from within.
response.0.UNITED.success={0}, we exploited old rivalries among the prisoners, planting rumors and\
  \ sowing distrust within their alliance. The united front shattered as factions turned on each\
  \ other, allowing guards to retake the holding wing with minimal resistance. The facility is\
  \ secure, and tensions among the prisoners are back to manageable levels.
response.0.UNITED.failure={0}, our attempts to divide the alliance failed. The prisoners saw\
  \ through the ploy and grew even more unified against us. They''ve tightened their defenses, and\
  \ regaining the holding wing required significant force.
response.1.UNITED.button=Retake the area with overwhelming force, even if it costs lives.
response.1.UNITED.success={0}, the full assault succeeded. Guards overwhelmed the prisoners with\
  \ decisive force, retaking the holding wing. While there were casualties on both sides, the\
  \ operation reestablished control over the area, and the remaining prisoners have been subdued.\
  \ The facility is stable once again.
response.1.UNITED.failure={0}, the full assault failed. The prisoners were heavily fortified, and\
  \ the guards suffered significant casualties during the operation. Despite this, they were\
  \ successful, and the holding wing is back under our control.
response.2.UNITED.button=Seal the wing and starve the prisoners of resources, forcing them to\
  \ surrender over time.
response.2.UNITED.success={0}, we sealed off the holding wing, cutting the prisoners off from\
  \ resources and reinforcements. Over time, their supplies dwindled, and they were forced to\
  \ surrender. The operation was a success, with minimal casualties, and the facility is back under\
  \ our control.
response.2.UNITED.failure={0}, cutting off the holding wing backfired. The prisoners found ways to\
  \ fortify their position and scavenged resources to sustain themselves. Meanwhile, unrest spread\
  \ among the rest of the population, who viewed this as proof of our cruelty. The situation was\
  \ deteriorating rapidly, and the facility''s stability at risk, so I authorized a full assault.\
  \ The assault was successful, but not without casualties.

prisoners.player.victory.good.2={0}, our previously captured personnel have been retrieved by\
  \ allied forces and are now in stable condition. Medical and intelligence teams are conducting\
  \ evaluations. A follow-up report with relevant findings and recommendations will be delivered\
  \ shortly.
prisoners.player.victory.good.3={0}, Allied Command confirms the successful extraction of our\
  \ personnel from enemy custody. All individuals are currently in transit to a secure medical\
  \ facility for immediate assessment. No further action required at this time unless directed\
  \ otherwise.
prisoners.player.victory.good.4={0}, recovered personnel have been secured and are receiving\
  \ medical treatment. No operational updates at this time. Allied Command has requested a liaison\
  \ for debriefing once their conditions allow. I will follow up with further details as they\
  \ become available.
prisoners.player.victory.good.5={0}, we just got word - our people are safe. Allied Command pulled\
  \ them out, and they''re getting medical attention as we speak. It''s been a long wait, but we\
  \ finally have them back. No details yet on their condition, but they''re alive. That''s what\
  \ matters right now.
prisoners.player.victory.good.6=Good news, {0} - our missing personnel have been rescued! Allied\
  \ Command came through, and they''re bringing them home. We don''t have the full picture yet, but\
  \ they made it out. After everything, I wasn''t sure we''d see them again. This is a damn good day.
prisoners.player.victory.good.7=They did it, {0}. Allied forces got our people back. No casualties,\
  \ no more unknowns - they''re safe. Medical teams are checking them over, and we''ll know more soon,\
  \ but at least we can stop wondering. We can bring them home.
prisoners.player.victory.good.8={0}, we''ve got our people back. Allied Command pulled off the\
  \ rescue, and from the first reports, they all survived. I can''t tell you how good it feels to\
  \ say that. We''ll know more soon, but for now, I just wanted you to know - we didn''t lose them.
prisoners.player.victory.good.9=I just got confirmation, {0} - our captured personnel have been found\
  \ and rescued. They''re on their way to a secure facility, and from what we''re hearing, they''re in\
  \ stable condition. We''ve been waiting for this moment, and now it''s finally here. We''ll bring\
  \ them home soon.
prisoners.player.victory.good.10={0}, Allied Command recovered our people, but they''re different.\
  \ Medical is assessing them now, but captivity leaves scars beyond the physical. We need to be\
  \ prepared - for their sake and ours. Some may return to duty, but others... we''ll have to wait and\
  \ see.
prisoners.player.victory.good.11={0}, they''re back, but it''s not a victory yet. Allied forces\
  \ pulled them out, but we don''t know what shape they''re in. No word on injuries, no word on what\
  \ they endured. We''ll get the reports soon, but don''t expect them to just pick up where they left\
  \ off.
prisoners.player.victory.good.12={0}, our people have been recovered, but survival doesn''t mean\
  \ they''re whole. Allied Command is handling their medical care, but I''ve seen cases like this\
  \ before. They''ll need more than just time to heal. We should be ready for whatever comes next.
prisoners.player.victory.good.13={0}, they made it out, but we have to be realistic. They''ve been\
  \ prisoners for too long, and whatever happened to them won''t just fade. Medical says they''re\
  \ stable for now, but mentally? That''s another battle entirely. We should start preparing for\
  \ reintegration - or treatment.
prisoners.player.victory.good.14={0}, the rescue was successful, but it''s too soon to celebrate.\
  \ They''ve been through hell, and we don''t know what''s left of the soldiers we lost. We''ll get\
  \ them debriefed and assessed, but this isn''t over. Not for them, and not for us.
prisoners.player.victory.good.15=Well, {0}, it only took Allied Command <i>forever</i>, but they\
  \ finally pulled our people out. No details yet on how bad they''re messed up, but at least\
  \ they''re breathing. I''m sure the brass will pat themselves on the back for this one, like they\
  \ didn''t leave them rotting in a cell for weeks.
prisoners.player.victory.good.16=Guess what, {0}? Turns out Allied Command does know how to pull\
  \ off a rescue - just, you know, after dragging their feet long enough for our people to suffer.\
  \ They''re alive, but I wouldn''t call them ''okay.'' We''ll get a full report soon, assuming it isn''t\
  \ buried under classified nonsense.
prisoners.player.victory.good.17=Good news, {0} - our people are back. Bad news? We had to wait until\
  \ Allied Command finally got around to it. I''d love to say they''re in good shape, but I doubt it.\
  \ Let''s just hope they didn''t break anything - physically or mentally - too badly while they were\
  \ waiting on a rescue.
prisoners.player.victory.good.18=So, apparently, Allied Command decided today was the day they''d\
  \ remember our captured personnel exist. They pulled them out, no thanks to whatever bureaucratic\
  \ nightmare slowed things down. No idea what shape they''re in yet, but I''m sure the official\
  \ reports will be full of excuses.
prisoners.player.victory.good.19=They did it, {0}. Allied forces actually pulled off a rescue. Took\
  \ them long enough. Our people are back, but let''s not pretend this is some great victory - just\
  \ another reminder that when things go bad, we''re always at the bottom of the priority list. I''ll\
  \ have the MedTechs check on them and see what''s left.
prisoners.player.victory.good.20={0}, the rescue was successful. Our people are back, but they''ve\
  \ been through hell. Medical is looking them over now. No guarantees on who''s fit for duty, but\
  \ at least they''re alive. We''ll get them patched up and see who''s still got fight left in them.
prisoners.player.victory.good.21={0}, our personnel have been extracted. They''re breathing, but\
  \ that''s about all we know right now. No point sugarcoating it - captivity changes people. Some\
  \ will bounce back, some won''t. We''ll deal with it as it comes.
prisoners.player.victory.good.22={0}, the prisoners are back. No fatalities, but survival doesn''t\
  \ mean they''re intact. We''ll assess, adapt, and move forward. If they can fight, they fight. If\
  \ not, we figure out what''s next. Either way, we keep moving.
prisoners.player.victory.good.23=They''re back, {0}. Allied Command pulled them out, and now it''s\
  \ our turn to deal with the aftermath. No use worrying about what''s done. We check them, we get\
  \ them on their feet, and we keep going. That''s how this works.
prisoners.player.victory.good.24=Mission accomplished - our people are out. They''ll need time to\
  \ recover, but time''s a luxury we don''t always get. We''ll see who''s still got their edge and who\
  \ doesn''t. No room for dead weight in this outfit, but we owe them a chance to stand back up.
prisoners.player.victory.good.25={0}, guess who just made a dramatic comeback? Our missing folks.\
  \ Allied Command actually pulled it off, and they''re on their way back. No word yet on whether\
  \ they''re in fighting shape, but I figure after what they''ve been through, they''ve at least\
  \ earned the right to a strong drink.
prisoners.player.victory.good.26=Good news, {0} - our people are back, and despite everything,\
  \ they''re still in one piece. Physically, at least. Mentally? Well, we''ll see if captivity dulled\
  \ their sense of humor or just made it worse. Either way, we''re buying the first round when\
  \ they''re up and moving.
prisoners.player.victory.good.27=Well, look who decided to rejoin the living! Allied Command\
  \ finally yanked our folks out of whatever mess they were stuck in. They''re on the mend, and if I\
  \ know them, they''ll be cracking bad jokes about prison food before the day''s over.
prisoners.player.victory.good.28={0}, I don''t know what kind of favors you called in, but our\
  \ people are back. No fatalities, just a little worse for wear. I give it two days before they''re\
  \ trying to sneak out of medical and pretend nothing happened. We should probably chain them to the beds.
prisoners.player.victory.good.29=They made it, {0}! I''d love to say they walked out of captivity\
  \ looking heroic, but I hear most of them just collapsed into the nearest chair. Still,\
  \ they''re alive, and that''s what matters. We''ll give them time to recover - then we put them back\
  \ to work!
prisoners.player.victory.good.30={0}, Allied Command has secured our captured personnel. They are\
  \ currently undergoing medical evaluation. Their operational status remains undetermined.\
  \ Recommend prioritizing debriefing as soon as their condition allows us to assess potential\
  \ intelligence value.
prisoners.player.victory.good.31={0}, the extraction was successful. Our personnel have been\
  \ recovered with no additional casualties. Medical teams are handling immediate concerns. Once\
  \ cleared, we will need to evaluate their combat readiness and determine reintegration procedures.
prisoners.player.victory.good.32={0}, our missing personnel have been retrieved. No fatalities\
  \ reported. Their physical and psychological condition will dictate next steps. Expect a full\
  \ report within the next 24 hours, including a recommendation on their return to active duty.
prisoners.player.victory.good.33=Rescue operation confirmed successful. All personnel accounted\
  \ for. Medical is stabilizing them now. Tactical assessment required to determine if prolonged\
  \ captivity has compromised their effectiveness. Will advise once evaluations are complete.
prisoners.player.victory.good.34=Allied Command has completed retrieval of our personnel. Casualty\
  \ count remains at zero, but operational efficiency is in question. A full debrief and assessment\
  \ will follow. Until then, they are non-combat assets. Further instructions?
prisoners.player.victory.good.35={0}, they''re back. After everything, after all the waiting and not\
  \ knowing, our people are finally safe. Allied Command pulled them out, and they''re getting the\
  \ care they need. I won''t pretend they''re the same as when we lost them, but they made it home.\
  \ That''s what matters.
prisoners.player.victory.good.36={0}, we got them. Our people are alive. I can''t tell you what\
  \ they''ve been through, and honestly, I don''t think I want to know - not yet. What I do know is\
  \ that they fought to hold on, and now it''s our turn to help them find their way back.
prisoners.player.victory.good.37=They made it, {0}. Barely, maybe, but they made it. I keep\
  \ thinking about the times we talked about them like they were already gone, and now here they\
  \ are. They''re going to need us, and I won''t let them down. None of us will.
prisoners.player.victory.good.38=I won''t lie, {0} - I had my doubts. It felt like we were just\
  \ waiting for bad news, but against all odds, our people are back. They might be scarred, they\
  \ might be changed, but they''re here. And I swear, I won''t take that for granted.
prisoners.player.victory.good.39={0}, I just saw them. They''re alive, but they''ve been through more\
  \ than I can put into words. The fight didn''t end when they got captured - it just changed. Now,\
  \ it''s our turn to stand by them, to remind them that they still have a place here. We owe them\
  \ that much.
prisoners.player.victory.good.40={0}, Allied Command claims they ''rescued'' our people, but I''m not\
  \ celebrating yet. We don''t know what happened to them in captivity, what they were put through,\
  \ or what they might have said under pressure. Until we debrief them ourselves, I suggest we\
  \ treat this as an unknown variable, not a victory.
prisoners.player.victory.good.41={0}, they''re back - but something doesn''t sit right with me. Allied\
  \ Command took their sweet time getting them out, and now they''re acting like everything''s fine.\
  \ I want eyes on our people immediately. We don''t know what was done to them, what they might\
  \ have been forced into, or who they might answer to now.
prisoners.player.victory.good.42={0}, I don''t trust how this played out. Our people were prisoners\
  \ for too long, and now they''re suddenly ''safe''? The enemy doesn''t just give up prisoners without\
  \ a reason. We need to consider the possibility that this wasn''t just a rescue - it was a setup.
prisoners.player.victory.good.43=They made it out, {0}, but I have questions. Why now? Why them?\
  \ And why is Allied Command being so vague about the details? Until we know exactly what went\
  \ down, I suggest we keep them under close watch. For their sake - and ours.
prisoners.player.victory.good.44={0}, something''s off. I''ve seen men come back from captivity\
  \ before, and it''s never this clean. Either we''re missing something, or someone wants us to think\
  \ this is just another routine rescue. I say we don''t take anything at face value until we get\
  \ some real answers.
prisoners.player.victory.good.45={0}, our people are back, but the ones we lost in that prison\
  \ won''t be the same as the ones who returned. War doesn''t just take lives - it changes the ones who\
  \ survive. We got them out, but now comes the real battle: helping them find their way home, not\
  \ just physically, but mentally.
prisoners.player.victory.good.46={0}, survival is never simple. Our people are alive, but captivity\
  \ leaves marks you don''t always see. Some will talk about it, some won''t. Some will heal, some\
  \ never will. All we can do is be there when they need us - if they ever decide they do.
prisoners.player.victory.good.47={0}, they made it back, but at what cost? Time spent in the hands\
  \ of the enemy isn''t something you just walk away from. They lost something in there - maybe time,\
  \ maybe trust, maybe parts of themselves. It''s up to us to help them figure out what comes next.
prisoners.player.victory.good.48={0}, it''s easy to celebrate a rescue, to look at the numbers and\
  \ say ''we won.'' But this isn''t about numbers. It''s about the people who sat in a cell wondering\
  \ if we were coming, who faced things we''ll never fully understand. We saved them, but saving\
  isn''t the same as healing.
prisoners.player.victory.good.49={0}, war doesn''t just take - it lingers. It stays in the minds of\
  \ those who survive it, shaping them in ways they don''t always recognize. Our people are back,\
  \ but they''re carrying ghosts now. All we can do is make sure they don''t have to carry them alone.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.0={0}, prior to their withdrawal, enemy forces executed the captured\
  \ personnel. All attempts to negotiate or recover them were unsuccessful. Their remains have been\
  \ recovered where possible. Awaiting further orders on how to proceed.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.1={0}, intelligence confirms that our captured personnel were executed\
  \ by the enemy before their retreat. Recovery operations are underway, and a full report will\
  \ follow. No survivors.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.2={0}, we have confirmation that the enemy eliminated all captured\
  \ personnel before withdrawing from the area. We are securing the site now and will provide a\
  \ full accounting once the situation is stabilized.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.3={0}, it''s confirmed. The enemy executed our captured personnel\
  \ before pulling out. No one left behind. We are retrieving remains and will update you once\
  \ identification is complete.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.4={0}, the situation is as follows: all captured personnel were\
  \ executed before the enemy withdrew. We are gathering what intelligence we can from the site.\
  \ Orders regarding handling of the remains and notification of next of kin are requested.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.5={0}, it''s confirmed - our people didn''t make it. Before pulling out,\
  \ the enemy lined them up and executed them. We''ve recovered what we can, but this isn''t just a\
  \ loss, it''s a message. We need to be ready for what this does to the company.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.6={0}, we got there too late. The enemy didn''t leave any prisoners\
  \ behind, just bodies. No survivors. We''ll do what we can to recover them, but this is going to\
  \ hit the unit hard. We need to be prepared for the fallout.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.7={0}, the enemy made sure none of our captured personnel left their\
  \ custody alive. We''re retrieving the remains now, but this isn''t something our people will\
  \ forget. It''s a reminder of what we''re up against and what happens when we lose.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.8=It''s done, {0}. The enemy executed every last one of them before\
  \ pulling out. No mercy, no hesitation. We''ll collect who we can, but the damage is already done.\
  \ I don''t know how this is going to sit with the rest of the unit, but we need to keep an eye\
  \ on things.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.9={0}, they wiped them out before they ran. No ransom, no negotiations\
  \ - just cold-blooded execution. It''s brutal, but it''s what we should have expected from them. We\
  \ need to decide how we handle this, because the company is going to want blood.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.10=Well, {0}, looks like the enemy decided to handle the prisoner\
  \ situation their way - by lining them up and shooting them. No drawn-out negotiations, no prisoner\
  \ exchanges, just execution. But hey, at least we saved on the logistics of getting them back,\
  \ right?
prisoners.player.victory.bad.11={0}, in case you were wondering what our enemies think of\
  \ surrender, the answer is a bullet to the head. They didn''t even pretend to hold them for\
  \ ransom. I guess mercy wasn''t in the mission plan. Maybe next time someone suggests we ''trust\
  \ the process,'' we remind them how that worked out.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.12={0}, Allied Command dragged their feet, the enemy didn''t, and now\
  \ our people are dead. I''d love to say I''m surprised, but we both know how this game goes. We''ll\
  \ get the official condolences, the ''we did everything we could'' speech, and then move on like\
  \ this wasn''t completely avoidable.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.13=So, {0}, the enemy decided to expedite their prisoner transfer\
  \ process - straight to a mass grave. No red tape, no delays, just efficiency. Meanwhile, we were\
  \ busy waiting on permission to go after them. Maybe next time, we should stop pretending the\
  \ rules matter.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.14={0}, turns out all those reassurances about ''prisoners being\
  \ treated according to the rules of war'' were just empty words. The enemy made sure of that\
  \ before they retreated. Maybe someone up the chain will bother acknowledging what we''re actually\
  \ dealing with, but I won''t hold my breath.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.15={0}, it''s done. The enemy executed our captured personnel. No\
  \ survivors. We''ll recover what we can, notify the right people, and move forward. This war\
  \ doesn''t leave room for sentiment, only action.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.16={0}, they didn''t leave anyone behind. Our people are gone, executed\
  \ before the enemy retreated. We''ll collect the remains and keep moving. No point wasting time on\
  \ anger - we''ve got a war to finish.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.17={0}, we lost them. The enemy took the easy route and shot every\
  \ last one of our captured personnel before falling back. It''s ugly, but not unexpected. We deal\
  \ with it, we regroup, and we hit them harder next time.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.18=They''re gone, {0}. The enemy made sure of it before they left. This\
  \ is the reality of the job - we win, we lose, and sometimes we don''t get a chance to fix our\
  \ mistakes. We learn from it, and we don''t let it happen again.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.19={0}, our people are dead. The enemy executed them before\
  \ retreating, no hesitation, no second thoughts. We can mourn later, but right now, we focus on\
  \ what comes next. We still have a job to do.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.20={0}, the enemy executed all captured personnel before withdrawing.\
  \ This confirms their unwillingness to engage in prisoner exchanges or negotiations. Moving\
  \ forward, we should assume that any personnel taken will not be recovered alive and adjust our\
  \ operational planning accordingly.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.21={0}, the enemy eliminated all prisoners prior to their retreat.\
  \ This was a calculated move, likely to deny us any intelligence recovery or leverage. Recommend\
  \ we factor this into future engagements - surrender is no longer an option for our people.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.22={0}, no prisoners survived. The enemy made sure of that before\
  \ pulling out. This reinforces their doctrine - prisoners are a liability they won''t keep. We need\
  \ to ensure our teams understand the risks if captured. Expect morale impact, but operationally,\
  \ nothing changes.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.23=All personnel previously captured have been executed. The enemy''s\
  \ decision to eliminate them rather than use them for bargaining indicates a strategic choice,\
  \ likely to project strength or deter future surrenders. We should assess whether this affects\
  \ our own approach to enemy captives.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.24={0}, our prisoners are gone. The enemy left no one behind. This\
  \ simplifies the situation - there are no rescue operations to plan, no negotiations to consider.\
  \ We focus on what''s next: the next battle, the next target, and ensuring we don''t find ourselves\
  \ in the same position again.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.25={0}, they''re gone. The enemy didn''t give them a chance - they lined\
  \ them up and executed them before pulling out. These were our people, and now they''re nothing\
  \ but bodies left in the dirt. We owed them more than this.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.26={0}, it''s over. Our people didn''t make it. The enemy made sure of\
  \ that before they ran. I can''t stop thinking about what they must''ve felt in those last moments,\
  \ knowing we couldn''t get to them in time. We have to live with that now, but I swear, they won''t\
  \ be forgotten.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.27={0}, we failed them. I know it wasn''t by choice, I know it wasn''t\
  \ our call, but it doesn''t change the fact that they''re dead. We fought alongside them, laughed\
  \ with them, shared drinks and war stories. And now they''re gone, just like that. This one''s\
  \ going to hurt.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.28=They executed them, {0}. Just like that, as if they were nothing.\
  \ These were our people - good soldiers, good friends. We''ve all lost people before, but this one\
  \ feels different. Maybe it''s because we had hope, maybe it''s because they were so close to\
  \ coming home. Either way, this one cuts deep.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.29={0}, I don''t have the right words for this. They''re gone. The enemy\
  \ didn''t give them a second thought, but we will. They were more than just casualties, more than\
  \ names on a list. They mattered - to this company, to all of us. And I don''t think any of us will\
  \ ever forget this.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.30={0}, this wasn''t just an execution - it was a statement. The enemy\
  \ could have left them behind, ransomed them, used them as leverage. Instead, they wiped them out\
  \ completely. Why? What were they trying to tell us? This feels like more than just a retreat - it\
  \ feels like a warning.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.31={0}, something doesn''t add up. The enemy executed our people before\
  \ pulling out, but the way they did it - organized, deliberate - makes me wonder if there''s more to\
  \ this. Were they trying to send a message, or were they covering something up? We need to be\
  \ careful moving forward.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.32={0}, this wasn''t just a war crime - it was calculated. They didn''t\
  \ just kill our people, they made sure we found them like this. Why? Are they trying to provoke\
  \ us? Manipulate us? I don''t like it. We need to be damn sure we''re not walking into whatever\
  \ comes next blind.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.33={0}, I don''t trust this. The enemy had no reason to execute every\
  \ single prisoner unless they were trying to hide something. What did our people see? What did\
  \ they learn? We need to assume there''s more to this than just cruelty and look deeper before we\
  \ react.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.34={0}, I keep thinking - why now? Why execute them right before\
  \ retreating? This doesn''t feel like desperation, it feels like planning. Either they wanted to\
  \ bait us into something, or they''re setting the stage for something bigger. We need to be\
  \ careful how we respond.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.35={0}, they executed our people in cold blood. No mercy, no reason\
  \ - just slaughter. We can''t let this stand. They think they can wipe us out, that we''ll just\
  \ accept this and move on. They''re wrong. We will find them, and we will make them pay for every\
  \ life they stole.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.36={0}, they crossed a line. This wasn''t war, this wasn''t battle - this\
  \ was murder. They executed our people like they were nothing, and if we don''t answer that, if we\
  \ don''t make them regret it, then what the hell are we fighting for? Give the order. Let''s make\
  \ this right.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.37={0}, we''re past negotiations, past reason. The enemy made their\
  \ choice when they lined up our people and pulled the trigger. We''re going to hunt them down,\
  \ every last one of them. Not just because we want to - but because we owe it to the ones they\
  \ stole from us.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.38={0}, they didn''t just kill our people - they sent a message. Well,\
  \ let''s send one back. No more restraint. No more waiting on orders from people who don''t bleed\
  \ with us. They wanted to make this personal? Fine. We''ll make sure they never forget what\
  \ they''ve done.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.39={0}, I hope the enemy enjoyed their little execution while it\
  \ lasted, because their time is up. They wanted to show us what they''re capable of - now it''s our\
  \ turn. We''re not just fighting a war anymore. This is vengeance, and we''re not stopping until\
  \ the last of them is buried.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.40={0}, our people are gone. Not in battle, not in some last stand,\
  \ but lined up and executed like they were nothing. War doesn''t just take lives - it changes the\
  \ ones left behind. The question now isn''t just how we respond, but how we live with this. How\
  \ many more times can we endure losses like this before we stop being who we were?
prisoners.player.victory.bad.41={0}, they''re dead. Not because they lost a fight, but because\
  \ someone decided they didn''t deserve to live. War is brutal, but this? This is different. This\
  \ isn''t just about strategy or survival - it''s about what kind of people we choose to be in a\
  \ galaxy that lets this happen.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.42={0}, every time we lose people like this, I wonder how many more\
  \ names we''ll have to add to the list before we start asking if it''s worth it. We tell ourselves\
  \ we fight for a reason - for survival, for honor, for a future. But looking at this, at the bodies\
  \ left behind... what kind of future are we really fighting for?
prisoners.player.victory.bad.43={0}, executions like this aren''t just about war - they''re about\
  \ control. The enemy wanted to make sure we knew that they hold life and death in their hands.\
  \ And maybe that''s true. But if we start thinking the same way, if we start treating this as just\
  \ another inevitable part of the job, then we''ve already lost more than just those lives.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.44={0}, we always tell ourselves we''ll remember the ones we lose, but\
  \ war has a way of burying people in more than just dirt. How many names have we already stopped\
  \ saying? How many faces have already faded? The enemy thinks they erased our people, but they\
  \ only win if we let them disappear from memory. We can''t let that happen.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.45={0}, it''s over. The enemy executed our people before pulling out,\
  \ and there''s nothing we can do to change that. We were too late. Again. I wish I had something\
  \ else to say, but I don''t. We lost them, just like we''ve lost so many before. And we''ll lose\
  \ more before this is done.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.46={0}, they''re gone. Executed, just like that. We can talk about\
  \ revenge, about justice, but we both know how this ends - it doesn''t bring them back, and it\
  \ doesn''t stop the next time. We''ll bury them, we''ll mourn, and then we''ll do what we always do.\
  \ Keep going, because we don''t have any other choice.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.47={0}, I don''t even feel angry anymore. Just tired. We fought for\
  \ them, we tried to get them back, but in the end, none of it mattered. The enemy did what they\
  \ always do, and we''re left picking up the pieces. I wish I could say this was the last time, but\
  \ we both know better.
prisoners.player.victory.bad.48={0}, I got nothing left to say. Our people are dead, and we\
  \ couldn''t stop it. Couldn''t save them, couldn''t change the outcome. We''ll add their names to the\
  \ list, and then we''ll move on - because that''s what we do. What else can we do?
prisoners.player.victory.bad.49={0}, they executed them. I wish I could tell you I''m shocked, but\
  \ I''m not. This war grinds people up and spits them out, and today, it was our people. Tomorrow,\
  \ it''ll be someone else. And the day after that, probably us. Tell me, Boss... when does it end?
prisoners.player.defeat.good.0={0}, the enemy has contacted us with an offer to ransom our captured\
  \ personnel. They are demanding {1} C-Bills for their release. No additional conditions have been stated.\
  \ Awaiting your decision on how to proceed.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.1={0}, we''ve received a ransom demand for our captured personnel. The\
  \ enemy is requesting {1} C-Bills in exchange for their safe return. Their message indicates they are\
  \ not open to negotiation. Standing by for your orders.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.2={0}, the enemy has offered to release our prisoners for a payment of\
  \ {1} C-Bills. The terms are simple - payment in full, immediate transfer upon receipt. No further\
  \ stipulations have been mentioned. Requesting guidance on next steps.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.3={0}, a formal ransom demand has been issued for our captured\
  \ personnel. The requested amount is {1} C-Bills. No threats of harm have been made, but no assurances of\
  \ good treatment either. Intelligence is working to verify the legitimacy of the offer. Awaiting\
  \ your directive.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.4={0}, we have an offer from the enemy to secure the release of our\
  \ captured personnel. The ransom is set at {1} C-Bills. Their transmission is brief and lacks details on\
  \ the prisoners'' condition. Do we accept?
prisoners.player.defeat.good.5={0}, the enemy is offering to ransom our captured personnel for {1} C-Bills.\
  \ I don''t trust it. They''ve held them this long, so why now? Either they''re getting desperate, or\
  \ they think they can squeeze more out of us than just cash. We should proceed carefully - this\
  \ could be a setup.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.6={0}, we just received a ransom demand from the enemy - {1} C-Bills for our\
  \ people. Something feels off. No threats, no deadlines, just a price tag. Either they''re baiting\
  \ us into a trap, or they''ve already gotten what they wanted from our people. We need to verify\
  \ before committing to anything.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.7={0}, the enemy is requesting {1} C-Bills in exchange for the return of our\
  \ captured personnel. It''s too clean, too simple. We need to consider the possibility that this\
  \ is more than a transaction. Are they compromised? Is this a diversion? I recommend we tread\
  \ carefully.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.8={0}, we''ve got a ransom demand for our people - {1} C-Bills. No conditions, no\
  \ negotiation, just a price. That alone makes me suspicious. They''ve had time to interrogate\
  \ them, use them, maybe even break them. We should confirm their status before we agree to\
  \ anything.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.9={0}, the enemy is offering our people back for {1} C-Bills, but I have\
  \ doubts. Are they actually alive? Are they in any state to return? Are we just funding their\
  \ next offensive? We should treat this as more than just a business deal - there''s more at play\
  \ here than credits.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.10={0}, the enemy just put a price on our people - {1} C-Bills. After everything\
  \ they''ve done, after holding them for this long, now they want to play the part of businessmen?\
  \ This isn''t a negotiation, it''s a shakedown. They know we want them back, and they''re trying to\
  \ bleed us dry for it.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.11={0}, the bastards are demanding {1} C-Bills for our people. First, they\
  \ capture them, probably torture them, and now they want us to pay to fix their mess? Like hell.\
  \ This isn''t a ransom - it''s extortion. And the worst part? They know we''ll consider it.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.12={0}, we just got their ''offer.'' {1} C-Bills to buy back the people they\
  \ stole from us. Like they''re doing us a favor. Like they''re not the reason we''re in this\
  \ situation to begin with. Every part of this makes my blood boil, but the real question is - how\
  \ much are we willing to give them for it?
prisoners.player.defeat.good.13={0}, the enemy wants {1} C-Bills in exchange for our captured personnel.\
  \ Sure, because after taking them, locking them up, and gods know what else, now they suddenly\
  \ have a conscience? No. This is just another way for them to make us bleed, and they know it.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.14={0}, they''ve named their price - {1} C-Bills. It''s funny, really. First, they\
  \ took our people, and now they''re trying to sell them back like they''re some kind of product.\
  \ They don''t see soldiers, comrades, or people - they see profit. And that''s what disgusts me the\
  \ most.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.15={0}, the enemy is asking for {1} C-Bills to return our people. No tricks,\
  \ no conditions - just a price. We either pay and get them back, or we don''t and accept the loss.\
  \ It''s that simple. Your call.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.16={0}, they want {1} C-Bills for our captured personnel. We need to decide if\
  \ they''re worth that much to us, because the enemy sure as hell isn''t making this about anything\
  \ but cold, hard cash. No emotions - just numbers.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.17={0}, ransom is set at {1} C-Bills. We can negotiate, but at the end of the\
  \ day, we''re paying for bodies, not guarantees. If we want them back, we cough up the cash. If\
  \ not, we move on. Either way, we don''t waste time.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.18={0}, {1} C-Bills is the price on our people. No promises on their\
  \ condition, no leverage on our side. It''s a buy-in or walk-away situation. No point getting\
  \ sentimental - just tell me if we''re paying or not.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.19={0}, the enemy is treating this like a business deal, and so should\
  \ we. {1} C-Bills gets our people back, assuming they don''t double-cross us. If we pay, we need to make\
  \ sure we''re not just funding their next move. If we don''t, we live with the consequences. Make\
  \ the call.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.20={0}, the enemy is demanding {1} C-Bills for the return of our captured\
  \ personnel. We need to evaluate whether their recovery is worth the cost. If they are\
  \ compromised or unfit for duty, paying may not be in our best interest. Recommend a full risk\
  \ assessment before making a decision.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.21={0}, ransom has been set at {1} C-Bills. We need to determine if the\
  \ personnel in question are still assets or liabilities. If they''ve been interrogated or broken,\
  \ their value to us diminishes. Financial resources could be better allocated elsewhere if the\
  \ return doesn''t justify the expense.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.22={0}, the enemy has offered our people back for {1} C-Bills. This isn''t just\
  \ a question of funds - it''s a matter of operational efficiency. Paying means reinforcing their war\
  \ chest; refusing means writing off our losses. The choice comes down to what benefits us in the\
  \ long term.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.23={0}, we have a decision to make. The enemy wants {1} C-Bills for our\
  \ personnel. If we accept, we need contingencies in place for potential double-crosses or\
  \ compromised soldiers. If we decline, we must be prepared for the morale impact on the company.\
  \ Either way, this is a strategic calculation, not an emotional one.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.24={0}, ransom is set at {1} C-Bills. Logically speaking, we need to assess\
  \ the cost-benefit ratio. Paying might secure their release, but it also sets a precedent. If\
  \ they are no longer viable assets, retrieval may not be worth the price. We should weigh the\
  \ risks before committing resources.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.25={0}, the enemy has offered to ransom our people for {1} C-Bills. It''s a\
  \ chance to get them back, but we can''t afford to be na\uFFFDve. We don''t know their condition, and we\
  \ don''t know if this is a clean deal or a setup. I want confirmation before we make any promises.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.26={0}, we finally have a shot at bringing our people home. The enemy\
  \ is asking for {1} C-Bills, and while I want to believe this is straightforward, we both know better. We\
  \ need to tread carefully - verify their status, confirm the exchange, and make sure we''re not\
  \ walking into a trap.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.27={0}, we''ve got an opportunity. The enemy says they''ll return our\
  \ captured personnel for {1} C-Bills. It''s the first good news we''ve had in a while, but I don''t trust\
  \ them. We need to confirm they''re still alive, still intact, and that this isn''t some elaborate\
  \ ploy.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.28={0}, we might be able to get them back. The ransom is set at {1} C-Bills,\
  \ and on the surface, it looks like a straightforward deal. But nothing about this war has been\
  \ clean, and I don''t want us paying for corpses or a double-cross. Let''s approach this with\
  \ caution.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.29={0}, we have a chance to recover our people. The enemy is demanding\
  \ {1} C-Bills, and while I want to be optimistic, I can''t ignore the risks. We need to confirm they''re\
  \ actually getting released and that we''re not just filling their war chest for nothing.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.30={0}, the enemy is demanding {1} C-Bills for our people, but something\
  \ doesn''t feel right. They''ve held them for too long - why sell them back now? Either they got what\
  \ they wanted, or they''ve turned them against us. We need to consider the possibility that we''re\
  \ not getting the same people we lost.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.31={0}, ransom offer just came in - {1} C-Bills for our personnel. I don''t like\
  \ it. If they''re willing to let them go, it means they''ve either broken them or don''t see them as\
  \ a threat anymore. We need to be absolutely sure they''re not compromised before we agree to\
  \ anything.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.32={0}, the enemy wants {1} C-Bills for our people, but I don''t trust this\
  \ deal. They''ve had time to extract intel, turn them, or worse. If we bring them back, we have to\
  \ assume they could be carrying more than just war wounds. We need a full debrief and quarantine\
  \ plan in place.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.33={0}, they''re offering to return our captured personnel for {1} C-Bills. Too\
  \ convenient. What''s stopping them from feeding us misinformation through prisoners they''ve\
  \ manipulated? What''s stopping them from planting a tracker, or using this as leverage for\
  \ something bigger? We need to think long-term before we take this bait.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.34={0}, we have a ransom demand for {1} C-Bills, but I don''t trust a damn word\
  \ of it. If they''re letting them go, it''s because they''ve already used them. Maybe it''s a trap.\
  \ Maybe they''ve been turned. Either way, we don''t just take them back without precautions.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.35={0}, we have a chance to bring them home. The enemy wants {1} C-Bills, and\
  \ I don''t care what it takes - we need to get our people back. They''ve been through hell, and they\
  \ deserve to see familiar faces again. We''ll deal with the cost later. Right now, we bring them\
  \ home.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.36={0}, they''re offering to release our people for {1} C-Bills. I know it''s\
  \ steep, I know it''s a risk, but these are our people. We don''t leave them behind, not if we have\
  \ any say in it. Whatever it takes, we get them back. That''s the only thing that matters.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.37={0}, the ransom is set at {1} C-Bills, and I don''t care if it''s a trap, a\
  \ trick, or a scam - we have to try. These aren''t just numbers on a balance sheet, they''re our own.\
  \ I won''t be the one to look the rest of the company in the eye and tell them we left our people\
  \ to rot.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.38={0}, this isn''t a debate. The enemy wants {1} C-Bills, and I don''t care if\
  \ we have to scrape every last credit together - we''re getting them back. We''ve already lost too\
  \ many, and I refuse to add more names to that list if we can stop it.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.39={0}, they''re still alive, and we have a way to bring them home. The\
  \ cost is {1} C-Bills, but how do we even put a price on our own people? I don''t care if it''s\
  \ unreasonable, I don''t care if it weakens our position - we owe them this. They held on long\
  \ enough, now it''s our turn to do the same.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.40={0}, the enemy is demanding {1} C-Bills for our people. I wish I could say\
  \ I was surprised, but this is just how things go, isn''t it? Another deal, another choice between\
  \ bleeding cash or bleeding lives. We''ve lost so many already. I don''t know if we can afford\
  \ this, but I also don''t know if I can stomach leaving them behind.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.41={0}, the ransom is {1} C-Bills. We both know this won''t be the last time we\
  \ get an offer like this. It''s just another weight on the pile, another impossible decision we''ll\
  \ carry long after this war is over - if it ever ends. Tell me what you want to do, and I''ll make\
  \ it happen.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.42={0}, they want {1} C-Bills for our captured personnel. We can pay, or we\
  \ can let them go. Either way, we lose something. That''s just how it is now - no good choices, just\
  \ different kinds of regret. Let me know which one we''re taking this time.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.43={0}, the enemy put a price on our people: {1} C-Bills. I''m tired of having\
  \ to weigh lives against numbers, of pretending there''s a ''right'' answer here. If we pay, we\
  \ weaken ourselves. If we don''t, we let them die. Either way, it never stops. Just say the word,\
  \ and we''ll do what has to be done.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.44={0}, they''ve named their price - {1} C-Bills. I don''t even know what to say\
  \ anymore. Every time we think we''ve hit the bottom, war finds a way to dig the hole deeper.\
  \ We''ll pay if you say so. We''ll walk away if we have to. Either way, I doubt we''ll sleep any\
  \ better tonight.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.45={0}, the enemy is asking for {1} C-Bills to return our people. This is a\
  \ business deal, nothing more. We either pay and get them back, or we don''t and cut our losses.\
  \ No emotions - just numbers. Let me know how you want to proceed.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.46={0}, we have a ransom offer - {1} C-Bills. We need to decide if their return\
  \ is worth the cost, or if we''re better off using those resources elsewhere. Either way, we make\
  \ the call based on what benefits the company, not sentiment.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.47={0}, {1} C-Bills is the price they''ve put on our captured personnel. We\
  \ need to evaluate their operational value versus the financial impact. If they''re still an\
  \ asset, we recover them. If not, we move on. Simple as that.
prisoners.player.defeat.good.48={0}, we have a straightforward transaction in front of us - {1} C-Bills for\
  \ our people. If we pay, we reinforce their tactics. If we don''t, we take the hit. It''s a\
  \ cost-benefit scenario. What''s the call?
prisoners.player.defeat.good.49={0}, the enemy is offering our personnel back for {1} C-Bills. No strings\
  \ attached, just a number. We need to decide if they''re worth the investment, or if this is a\
  \ sunk cost we have to walk away from. Either way, I need an answer.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.0={0}, the enemy has executed all personnel taken captive during the\
  \ campaign. Their bodies were abandoned at their last known holding site. We have neither the\
  \ time nor the resources to recover them. Preparing final withdrawal procedures as ordered.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.1={0}, we''ve received confirmation that the enemy has carried out\
  \ executions on all captured personnel. No survivors. The remains have been left behind. This\
  \ does not alter our withdrawal timeline.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.2={0}, the enemy has eliminated all prisoners prior to our departure.\
  \ There were no offers of negotiation, no demands - just execution. We have no further personnel to\
  \ account for. Standing by for final extraction orders.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.3={0}, intelligence reports confirm the enemy executed all our captured\
  \ personnel before we could leave the system. The action appears to be retaliatory in nature. The\
  \ losses have been logged. Extraction preparations remain on schedule.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.4={0}, all previously captured personnel have been confirmed KIA. The\
  \ enemy executed them before their withdrawal. Recovery is not viable. No further action required\
  \ regarding their status. Standing by for departure.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.5={0}, it''s confirmed. The enemy executed all of our captured personnel\
  \ before we could get out. No negotiations, no last-minute deals - just cold-blooded retaliation. I\
  \ won''t pretend this doesn''t matter. The crew is going to feel this, hard. We need to be ready\
  \ for the fallout.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.6={0}, they killed them. Every last one. No offers, no demands - just\
  \ execution. This wasn''t about strategy; this was payback. The unit is going to take this loss\
  \ personally, and I don''t blame them. We need to keep them focused. Otherwise, we might not get\
  \ out of here in one piece ourselves.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.7={0}, the enemy made sure none of our people were left behind alive. I\
  \ don''t know if it was revenge, a warning, or just cruelty, but the outcome is the same. The\
  \ unit is angry, but that won''t change anything. We still have people to get home. Let''s not\
  \ give them any more bodies.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.8={0}, before pulling out, the enemy executed every single prisoner\
  \ they took from us. We both know this war has never been clean, but this? This is going to stay\
  \ with people. We need to get the unit off this rock before someone does something reckless.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.9={0}, our people are gone. Executed before we could do anything about\
  \ it. The enemy wanted to make a statement, and they did. Morale is going to take a hit, but\
  \ right now, our priority is getting clear. We owe it to the ones still breathing to make sure we\
  \ don''t share the same fate.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.10={0}, they did it. The enemy lined up every last one of our people\
  \ and executed them before we could leave. Not because they had to, not because it changed the\
  \ war - just because they could. They wanted to send a message. Well, message received. I won''t\
  \ forget this, and neither should you.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.11={0}, they didn''t just beat us - they wanted to make damn sure we felt\
  \ it. Every one of our captured personnel is dead. Executed, dumped, and left behind like trash.\
  \ This wasn''t strategy, it was spite. And the worst part? We can''t do a damn thing about it. Not\
  \ right now, anyway.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.12={0}, before pulling out, the enemy took the time to personally make\
  \ sure none of our captured people made it out alive. Just a final knife in the gut before we\
  \ drag ourselves off this rock. They wanted us humiliated, broken. If they think this is over,\
  \ they don''t know us very well.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.13={0}, I don''t know what pisses me off more - the fact that they\
  \ executed our people, or the fact that we can''t stop them. They knew we were beaten, they knew\
  \ we were leaving, and still, they had to twist the knife. I hope they enjoy their victory while\
  \ it lasts, because I swear, we will pay them back for this.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.14={0}, all of our captured personnel are gone. Executed, one by one,\
  \ just so the enemy could rub salt in the wound before we left. They wanted to make sure we felt\
  \ powerless. That we''d carry this with us. And we will. Because someday, somehow, we''re going to\
  \ make them regret this.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.15={0}, it''s done. The enemy executed all our captured personnel before\
  \ pulling out. We can''t change it, and we can''t bring them back. What we can do is make sure the\
  \ rest of us get off this rock alive. We move forward - because that''s all there is left to do.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.16={0}, they killed them. Every last one. No bargaining, no prisoners,\
  \ just execution. It''s ugly, but we''ve seen ugly before. Right now, our focus needs to be on\
  \ getting out of here and keeping the rest of the company in one piece. Save the grief for when\
  \ we''re clear.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.17={0}, we both know how this goes. The enemy made their point by\
  \ putting our people down before they left. We can rage about it, or we can make sure it doesn''t\
  \ happen to anyone else under our command. Right now, survival is the priority. The rest can wait.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.18={0}, we lost them. The enemy saw the chance to hurt us and took it.\
  \ It stings, but war''s never been clean. We take the hit, we pull back, and we live to fight\
  \ another day. No other options on the table.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.19={0}, the enemy executed our people. We can waste time talking about\
  \ how brutal it is, or we can focus on what''s next. We get the company out of here, we regroup,\
  \ and we rebuild. We can''t afford to get stuck on this, not if we want to make it out ourselves.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.20={0}, the enemy has executed all captured personnel prior to our\
  \ withdrawal. This was a calculated decision - likely intended to demoralize us or eliminate any\
  \ potential intelligence leaks. Regardless, it does not alter our immediate objectives.\
  \ Extraction remains the priority.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.21={0}, intelligence confirms the enemy executed all prisoners before\
  \ retreating. Strategically, this suggests they were unwilling to negotiate or risk future\
  \ engagements. Their objective was to ensure we had no assets to recover. We proceed with\
  \ withdrawal as planned.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.22={0}, all captured personnel have been eliminated by the enemy.\
  \ Whether this was an act of retaliation or operational efficiency is irrelevant - the result is\
  \ the same. We have no reason to divert resources. Focus remains on securing our remaining forces\
  \ and leaving the system.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.23={0}, the enemy''s decision to execute our captured personnel is not\
  \ unexpected. It ensures we cannot recover them and sends a message about their stance on\
  \ prisoner exchanges. This changes nothing for us - our priority remains survival and regrouping\
  \ for future operations.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.24={0}, the loss of our captured personnel has been confirmed. The\
  \ enemy chose elimination over leverage, which speaks to their tactical doctrine. While this\
  \ impacts morale, it has no direct effect on our ability to withdraw. We should focus on\
  \ minimizing further losses.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.25={0}, they''re gone. The enemy executed every last one of our people\
  \ before we could get them back. I don''t know if it was revenge, cruelty, or just a message, but\
  \ it doesn''t matter. We failed them. They held on, waiting for us to come, and we never did. I\
  \ don''t know how we move past this.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.26={0}, it''s over. The enemy made sure of that. Every captured member\
  \ of this company is dead. They didn''t even try to bargain or use them - just lined them up and\
  \ ended it. I keep thinking about the last time we saw them, about the fact that they probably\
  \ thought we were coming. We weren''t fast enough. We weren''t strong enough. And now they''re gone.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.27={0}, I don''t have the right words for this. They executed our people\
  \ before we could even think about saving them. People we fought beside, laughed with, lived\
  \ with. I keep asking myself if we could have done something differently. If there was a way to\
  \ stop this. But there''s nothing left now except the loss.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.28={0}, our people are dead. Executed, dumped, left behind as if they\
  \ were nothing. But they weren''t nothing. They were ours. I don''t care why the enemy did it - I\
  \ just know that we''re leaving this system without them, and that''s going to haunt me for a long\
  \ time.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.29={0}, I wish I had better news. I wish there was something I could\
  \ say to make this easier. But I don''t. The enemy killed them all. No rescue, no second chances.\
  \ I can already see it in the faces of the crew - this one is going to stay with us. We lost this\
  \ fight, but it feels like we lost a lot more than that.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.30={0}, the enemy executed all of our captured personnel before we\
  \ could leave. This wasn''t just about killing them - it was about making sure we knew they did it.\
  \ They wanted us to see it, to carry it with us. Maybe they think it''ll break us. Maybe they''re\
  \ right. Either way, we can''t ignore the message they''re sending.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.31={0}, they didn''t just kill our people - they made sure we found out\
  \ about it before we left. That wasn''t about tying up loose ends; that was a statement. They want\
  \ us leaving this system angry, humiliated, maybe reckless. We need to think long and hard about\
  \ why they wanted this to be the last thing we remember.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.32={0}, something about this doesn''t sit right. The enemy could''ve just\
  \ kept our people, used them, traded them - but they wiped them out instead. And they made sure we\
  \ knew about it. Are they trying to provoke us? Make us rush into something stupid? This feels\
  \ like more than just revenge.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.33={0}, we just got confirmation - our captured personnel have all been\
  \ executed. The enemy didn''t have to do that. They chose to. The question is why. Are they trying\
  \ to bait us into coming back? Are they trying to make a point? We need to assume this was more\
  \ than just spite.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.34={0}, the enemy executed every one of our captured people, and I\
  \ don''t think it was just revenge. There''s something calculated about this. Maybe they wanted to\
  \ demoralize us, maybe they wanted to make sure we didn''t leave with any intel. Either way, we\
  \ can''t take this at face value. We need to stay sharp - this isn''t over.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.35={0}, they executed our people. No hesitation, no offers, no demands\
  \ - just cold-blooded murder. They wanted to make sure we left this system knowing exactly what\
  \ they''re capable of. Fine. We''ll leave, but this isn''t over. One day, we''re coming back, and\
  \ when we do, they''ll pay for every last one of our people they butchered.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.36={0}, the enemy made their choice. They didn''t just beat us - they made\
  \ sure we suffered for it. They took our people and executed them like it was nothing. They think\
  \ this ends here, that we''ll just leave and lick our wounds. No. We remember. And one day, we\
  \ settle the score.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.37={0}, I hope the enemy enjoyed their little display of power, because\
  \ they just made a mistake they won''t live long enough to regret. They executed our people in\
  \ cold blood, and if they think that means we''ll just slink away and forget, they don''t know who\
  \ they''re dealing with. We will not let this stand.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.38={0}, they wanted to send a message. They wanted us to leave this\
  \ system broken, defeated, knowing we lost more than a battle. They wanted us to carry this\
  \ weight forever. And we will. But not in the way they think. This isn''t over. This is a blood\
  \ debt, and I intend to see it repaid in full.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.39={0}, our people are gone. Not because they lost in battle, but\
  \ because the enemy chose to execute them like animals. This wasn''t war - it was slaughter. They\
  \ wanted to make sure we knew they had the power to take everything from us. We''re leaving today,\
  \ but one day, we will return. And when we do, we burn them to the ground.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.40={0}, it''s over. The enemy executed all of our captured personnel\
  \ before we could even think about getting them back. No demands, no negotiations - just more names\
  \ to add to the list of people we couldn''t save. I don''t even know what to say anymore. We''ve\
  \ lost too much on this campaign. Let''s just get out of here before we lose anyone else.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.41={0}, they''re gone. Every last one. The enemy made sure of it before\
  \ we could leave. I wish I could say I''m surprised, but this is just how it goes, isn''t it? We\
  \ fight, we lose, and the people we leave behind pay the price. All that''s left now is to pack up\
  \ what''s left of this company and go.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.42={0}, the enemy made their point - none of our people made it out\
  \ alive. Maybe it was revenge, maybe it was just cruelty, but either way, it doesn''t change a\
  \ thing. They''re gone, and we''re still standing. If you can call this standing. We need to leave\
  \ before this war chews up what''s left of us.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.43={0}, another fight, another loss. The enemy wiped out every last one\
  \ of our captured personnel before we could even try to get them back. I wish I could say we''ll\
  \ make them pay for it, but we both know how this goes. We survive, we carry the weight, and we\
  \ keep moving forward - because that''s all we can do.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.44={0}, it''s done. Our people are gone, executed before we could do\
  \ anything to stop it. I''d like to say this one feels different, but honestly, it doesn''t. It''s\
  \ just another loss in a war that doesn''t care about anything but the next battle. Let''s get the\
  \ company out of here while we still can.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.45={0}, it''s over. The enemy executed all of our people before we could\
  \ get them back. We''ve lost battles before, but this... this isn''t just a loss, it''s a wound that\
  \ won''t heal. War doesn''t just take lives - it leaves scars on the ones who survive. The question\
  \ now isn''t just how we move on, but what this turns us into.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.46={0}, our people are gone. Executed, discarded, erased like they\
  \ never mattered. But they did matter - to us, to this company, to the lives they touched. I wonder\
  \ how many more names we''ll have to add to the list before we start questioning if it''s worth it.\
  \ If we''re worth it. This war doesn''t just take - it changes.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.47={0}, this is what war does. It grinds us down, piece by piece,\
  \ taking people, stripping away hope, leaving behind only what''s necessary to keep fighting. The\
  \ enemy made sure our captured people wouldn''t leave this system alive. And now we have to ask\
  \ ourselves - how much longer do we keep doing this before there''s nothing left of us?
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.48={0}, they killed them all. Not in battle, not in a fair fight, just\
  \ lined them up and ended them. And the worst part? We''ve seen this before. We''ll see it again.\
  \ And no matter how many times it happens, we tell ourselves we''ll remember, we''ll honor them - but\
  \ war moves on, and so do we. I just wonder what kind of people we''ll be when all of this is over.
prisoners.player.defeat.bad.49={0}, they executed them before we could leave. I keep thinking - did\
  \ they know we weren''t coming? Did they hold out hope until the end? Or did they know, like we do\
  \ now, that war doesn''t care about hope? We carry their memory with us, but we also carry the\
  \ weight of knowing we failed them. And we will carry it for a long time.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.0={0}, the enemy has reached out with a request to negotiate the\
  \ ransom of their captured personnel. They are offering {1} C-Bills for their release. No additional\
  \ conditions have been stated. Awaiting your decision on how to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.1={0}, we have received a formal communication from the enemy\
  \ regarding the ransom of their captured personnel. They are proposing a payment of {1} C-Bills in\
  \ exchange for their release. No indication of alternative terms. Standing by for your response.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.2={0}, the enemy is requesting negotiations for the return of their\
  \ captured personnel. They have set the ransom at {1} C-Bills. No further stipulations or demands have\
  \ been presented. Awaiting instructions on next steps.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.3={0}, we have received a transmission from the enemy offering {1} C-Bills for\
  \ the return of their captured personnel. The offer appears legitimate, and no signs of deception\
  \ have been detected. Requesting guidance on whether to engage or decline.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.4={0}, the enemy has made an official request to ransom their\
  \ personnel, setting the price at {1} C-Bills. No additional terms or restrictions have been specified.\
  \ Intelligence is verifying the authenticity of the offer. Standing by for your directive.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.5="{0}, the enemy has offered {1} C-Bills for the return of their captured\
  \ personnel. With their forces in full retreat, there is no operational risk in accepting. This\
  \ is purely a financial decision - take the payout or hold onto them for other leverage. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.6={0}, we have received a ransom offer of {1} C-Bills for the release of enemy\
  \ prisoners. Their withdrawal is total, and there is no further tactical advantage in keeping\
  \ them. The only factor here is whether we want the payout or to deny them their personnel on\
  \ principle. Standing by for your decision.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.7={0}, the enemy is offering {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel. With no\
  \ further engagements expected, keeping them serves no strategic purpose beyond making a\
  \ statement. If we accept, we secure additional resources. If we refuse, we send a message.\
  \ Either way, this doesn''t affect our immediate situation.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.8={0}, the enemy is in full retreat and has requested the return of\
  \ their personnel for {1} C-Bills. There is no further risk to us, and their recovery won''t change the\
  \ outcome of this campaign. The only consideration is whether this sum is worth letting them walk\
  \ away. Let me know how you want to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.9={0}, an official request has been made by the enemy for the ransom\
  \ of their captured personnel. They are offering {1} C-Bills. Given their complete withdrawal, the only\
  \ factors in this decision are financial and ethical. If we want the payout, we take the deal. If\
  \ not, we keep them and decide their fate ourselves.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.10={0}, the enemy wants their people back. They''re offering {1} C-Bills for\
  \ the lot. They''re beaten, they''re running, and they know they don''t have leverage. This is just\
  \ business - take the money or don''t. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.11={0}, we''ve got a ransom offer - {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel.\
  \ They''re in no position to bargain, but credits are credits. We don''t need prisoners weighing us\
  \ down, and if we can get paid for cutting them loose, there''s no reason not to consider it.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.12={0}, the enemy is willing to pay {1} C-Bills to get their people back.\
  \ They''re out of the fight, so there''s no reason to keep them unless we just want to make a\
  \ statement. If the money''s good enough, we take it and move on.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.13={0}, they want their people, and they''re offering {1} C-Bills to get them.\
  \ They lost, and they know it - this is just damage control on their part. If we want the payout,\
  \ we make the deal. If not, we decide what to do with them ourselves.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.14={0}, the enemy''s offering {1} C-Bills for their prisoners. No tricks, no\
  \ games - just a price tag on bodies they want back. We can take the money and cut them loose, or\
  \ we hold onto them out of spite. Either way, it doesn''t change the outcome of this fight.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.15={0}, the enemy is offering {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel. It''s a\
  \ simple deal on the surface, but I don''t trust it. They''re beaten, they''re running, so why are\
  \ they so eager to get these people back? We need to consider if there''s more to this than just a\
  \ ransom payment.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.16={0}, we''ve received a ransom request - {1} C-Bills in exchange for their\
  \ prisoners. I can''t shake the feeling that this isn''t just about getting their people back. Are\
  \ these prisoners more valuable than we realize? Do they know something we don''t? We should think\
  \ carefully before deciding.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.17={0}, the enemy is offering {1} C-Bills for their personnel. It''s a clean\
  \ offer, but something about it feels off. They''ve lost, they''re running, yet they still care\
  \ enough to pay? Either they need these people badly, or they''re covering something up. I\
  \ recommend we dig deeper before we take the deal.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.18={0}, the enemy wants their people back and they''re willing to pay\
  \ {1} C-Bills for them. That alone makes me suspicious. Maybe they''re just desperate, maybe there''s more\
  \ to it. Are these high-value assets? Intelligence officers? If we let them go, are we handing\
  \ them a future advantage?
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.19={0}, they''ve named their price - {1} C-Bills - for the return of their captured\
  \ personnel. The timing is convenient, too convenient. They''re in full retreat, they''ve lost, and\
  \ yet they still want to make deals? I don''t like it. If we agree, we do it on our terms and keep\
  \ our eyes open.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.20={0}, the enemy is crawling back, offering {1} C-Bills to buy back their\
  \ people. Now that they''ve lost, they suddenly remember how negotiations work. Where was this\
  \ attitude when they were winning? Seems like they only care about their people when they''re the\
  \ ones bleeding.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.21={0}, we just got a ransom request - {1} C-Bills for their prisoners. Funny\
  \ how they had no interest in diplomacy until we had the upper hand. They want to save face,\
  \ patch up their pride, pretend they still have control. We both know they don''t.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.22={0}, the enemy''s offering {1} C-Bills to get their people back. After\
  \ everything, after all the blood and losses, now they want to talk deals? They weren''t\
  \ interested in mercy when they had the upper hand, but now that they''re running, they expect it\
  \ from us. Typical.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.23={0}, they want their people back and are offering {1} C-Bills for the\
  \ privilege. Amazing how fast their principles change when they''re the ones in the dirt. We can\
  \ take the money, or we can remind them that choices have consequences. Either way, they don''t\
  \ get to walk away clean.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.24={0}, the enemy thinks they can pay their way out of humiliation - {1} C-Bills\
  \ for the people we took off the field. After all their posturing, all their arrogance, this is\
  \ what it comes to? A buyout? They deserve to crawl for it, but that choice is yours.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.25={0}, the enemy is offering {1} C-Bills to buy back their people. After\
  \ everything they''ve done, after every life they''ve taken, they think they can just throw money\
  \ at us and walk away? No. They lost, and now they face the consequences. Mercy was their choice\
  \ to make, and they never gave us any.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.26={0}, they''re retreating, broken, beaten, and now they come begging\
  \ to buy back their own. {1} C-Bills for their prisoners. They didn''t hesitate to slaughter ours when\
  \ they had the upper hand, but now they want to talk deals? I say we give them the same treatment\
  \ they gave us - none.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.27={0}, they dare ask for their people back? After the lives they''ve\
  \ taken, the destruction they''ve caused? They''re offering {1} C-Bills like that makes it even. It\
  \ doesn''t. They want their people? They can come and take them - if they''ve got anything left to\
  \ fight with.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.28={0}, the enemy wants their soldiers back and is willing to pay {1} C-Bills\
  \ for them. As if credits can erase what they''ve done. As if money can make up for the blood\
  \ they''ve spilled. We should remind them that some debts can''t be bought off, only repaid in kind.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.29={0}, they think they can buy their way out of justice. {1} C-Bills for the\
  \ ones we took off the battlefield. Did they offer us the same when they had the chance? No. They\
  \ took, they destroyed, they killed. I say we let them rot in the mess they made.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.30={0}, the enemy has offered {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel, but\
  \ something about this feels wrong. They''re in full retreat - why do they care so much about\
  \ getting these people back? Either they know something we don''t, or this isn''t just about a\
  \ ransom. We should tread carefully.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.31={0}, we''ve received a ransom offer - {1} C-Bills for their people. Too\
  \ convenient. They lose the fight, run for the hills, and now they want to negotiate? What''s\
  \ stopping them from using this as a smokescreen for something bigger? We should assume there''s\
  \ more to this than credits.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.32={0}, the enemy wants their personnel back and is offering {1} C-Bills to\
  \ make it happen. I don''t like it. Are these prisoners worth more than we realize? Are we handing\
  \ them back strategists, spies, or saboteurs? We need to be sure we''re not playing into their\
  \ hands before we make a deal.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.33={0}, they''re offering {1} C-Bills for their people, and I have to ask -\
  \ what''s the catch? They lost, they''re beaten, but suddenly they want to cut a deal? Either they\
  \ need these prisoners for something bigger, or they''re using this as a distraction. We should be\
  \ very careful before agreeing to anything.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.34={0}, we just got a ransom request - {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel.\
  \ I don''t trust it. They''re retreating, but that doesn''t mean they''re done with us. What if this\
  \ is bait? A way to get eyes inside our operation? We need to assume there''s more to this than\
  \ just a payout.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.35={0}, the enemy is asking for their people back. They''re offering\
  \ {1} C-Bills, but this isn''t just about money. These are soldiers, just like ours, who followed orders,\
  \ fought, and lost. Do we show them the mercy they might not have given us? Or do we make an\
  \ example of them? Whatever choice we make, the company will remember it.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.36={0}, we''ve received a ransom offer - {1} C-Bills for their prisoners. We''ve\
  \ all lost people in this war, people we couldn''t get back no matter how much we would''ve paid.\
  \ Now the enemy is coming to us, hoping we''ll give them a chance we never got. What kind of\
  \ unit do we want to be?
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.37={0}, they want their people back, and they''re willing to pay {1} C-Bills.\
  \ After everything we''ve been through, after everything we''ve lost, it''s hard not to wonder - if\
  \ the roles were reversed, would they give us the same chance? Do we take the deal and walk away,\
  \ or do we make them feel the same loss we''ve endured?
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.38={0}, the enemy has made their offer - {1} C-Bills to get their people back.\
  \ There''s no strategy left here, no grand maneuver, just a simple question: Do we let them go?\
  \ We''ve fought, we''ve bled, we''ve lost friends along the way. Whatever we decide, it''s going to\
  \ say something about who we are as a company.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.39={0}, the war here is over, but now we have a decision to make. The\
  \ enemy wants their people back, offering {1} C-Bills for them. We have every right to refuse, to make\
  \ them suffer the way we have. But we also have the power to end this with dignity. No\
  \ battlefield, no guns - just a choice. What''s it going to be?
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.40={0}, the enemy wants their people back. They''re offering {1} C-Bills, and\
  \ honestly, I don''t even know if it matters anymore. We won, they lost, and now we''re just left\
  \ with the cleanup. We can take the money, let them go, or leave them to rot - but in the end, does\
  \ any of it really change what we''ve been through?
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.41={0}, we''ve got a ransom offer - {1} C-Bills for their prisoners. After\
  \ everything we''ve lost, everything we''ve been through, this just feels... hollow. We can take\
  \ their money, we can refuse, but either way, this war keeps moving, and we''ll be right back in\
  \ the thick of it somewhere else.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.42={0}, the enemy is in full retreat and still trying to claw back\
  \ what they can. They''re offering {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel. I can''t even bring myself to\
  \ care if we take the deal or not. We''ve seen too much, lost too much. If this is what passes for\
  \ victory, I don''t know what we''re still fighting for.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.43={0}, they want their people back. Offering {1} C-Bills like it means\
  \ something. Like any of this means anything anymore. We take the money, or we don''t. We let them\
  \ go, or we don''t. The war doesn''t stop. The losses don''t stop. Just tell me what you want to do,\
  \ and we''ll get it over with.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.44={0}, the enemy is asking for their people back, willing to pay {1} C-Bills.\
  \ I wish I could say I cared, that this felt like some kind of final victory, but it doesn''t.\
  \ We''re all just trying to survive, them included. Maybe that''s worth considering. Or maybe it\
  \ doesn''t matter at all.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.45={0}, the enemy is offering {1} C-Bills for their captured personnel. The\
  \ fighting is over, but now we decide what kind of victory this is. Do we take the money and let\
  \ them go? Do we refuse and make a statement? War isn''t just about who has the bigger guns - it''s\
  \ about the choices we make when the guns go quiet.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.46={0}, they want their people back. {1} C-Bills in exchange. It''s not about\
  \ strategy anymore - it''s about what kind of unit we are. Do we show mercy to a beaten enemy, or do\
  \ we remind them that actions have consequences? Either way, the crew will remember what we\
  \ decide today.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.47={0}, the war here is over, but we still have a choice to make. The\
  \ enemy is offering {1} C-Bills for their personnel. Is it worth holding on to them just to prove a\
  \ point? Or do we take the deal and move forward? Winning a battle is one thing. Deciding what\
  \ comes next is another.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.48={0}, they''ve come to us, {1} C-Bills in hand, hoping to buy back their\
  \ people. It''s a strange thing, the weight of power after a fight is done. We could release them\
  \ and be done with it, or we could refuse and make them live with their defeat a little longer.\
  \ Either way, this decision will shape how people see us, and maybe how we see ourselves.
prisoners.enemy.victory.good.49={0}, they''re offering {1} C-Bills to get their people back. Maybe we take\
  \ the money, maybe we don''t. Maybe we hold onto them, maybe we let them walk. But I keep thinking\
  \ - when does the war actually end? Is it when the fighting stops, or when we stop treating our\
  \ enemies like enemies? I don''t have an answer. Maybe you do.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.0={0}, the enemy has abandoned the prisoners currently in our custody.\
  \ Allied Command has offered to take them off our hands but has made it clear they will provide\
  \ no compensation. There are no additional conditions attached to the transfer. Awaiting your\
  \ decision on how to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.1={0}, with the enemy''s retreat, the prisoners in our custody have been\
  \ officially abandoned. Allied Command has expressed interest in taking them but is unwilling to\
  \ offer any form of payment or resources in return. No immediate obligation on our end. Standing\
  \ by for orders.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.2={0}, the situation with the enemy prisoners has changed. Their forces\
  \ have left them behind, and Allied Command is willing to take them into custody. However, they\
  \ have stated that they will not be offering any form of compensation. Let me know how you want\
  \ to handle this.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.3={0}, Allied Command has reached out regarding the prisoners. Since\
  \ their forces have fully retreated, the captives are now our responsibility. Allied Command is\
  \ offering to take them, but they have confirmed they will not be providing any payment or other\
  \ compensation. Standing by for your response.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.4={0}, the enemy has abandoned their captured personnel, and Allied\
  \ Command has offered to assume custody. However, they are unwilling to compensate us for the\
  \ transfer. There are no stipulations beyond the handover itself. I need your decision on whether\
  \ we proceed with the handoff or pursue alternative options.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.5={0}, the enemy has abandoned their captured personnel, leaving us\
  \ with a logistical issue. Allied Command is willing to take them off our hands but has stated\
  \ there will be no compensation. From a resource standpoint, keeping them serves no tactical\
  \ purpose. If we hand them over, we clear an operational burden without gaining anything in\
  \ return. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.6={0}, with the enemy in full retreat, the prisoners they left behind\
  \ are now our problem. Allied Command has offered to take custody but is refusing to provide any\
  \ payment or resources. Keeping them requires security and supplies we could use elsewhere. We\
  \ need to determine if it''s worth holding on to them or if cutting our losses is the better\
  \ option.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.7={0}, we''re holding a number of abandoned prisoners, and Allied\
  \ Command has made it clear they will take them but won''t pay for the privilege. Functionally,\
  \ this decision is about efficiency - do we waste resources maintaining custody, or do we hand them\
  \ over for free and move on? Either way, we gain nothing, but at least one option removes a\
  \ logistical concern.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.8={0}, we have prisoners left behind by the enemy, and Allied Command\
  \ is willing to take them with no strings attached - except that they won''t compensate us. The only\
  \ benefit to transferring them is eliminating the cost of keeping them. If we refuse, we should\
  \ have a plan for what to do with them long-term. Let me know how you want to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.9={0}, Allied Command has reached out regarding the enemy prisoners.\
  \ They''re offering to take them off our hands, but they''re refusing to pay. Strategically,\
  \ keeping them does nothing for us, but neither does giving them away for free. If there''s no\
  \ advantage in either direction, we should go with the option that costs us the least time and\
  \ effort.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.10={0}, the enemy ran and left their people behind. Now Allied Command\
  \ wants to take them off our hands - for free. No payment, no favors, just us doing them a\
  \ courtesy. It''s not fair, but war rarely is. We either dump them on Allied Command and move on,\
  \ or we figure out what else to do with them. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.11={0}, we''ve got a pile of abandoned prisoners, and Allied Command\
  \ wants them - but they''re not offering a single damn thing in return. Doesn''t seem like much of a\
  \ deal, but keeping them means wasting food, time, and manpower on a problem that isn''t ours\
  \ anymore. Let me know if we''re cutting them loose or holding onto them for some reason.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.12={0}, the enemy didn''t care enough to take their own people with\
  \ them, and now Allied Command expects us to hand them over for nothing. It''s a raw deal, but\
  \ hauling prisoners isn''t exactly our business either. We can take the hit and move on, or we can\
  \ keep them and figure out if they''re worth anything to us.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.13={0}, Allied Command says they''ll take the prisoners off our hands,\
  \ but they''re not paying. Typical. We could try to get something out of them, but I doubt they''ll\
  \ budge. The alternative is keeping a bunch of enemy soldiers locked up, draining our resources\
  \ for no real gain. Your call, but I say we let them be someone else''s problem.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.14={0}, we''re stuck with enemy prisoners, and Allied Command is happy\
  \ to take them - just not happy enough to actually compensate us. No surprise there. Holding onto\
  \ them doesn''t get us anything but a headache, so unless you''ve got another use for them, I say\
  \ we hand them over and focus on what actually matters.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.15={0}, Allied Command is offering to take the enemy prisoners off our\
  \ hands, but they''re refusing to compensate us. That doesn''t sit right with me. They''re in a\
  \ hurry to collect, but they don''t want to pay? Either these prisoners are worth more than we\
  \ realize, or Allied Command knows something we don''t. I suggest we figure out why before we\
  \ agree to anything.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.16={0}, we''ve got an offer from Allied Command - they''ll take the\
  \ prisoners, but they won''t pay. That''s convenient for them, but I have to ask - why the rush? Are\
  \ these prisoners valuable in ways we haven''t considered? Are we handing over someone important\
  \ without realizing it? I don''t like loose ends, and this feels like one.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.17={0}, the enemy abandoned their people, and now Allied Command is all\
  \ too eager to step in and scoop them up - for free. That''s what bothers me. If they had no value,\
  \ Command wouldn''t care. So what''s the play here? Are they sitting on intel? Are they bargaining\
  \ chips? If we just hand them over, we might never know.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.18={0}, Allied Command wants the prisoners, no questions asked, no\
  \ payment offered. That''s what makes me suspicious. If they weren''t worth anything, they''d leave\
  \ them for us to deal with. If they are worth something, why aren''t we getting a cut? We should\
  \ think carefully before we let them go.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.19={0}, something about this doesn''t feel right. Allied Command is\
  \ happy to take these prisoners off our hands, but they won''t give us so much as a token payment.\
  \ Why? Either these prisoners are worthless, or they''re worth a lot - and Command doesn''t want us\
  \ to know which. I''d recommend pressing for more details before making a decision.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.20={0}, Allied Command wants us to hand over the enemy prisoners, but -\
  \ surprise, surprise - they''re not offering a single damn thing in return. Typical. They''re happy\
  \ to use us when there''s a fight to win, but the second the dust settles, we''re back to being\
  \ disposable. If they want these prisoners so badly, they can start by making it worth our while.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.21={0}, we''ve been told to turn over the prisoners to Allied Command,\
  \ no compensation, no gratitude, just another ''do as you''re told'' order. They don''t even have the\
  \ courtesy to pretend we''re equals. I guess mercenary blood is good enough to win their wars, but\
  \ not good enough to get paid when it''s over.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.22={0}, the enemy left their people behind, and now Allied Command\
  \ wants us to clean up the mess - for free. Of course they do. They get the benefit, we get\
  \ nothing, and we''re just supposed to nod along like good little soldiers. If they''re not paying,\
  \ then maybe we should decide for ourselves what happens to these prisoners.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.23={0}, Allied Command''s come knocking. They want the prisoners, but\
  \ they won''t pay, because why would they? They know we don''t have the political sway to argue, so\
  \ they expect us to just hand them over. We do the dirty work, and they reap the rewards. I''m\
  \ getting real tired of this arrangement.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.24={0}, it''s the same story every time. We fight, we bleed, we win, and\
  \ when it''s all over, Allied Command comes in and takes what they want without giving us so much\
  \ as a thank you. They expect us to hand these prisoners over for nothing? Maybe it''s time we\
  \ start setting our own terms instead of playing by theirs.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.25={0}, the enemy left their people behind to rot, and now Allied\
  \ Command expects us to clean up their mess - for free. That''s an insult, plain and simple. We\
  \ fought for this victory, we bled for it, and now they want to swoop in and take what''s left\
  \ without offering anything in return? No. If they want these prisoners, they''d better show some\
  \ respect and pay what''s owed.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.26={0}, this isn''t just about money. The enemy abandoned their own,\
  \ left them to die, and now Allied Command wants to pretend they''re taking the high road by\
  \ offering them a way out? No. If we hand them over for nothing, we''re telling every bastard in\
  \ this war that leaving their own behind is acceptable. It''s not. We should decide their fate,\
  \ not Command.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.27={0}, I refuse to let Allied Command act like we''re some charity\
  \ operation. We put in the work, we took the risks, and now they''re trying to walk away with the\
  \ prize for nothing? It''s disgraceful. They wouldn''t dare ask this of one of their own units, but\
  \ because we''re mercenaries, they think they can walk all over us. I say we remind them otherwise.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.28={0}, we''ve got enemy prisoners that were abandoned, tossed aside\
  \ like garbage by their own people. That tells me everything I need to know about who we were\
  \ fighting. But Allied Command? They want to pretend this is just another transaction they don''t\
  \ have to honor. They want the moral high ground without paying for it. That''s not how this works.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.29={0}, what kind of message does this send? That a commander can throw\
  \ away their own soldiers and someone else will clean it up for them? That our time, our effort,\
  \ our sacrifices don''t matter? If Allied Command wants these prisoners, they''d better start \
  treating us like professionals and not some disposable clean-up crew.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.30={0}, Allied Command wants the prisoners, but they won''t pay. That''s\
  \ what bothers me. They could leave them to rot or let us handle it, but they''re insisting on\
  \ taking custody. Why? These aren''t just abandoned soldiers to them - there''s something else going\
  \ on. I don''t like handing over assets without knowing what game we''re playing.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.31={0}, something about this stinks. Allied Command is refusing to\
  \ compensate us, yet they''re eager to collect the prisoners we captured. Makes me wonder - do they\
  \ know something we don''t? Are these prisoners more valuable than we realize? They wouldn''t be\
  \ this quick to claim them if they weren''t worth something. Maybe we should find out what that is\
  \ before we sign them away.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.32={0}, I don''t trust this. The enemy abandoned their people, and now\
  \ Allied Command is sweeping in like vultures, acting like they''re doing us a favor by taking\
  \ them off our hands. Why the rush? Are these prisoners carrying intel? Are they someone\
  \ important? I don''t like giving things away for free - especially when I don''t know what''s really\
  \ at stake.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.33={0}, Allied Command is making this look like a simple cleanup\
  \ operation, but I''m not buying it. If these prisoners were worthless, they''d leave them with us\
  \ to deal with. But they''re not - they want them, and they''re making sure we don''t get anything in\
  \ return. What are we missing here? They might be getting more out of this than they''re letting\
  \ on.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.34={0}, I''ve seen this play before. They''re calling this routine, but\
  \ it''s anything but. Allied Command doesn''t take prisoners unless they see an opportunity -\
  \ intelligence, political leverage, maybe even a backroom deal we aren''t in on. They won''t say it\
  \ outright, but these captives are worth something to someone. The question is, do we let them\
  \ take the prize while we walk away with nothing?
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.35={0}, the enemy abandoned their own people. Just left them behind\
  \ like they meant nothing. And now Allied Command wants to take them off our hands - for free. I\
  \ get that we''re mercenaries, that we work for pay, but this isn''t just about money. What we\
  \ decide here says something about who we are. Do we turn them over? Do we leave them to fend for\
  \ themselves? Whatever we do, our people will remember it.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.36={0}, these prisoners aren''t soldiers to their commanders anymore -\
  \ they''re baggage. Their own people cut them loose, and now Allied Command wants to sweep them up\
  \ like nothing happened. No offer, no compensation, just an expectation. We need to think about\
  \ what handing them over for nothing means, not just for us, but for them. If we do this, we\
  \ should at least do it on our terms.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.37={0}, I know we don''t owe these prisoners anything, but I keep\
  \ thinking - what if it were us? What if we got left behind, discarded, and treated like we\
  \ didn''t matter? The people we hold right now are soldiers who fought for the wrong side, sure,\
  \ but they''re still people. Maybe that doesn''t mean much in this line of work, but maybe it\
  \ should.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.38={0}, we built this unit on more than just money. Reputation,\
  \ honor, the way we handle ourselves when no one''s watching - that matters. The enemy may have\
  \ thrown these prisoners away, but that doesn''t mean we have to. Allied Command won''t pay us,\
  \ fine. But before we hand them over, we need to ask ourselves: are we doing this because it''s\
  \ the right thing, or just because it''s convenient?
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.39={0}, this war chews people up and spits them out, and right now,\
  \ we''re standing over what''s left of the enemy''s castoffs. Allied Command sees prisoners as\
  \ assets, but to us, they''re a problem to deal with. No one''s paying us, no one''s forcing us, so\
  \ what happens to them is entirely up to us. And that means, for once, we get to decide what the\
  \ right thing really is.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.40={0}, Allied Command wants the prisoners. They''re not offering\
  \ compensation, not even a token show of gratitude. Just another job they expect us to do for\
  \ free. We fight, we bleed, and when it''s over, they act like we don''t matter anymore. It''s\
  \ always the same story. We just have to decide if we''re playing along this time.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.41={0}, the enemy threw away their own people, and now Allied Command\
  \ expects us to hand them over like it''s our responsibility. No pay, no thanks, just an order\
  \ disguised as an offer. We''re useful when the fight''s still going, but the second it''s over,\
  \ we''re just another loose end to clean up. I''m tired of it.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.42={0}, we won the fight, and somehow, we still come out with nothing.\
  \ The enemy abandoned their prisoners, and now Allied Command wants us to hand them over for\
  \ free. No compensation, no recognition - just another reminder that mercenaries do the dirty work\
  \ and never see the rewards. Makes you wonder why we bother.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.43={0}, we''ve got prisoners, and Allied Command wants them. Won''t pay,\
  \ won''t bargain, just expects us to comply like we''re some charity outfit. We always get stuck\
  \ with the hard choices, and we never see a damn thing for it. At this point, I don''t know what''s\
  \ worse - getting used or knowing we''ll let it happen again.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.44={0}, the war here is over, and once again, we''re left with the\
  \ scraps while the big players move on. Allied Command is taking the prisoners off our hands, but\
  \ they won''t pay. They never do. We do the work, we take the risks, and in the end, we''re just\
  \ expected to walk away like it was nothing. I don''t know about you, but I''m getting real tired\
  \ of being disposable.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.45={0}, the enemy left their own behind, and now Allied Command wants\
  \ to take them off our hands - no payment, no thanks, just an expectation. It makes me wonder, when\
  \ the war turns against us, who would come for us? Would we be abandoned just as easily? Maybe\
  \ that''s the nature of war, or maybe it''s just the way people choose to play it.
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.46={0}, we hold the fates of these prisoners in our hands, but does it\
  \ really matter? Allied Command wants them, and they''ll take them without a second thought,\
  \ without offering anything in return. Are we just another cog in the machine, expected to do\
  \ what''s efficient? Or do we make our own choices about what''s right and wrong, even when there''s\
  \ no profit in it?
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.47={0}, this war is over, at least for now, but there''s always another\
  \ one coming. And every time, people get left behind - forgotten, discarded, abandoned like these\
  \ prisoners. Maybe it''s not about what we gain or lose here, but about what kind of unit we want\
  \ to be. Do we set the example, or do we just go along with the way things have always been?
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.48={0}, we''ve spent our whole careers fighting for pay, taking\
  \ contracts, moving from one battlefield to the next. And yet, here we are, holding the lives of\
  \ men and women who no longer matter to their own leaders. Maybe we hand them over. Maybe we\
  \ don''t. But what we decide here isn''t just about them - it''s about us. How do we want to be\
  \ remembered?
prisoners.enemy.victory.bad.49={0}, the enemy cut their people loose, and Allied Command is ready\
  \ to sweep them up without giving us so much as a second look. It''s easy to see this as just\
  \ another deal, another exchange. But I wonder - when this war is long over, when no one remembers\
  \ the battles, what will they remember about us? That we took what we could and walked away? Or\
  \ that we made decisions based on more than just profit?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.0={0}, Allied Command has contacted us regarding the enemy personnel in\
  \ our custody. They are offering {1} C-Bills in exchange for their transfer. No details have been\
  \ provided on their intended use for the prisoners, but possibilities include intelligence\
  \ debriefs, war crimes trials, or forced labor. Awaiting your decision on how to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.1={0}, we have received a formal request from Allied Command to take\
  \ custody of all prisoners we acquired during the campaign. They are prepared to compensate us\
  \ with {1} C-Bills. Their plans for the captives are unknown, but they may be seeking leverage for\
  \ political negotiations, prisoner exchanges, or strategic interrogations. Standing by for your\
  \ instructions.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.2={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for custody of all enemy\
  \ personnel currently held by our forces. No additional terms or conditions were provided, nor\
  \ any explanation of their intent. Possible outcomes include battlefield executions, indefinite\
  \ detention, or recruitment into their own forces. We will process the transfer upon your\
  \ authorization.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.3={0}, an official request has been made by Allied Command to assume\
  \ responsibility for the prisoners in our custody. The compensation amount stands at {1} C-Bills. They\
  \ have not specified their intentions, but they could be seeking to eliminate remaining enemy\
  \ leadership, use them for intelligence extraction, or exploit them as bargaining chips. Your\
  \ call.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.4={0}, Allied Command has extended an offer of {1} C-Bills for the immediate\
  \ transfer of our captured personnel. Their end goal is unclear - could be rehabilitation, could be\
  \ black-site interrogations, could be something worse. Either way, once we hand them over, it''s\
  \ out of our hands. Please confirm how you would like to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.5={0}, Allied Command has made an offer - {1} C-Bills in exchange for the\
  \ prisoners we took during the campaign. Their intentions are unknown, but it doesn''t matter.\
  \ What does matter is whether the payout is worth it, or if we have a more valuable use for them\
  \ ourselves. If not, we take the deal and move on.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.6={0}, we can offload the prisoners to Allied Command for {1} C-Bills. There''s\
  \ no indication of what they intend to do with them, but that''s not our concern. The real\
  \ question is whether keeping them benefits us more than the payout. If not, there''s no reason\
  \ to hold onto them."
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.7={0}, Allied Command has put a price of {1} C-Bills on the prisoners. Whatever\
  \ happens to them after the transfer isn''t our problem. We''re leaving this system, and hauling\
  \ captives with us is a liability. Unless we have a compelling reason to keep them, I recommend\
  \ we take the money and be done with it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.8={0}, we have an offer from Allied Command - {1} C-Bills for the prisoners.\
  \ They''re in full retreat, we''re pulling out, and there''s nothing left to gain by holding onto\
  \ them. The payout isn''t significant, but it''s better than nothing. Unless you see another use\
  \ for them, I suggest we accept and move forward.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.9={0}, the prisoners are a nonessential asset, and Allied Command is\
  \ willing to pay {1} C-Bills for them. Given our current situation, there''s little to be gained by\
  \ keeping them. We''re leaving, and they''re dead weight. This is a simple transaction - approve the\
  \ transfer, take the money, and let them deal with it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.10={0}, Allied Command wants the prisoners, and they''re offering {1} C-Bills\
  \ for them. No idea what they plan to do with them, but that''s not our problem. We''re pulling\
  \ out, and dragging captives with us is more trouble than it''s worth. Take the money, hand them\
  \ over, and let''s move on.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.11={0}, we''ve got an offer - {1} C-Bills for the prisoners we picked up. We lost\
  \ this one, and we need to cut loose anything that''s weighing us down. Command can have them, we\
  \ get paid, and we don''t have to worry about what happens next. Seems simple enough.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.12={0}, Allied Command is willing to pay {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. We''re\
  \ done here, and we''ve got bigger concerns than babysitting enemy combatants. We can take the\
  \ payout and be rid of them, or we can drag them along for no good reason. I say we take the deal\
  \ and move on.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.13={0}, Command is willing to pay {1} C-Bills for our prisoners. Whether they\
  \ interrogate them, trade them, or drop them in a ditch somewhere isn''t our concern. We''re\
  \ leaving, and the fewer problems we take with us, the better. If they want them, they can have\
  \ them.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.14={0}, Allied Command''s offering {1} C-Bills to take the prisoners off our\
  \ hands. Not a bad deal, considering we''d just be stuck feeding them otherwise. We''re not in the\
  \ business of holding POWs - we''re in the business of survival. We take the money, we cut our\
  \ losses, and we move on.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.15={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, but they\
  \ aren''t saying what they plan to do with them. That bothers me. If this was just routine\
  \ processing, they''d say so. Instead, they''re keeping us in the dark. Before we sign off on this,\
  \ we should ask ourselves - are we handing them over to something worse?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.16={0}, we''ve got an offer - {1} C-Bills for our prisoners. Command is keeping\
  \ quiet about their plans, and that''s what concerns me. Are these captives just another\
  \ transaction to them, or do they have bigger plans we''re not privy to? Once we hand them over,\
  \ we lose control of the situation. We need to be sure we''re comfortable with that.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.17={0}, Allied Command wants the prisoners and is offering {1} C-Bills, but\
  \ something feels off. They''re in no rush to explain why they want them or what happens next. We\
  \ could be selling them off for intel extractions, black-site interrogations, or worse. If we\
  \ take the deal, we better be sure we can live with whatever comes after.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.18={0}, Command is willing to pay {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, but they''re\
  \ being real quiet about what comes next. That''s never a good sign. If these captives were just a\
  \ clean handoff, why not tell us? Maybe we''re better off keeping them until we know exactly what\
  \ kind of deal we''re making.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.19={0}, the money''s on the table - {1} C-Bills for the prisoners - but the silence\
  \ about their fate is what concerns me. Are they being sent home? Pressed into service? Executed?\
  \ We''re warriors, not executioners. If we go through with this, we need to be sure we''re not\
  \ signing off on something we''ll regret later.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.20={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners we took, and\
  \ they''re not bothering to tell us what happens next. Typical. We fight their war, we take their\
  \ risks, and when it all goes to hell, they throw some pocket change our way and expect us to\
  \ walk away quietly. Feels about right.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.21={0}, Command wants the prisoners, and they''re willing to pay {1} C-Bills.\
  \ Guess that''s the consolation prize for losing this campaign - getting a few scraps while they\
  \ clean up the mess. We bleed for their wars, and this is what we get? Feels less like a deal and\
  \ more like an insult.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.22={0}, they''re offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, like that makes up for\
  \ everything we lost here. No answers, no explanations - just take the money and move along. We get\
  \ used, we get discarded, and now we''re supposed to hand over our last bargaining chip like good\
  \ little mercs. You tell me if that''s worth it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.23={0}, Allied Command wants to buy our prisoners for {1} C-Bills. That''s their\
  \ answer to everything - throw money at the problem and hope we don''t ask too many questions. We\
  \ came in expecting a payday, and now we''re leaving with a payout that barely covers the cost of\
  \ doing business. Some victory.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.24={0}, they want us gone, and they want the prisoners, and they think\
  \ {1} C-Bills is enough to make us forget what happened here. This whole campaign has been one long\
  \ string of bad calls, and now we''re selling off the last thing we have left to show for it.\
  \ Fine. But let''s not pretend this is a win.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.25={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, but they''re\
  \ not saying why. That''s what bothers me. If this was just about cleanup, they''d be upfront about\
  \ it. Instead, they''re keeping quiet. Are these prisoners worth more than we realize? Do they\
  \ know something we don''t? We should think twice before handing them over.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.26={0}, Command wants to take the prisoners off our hands and is\
  \ willing to pay {1} C-Bills. That''s the easy part. The hard part is figuring out why they want them so\
  \ badly. Intel extraction? Political leverage? A quiet execution? They''re keeping us in the dark\
  \ for a reason, and I don''t like making deals blind.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.27={0}, we''re being paid {1} C-Bills to hand over the prisoners, but the lack\
  \ of details is setting off alarms for me. If they were just another batch of POWs, this wouldn''t\
  \ be so secretive. Maybe these people are more valuable than we thought. Maybe Command wants them\
  \ silenced. Either way, I don''t trust this.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.28={0}, the payout is {1} C-Bills, but what''s the real price here? Allied\
  \ Command is eager to take these prisoners, but they won''t say why. That makes me wonder - are we\
  \ handing over valuable intel without knowing it? Are we tying up loose ends for them? We should\
  \ be careful about what we''re selling.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.29={0}, this isn''t sitting right with me. Command''s willing to pay {1} C-Bills\
  \ for the prisoners, but they''re not saying what happens after that. Are they trading them?\
  \ Flipping them? Making them disappear? If this was routine, they wouldn''t be so quiet about it.\
  \ I don''t like getting played.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.30={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, but I keep\
  \ thinking - what happens to them after we hand them over? These people fought against us, but\
  \ they''re still warriors, still human. Do they get a second chance, or are we signing their death\
  \ warrants? Maybe it doesn''t matter. Maybe it should.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.31={0}, we''ve got an offer - {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. On paper, it''s a\
  \ clean deal, but I can''t help but wonder what happens to them next. Are they going home? Being\
  \ locked away? Turned into bargaining chips? We make life-or-death calls in battle, but this one\
  \ feels different. This one feels like it''ll stay with us.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.32={0}, Allied Command is paying {1} C-Bills to take the prisoners off our\
  \ hands. That should be the end of it. But I can''t stop thinking - these people had orders,\
  \ commanders, just like us. They lost. Just like us. And now their fate is up to us. I know we''r\
  e mercs, I know this isn''t our problem, but tell me - doesn''t it feel like it should be?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.33={0}, Command wants the prisoners, and they''re willing to pay {1} C-Bills.\
  \ It''s a fair deal, but I keep wondering - if the tables were turned, if we were the ones being\
  \ handed over, would we want someone to ask where we were going? What happens next? Maybe it''s\
  \ not our place to care. But maybe that''s exactly why we should.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.34={0}, we''re leaving this system behind, and Command wants the\
  \ prisoners. {1} C-Bills is a decent payout, but is that all they''re worth? They had names, ranks, lives\
  \ before this war chewed them up and spit them out. We''re not heroes, and we''re not their saviors\
  \ - but maybe we should at least ask where they''re going before we decide their fate.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.35={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. It''s not\
  \ much, but at this point, does it even matter? We''re bleeding losses on every front - people,\
  \ equipment, reputation. If handing them over gets us even a little bit of stability, maybe\
  \ that''s the best we can hope for.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.36={0}, we''ve got an offer - {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. Feels like another\
  \ scrap thrown our way after everything we''ve lost. We came here expecting a fight, expecting a\
  \ payday, and now we''re leaving with neither. Just sign it over and let''s get out of here before\
  \ this war takes anything else from us.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.37={0}, Command wants the prisoners, and they''ll pay {1} C-Bills. We''re in no\
  \ position to argue, not after how this campaign turned out. Maybe they''ll be useful to someone\
  \ else. Maybe they won''t. Either way, we''re done here. I say we take what we can and move on.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.38={0}, Allied Command is paying {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. It''s a small\
  \ number in a long list of things we''ve had to give up. We lost this fight, and now we''re just\
  \ dealing with the fallout. Whatever happens to them isn''t our concern anymore. Let''s take the\
  \ money and go.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.39={0}, they want the prisoners, and they''re offering {1} C-Bills. Fine. Let\
  \ them have them. I don''t have it in me to care anymore. We came here with plans, and we''re\
  \ leaving with whatever we can scrape together. Just another bad job, just another loss. Let''s be\
  \ done with it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.40={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. It''s a simple\
  \ transaction, but is anything in war ever that simple? We captured them on the battlefield, and\
  \ now we decide their fate - not their commanders, not their own choices. Just us, a handful of\
  \ warriors making a call that will ripple far beyond this contract. Funny how power works.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.41={0}, we''ve got an offer - {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. War turns people into\
  \ assets, bargaining chips, liabilities to be offloaded. These people had orders, just like we\
  \ did. Now their future depends on what benefits us most. Do we take the money and move on, or do\
  \ we ask what happens next? And if we do, does it change anything?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.42={0}, Command wants the prisoners, and they''re willing to pay {1} C-Bills. We\
  \ could take the deal, close this chapter, and move on to the next job. But I wonder - at what\
  \ point do we stop being just soldiers for hire and start being the ones who shape the war\
  \ itself? We''ve been fighting someone else''s battles for so long, maybe we forgot we still have\
  \ choices.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.43={0}, Allied Command is paying {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. A transaction,\
  \ clean and efficient. But I keep wondering - what are we really selling? Information? Leverage? A\
  \ life? When the war is over and the debts are settled, will these people remember us as captors,\
  \ executioners, or the ones who handed them over without a second thought?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.44={0}, they''re offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, and maybe that''s all\
  \ this really is - just another deal, another exchange. But war doesn''t end when the fighting\
  \ stops. The choices we make here, the ones we don''t think about, those are the ones that last.\
  \ We''ve already lost this fight, but maybe the way we finish it still matters.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.45={0}, Allied Command is offering {1} C-Bills for the prisoners, and I say we\
  \ take it. These people fought against us, killed our people, and now they get to sit in a cell\
  \ instead of a grave. If Command wants to deal with them, fine. But if they think they''re walking\
  \ away from this unscathed, they''re dead wrong.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.46={0}, they''re offering {1} C-Bills to take the prisoners off our hands. After\
  \ everything we lost in this fight, after what these people did to our own, I don''t care where\
  \ they end up - so long as they pay for what they''ve done. If Allied Command wants them, then let''s\
  \ hope they don''t intend to go easy on them.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.47={0}, we''re getting {1} C-Bills for turning over the prisoners. It''s not\
  \ enough, but at least it''s something. These bastards left their own to die, and now they have to\
  \ answer for everything they did. We didn''t get our revenge on the battlefield, but maybe this is\
  \ the next best thing.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.48={0}, Allied Command is paying {1} C-Bills for the prisoners. We could\
  \ refuse, keep them, decide their fate ourselves. But we''ve got bigger fights ahead. If handing\
  \ them over ensures they get what they deserve, then I say we take the money and let Command be\
  \ the executioner.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.good.49={0}, the enemy threw everything they had at us, took our people,\
  \ left us bleeding, and now they expect mercy? No. Command is offering {1} C-Bills, and whatever happens\
  \ to them next isn''t our concern - so long as it isn''t leniency. They chose this war, now they get\
  \ to live with the consequences.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.0={0}, the enemy has contacted us with a demand for the return of their\
  \ captured personnel. They have stated that they will not provide compensation in exchange. No\
  \ further conditions or negotiations were offered. Awaiting your decision on how to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.1={0}, we have received a formal request from the enemy for the\
  \ immediate return of all prisoners in our custody. They have made it clear that they will not\
  \ offer any form of payment or concessions. There are no explicit threats attached to the\
  \ request. Standing by for orders.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.2={0}, the enemy is demanding the return of their personnel. They have\
  \ refused to compensate us in any way for their release. No additional terms have been specified.\
  \ Please advise on how you wish to proceed.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.3={0}, a transmission from enemy leadership has been received. They are\
  \ requesting the unconditional return of all POWs taken during the campaign. They have stated\
  \ that they will not be offering any payment or concessions in return. No deadline or\
  \ consequences have been mentioned. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.4={0}, the enemy has formally demanded the repatriation of all their\
  \ captured personnel. They have made it clear that they will not provide any form of compensation\
  \ in exchange. No further details or stipulations have been provided. Standing by for your\
  \ response.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.5={0}, the enemy has demanded the return of their captured personnel and\
  \ refuses to offer compensation. As it stands, we have no incentive to comply unless we see\
  \ strategic value in doing so. If we release them, we gain nothing. If we keep them, they could\
  \ still be useful as leverage in the future. Recommend considering all angles before making a\
  \ decision.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.6={0}, we''ve received a demand for the return of enemy POWs. They''re\
  \ refusing to compensate us, which means we have no immediate gain in complying. If we return\
  \ them, we remove a potential liability, but we also lose any bargaining power they might\
  \ provide. If we refuse, we need to be prepared for potential retaliation. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.7={0}, the enemy wants their people back but isn''t willing to pay. That\
  \ tells me they either assume we have no choice but to comply, or they''re testing our resolve. We\
  \ could hand them over and be done with it, or we could hold onto them and see if their tune\
  \ changes. Either way, this should be treated as a negotiation, not a demand.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.8={0}, the enemy has contacted us demanding the return of their captured\
  \ personnel with no offer of compensation. Releasing them gains us nothing unless we expect\
  \ goodwill or future leverage, neither of which are likely. If we intend to keep them, we should\
  \ determine whether they pose a risk or an asset. Recommend assessing their value before\
  \ responding.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.9={0}, we have a demand for prisoner repatriation, but the enemy is\
  \ refusing to compensate us. The question is whether holding onto them benefits us more than\
  \ returning them. If we comply, we remove a logistical burden, but if we refuse, they remain a\
  \ potential bargaining tool. We should decide based on what strengthens our position, not on\
  \ sentiment.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.10={0}, the enemy is demanding their prisoners back and refusing to pay.\
  \ No surprise there. They won the fight, so now they think they can dictate the terms. We can\
  \ hand them over and cut our losses, or we can keep them and see if that makes them squirm.\
  \ Either way, this isn''t about fairness - it''s about what works for us.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.11={0}, we''ve got a message from the enemy - return the prisoners, no\
  \ payment. Standard arrogance from a side that thinks they''ve already won. We can give them what\
  \ they want and be done with it, or we make it clear we don''t take orders from anyone. Either\
  \ way, let''s not waste time pretending they''re negotiating in good faith.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.12={0}, the enemy wants their people back and isn''t offering a damn\
  \ thing in return. Not unexpected. We''re already on the way out, so the only question is whether\
  \ holding onto them gets us anything. If not, we dump them and move on. No point dragging dead\
  \ weight.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.13={0}, the enemy says they want their prisoners back, and they''re not\
  \ willing to pay. Typical. They assume we''ll roll over just because we lost this fight. Maybe we\
  \ do, maybe we don''t, but let''s not act like this is anything more than another power move. We\
  \ play it smart, not sentimental.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.14={0}, we''ve got a demand from the enemy - give back their people, no\
  \ compensation. We''re warriors, not charity workers, but dragging prisoners along doesn''t do us\
  \ any favors either. If we let them go, it''s because it makes sense for us, not because they told\
  \ us to. Your call.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.15={0}, the enemy is demanding their prisoners back but refusing to\
  \ offer anything in return. That alone is enough to make me suspicious. If these people were\
  \ expendable, they wouldn''t care. So why the sudden urgency? Are these captives worth more than\
  \ we realize? Before we make a decision, we should ask ourselves what we''re missing.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.16={0}, we''ve received a demand for the return of enemy POWs. No offer\
  \ of compensation, no negotiation - just an expectation. That tells me either they think they hold\
  \ all the power, or they don''t want us asking too many questions. Do these prisoners know\
  \ something we don''t? Are we sitting on leverage without realizing it?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.17={0}, the enemy wants their people back but won''t pay for them. That''s\
  \ not how this usually works. Either they think we''re too weak to argue, or these prisoners are\
  \ more valuable than they''re letting on. Maybe we should push back and see how badly they really\
  \ want them.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.18={0}, the demand just came in - return their personnel, no compensation.\
  \ I don''t buy it. If they didn''t care, they''d leave them behind. If they cared too much, they''d\
  \ be offering something. Instead, they''re stonewalling, which means there''s something here they\
  \ don''t want us looking into. We should be careful about how we handle this.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.19=0}, the enemy expects us to hand over the prisoners for nothing, and\
  \ that''s what bothers me. They won the fight, but this demand reeks of desperation. Do they need\
  \ these people for something? Are they trying to cover something up? Whatever the case, we\
  \ shouldn''t rush into a decision without knowing the full picture.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.20={0}, the enemy just sent their demands - give back their prisoners, no\
  \ compensation. After everything they''ve taken from us, now they have the nerve to demand\
  \ something from us? They won this fight, wasn''t that enough? Apparently not. Now they expect us\
  \ to do them favors for free.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.21={0}, we just got word from the enemy. They want their people back and\
  \ aren''t offering a damn thing in return. Figures. They crush us, run us out of the system, and\
  \ now they think they can snap their fingers and we''ll hand over what little we have left.\
  \ Typical arrogance.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.22={0}, the enemy is demanding their prisoners back - no deal, no\
  \ compensation, just expecting us to roll over and comply. They took this fight from us, they\
  \ took our people, our resources, our shot at winning. Now they want more. Makes you wonder if\
  \ they''d be so generous if things were reversed.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.23={0}, we''re getting orders from the same bastards who just ran us into\
  \ the ground. Give back their people, no payment, no negotiation. They already bled us dry, but I\
  \ guess that wasn''t enough. Now they expect us to play nice while they take whatever else they\
  \ can.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.24={0}, the enemy is calling in favors they haven''t earned. They want\
  \ their prisoners, but they refuse to pay, because why would they? They know we''re on our way\
  \ out. They know we don''t have much left to bargain with. So now they think they can take what\
  \ they want, same as they took everything else.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.25={0}, the enemy has the audacity to demand their prisoners back -\
  \ without offering a single thing in return. After what they did to us? After the lives they\
  \ took? They don''t deserve our cooperation. They didn''t show us any mercy, so why should we give\
  \ them any now? Let them rot.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.26={0}, they want their people back. No payment, no negotiations - just\
  \ demands. After everything they''ve done, they expect us to just hand them over? They burned our\
  \ people, crushed our forces, and now they think they''re entitled to kindness? They don''t deserve\
  \ it. If they want their people back so badly, let them suffer for it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.27={0}, the enemy is ordering us to release their prisoners like they''re\
  \ still calling the shots. Like they didn''t just run us into the ground. They didn''t hesitate to\
  \ take from us, to kill without mercy. And now they expect us to play fair? No. They made their\
  \ choice. Let them feel what it''s like to lose.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.28={0}, they''ve sent their demand - return their people, no compensation.\
  \ They seem to think this war is over, that we''ll just fall in line and comply. But this doesn''t\
  \ feel over to me. Not after what they did. Not after what we lost. They deserve nothing from us\
  \ but the same kind of suffering they handed out.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.29={0}, the enemy is making demands like they''ve earned the right. They\
  \ haven''t. We may have lost this fight, but that doesn''t mean we have to roll over and give them\
  \ what they want. They didn''t offer mercy when they had the upper hand, and I see no reason why\
  \ we should now. Let them taste their own cruelty.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.30=0}, the enemy is demanding their prisoners back but refusing to pay.\
  \ That alone makes me wonder - why do they want them so badly? If they were just rank-and-file\
  \ soldiers, they wouldn''t care. Are these prisoners more valuable than we thought? Are we handing\
  \ back spies, operatives, or someone they need silenced? I don''t like the feel of this.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.31={0}, we got a demand from the enemy - return their people, no\
  \ compensation, no discussion. Why now? Why the urgency? Either these prisoners know something we\
  \ don''t, or the enemy wants them back before we figure it out. If we let them go without knowing\
  \ why they want them so badly, we might be making a mistake.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.32={0}, something about this stinks. The enemy beat us, ran us out, and\
  \ now suddenly they''re demanding we return their people - for free. Feels too convenient. Maybe\
  \ these prisoners have intel they don''t want slipping out. Maybe they''ve been turned and are\
  \ working for them now. Either way, I don''t trust it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.33={0}, they want their people back, and they''re not offering anything\
  \ in return. That''s not just arrogance - it''s confidence. Why? Do these prisoners know something\
  \ they don''t want getting out? Are they part of some plan we''re not seeing? Before we make a\
  \ decision, we should ask ourselves: are we being played?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.34={0}, we''ve got a problem. The enemy is demanding their prisoners back\
  \ with no compensation, no bargaining, just pure expectation. That tells me they either know\
  \ something we don''t, or they''re using this to test our reaction. Either way, we need to tread\
  \ carefully - because I don''t think this is just about the prisoners.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.35={0}, the enemy wants their people back, and they''re offering us\
  \ nothing in return. Just another demand, another reminder that we lost this fight. But this\
  \ isn''t just about them - it''s about us. About who we are. We can let our anger decide, or we can\
  \ be better than they were. Maybe mercy doesn''t pay, but maybe it still matters.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.36={0}, they''re demanding their prisoners back with nothing in return.\
  \ Feels like an insult, after what they put us through. But I keep thinking - these prisoners, they\
  \ were just soldiers like us, following orders, fighting for their side the same way we did. Do\
  \ we let them go and end this war on our terms, or do we hold onto the last bit of control we\
  \ have left?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.37={0}, we''ve lost a lot in this campaign. Too much. And now the enemy\
  \ is here, telling us to hand over the last thing we''ve got left, like it''s nothing. We could say\
  \ no out of spite, out of pride - but what does that make us? If we do this, let''s do it because we\
  \ choose to, not because they demand it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.38={0}, they''re not offering us anything, just telling us to give back\
  \ their people like we owe them something. We don''t. But I keep thinking - if the roles were\
  \ reversed, if we had people in their hands, would we want someone to ask these same questions?\
  \ Maybe it''s not about what they deserve. Maybe it''s about what kind of unit we want to be.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.39={0}, the enemy has given their demand: return the prisoners, no\
  \ payment, no negotiations. It''d be easy to say no, to leave them with nothing just like they\
  \ left us. But what does that prove? We''ve already lost this battle. Maybe the only real victory\
  \ left is deciding for ourselves how we want to end it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.40={0}, the enemy is demanding we return their prisoners and, of course,\
  \ they''re not offering a damn thing in return. Just another kick while we''re already down. At\
  \ this point, I don''t even know if it''s worth the fight. We''re leaving this system with nothing -\
  \ what''s one more thing taken from us?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.41={0}, we just got word from the enemy. They want their people back, no\
  \ compensation, no negotiation. I''d like to be angry about it. However, honestly, I''m too damn\
  \ tired. We''ve lost this fight, and we both know they''re going to get what they want one way or\
  \ another. Maybe it''s better to just let this go and be done with it.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.42={0}, they want their people, and they won''t pay for them. Figures.\
  \ We''re barely holding this company together as it is, and now we''re supposed to argue over\
  \ prisoners? I don''t see the point. We lost, {0}. This is just one more thing slipping through\
  \ our fingers.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.43={0}, the enemy sent their demand - return their prisoners, no payment,\
  \ no options. Honestly, I don''t even have the energy to be outraged. We fought, we lost, and now\
  \ we''re crawling out of this system with whatever scraps we can carry. What does it matter if we\
  \ hand them over? We''ve got bigger problems ahead.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.44={0}, another insult to add to the pile. They get to dictate terms,\
  \ and we get to swallow our pride - again. We could hold out, refuse, make some kind of stand, but\
  \ for what? We''re beaten, we''re leaving, and soon this whole mess will just be another bad\
  \ memory. Maybe it''s time to cut our losses and move on.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.45={0}, the enemy is demanding their prisoners back, refusing to pay as\
  \ if they''re entitled to them. Makes you wonder - what is a prisoner really worth? Are they\
  \ bargaining chips, liabilities, or just another piece of war we pass back and forth? We could\
  \ keep them, we could hand them over, but in the end, does it change anything?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.46={0}, they want their people back, but they''re not offering anything\
  \ in return. Typical. It''s strange how war makes people valuable one moment and disposable the\
  \ next. We fought to take these prisoners, now we''re expected to just hand them over. Maybe\
  \ that''s the real game - none of us are as important as we think we are.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.47={0}, the enemy is demanding the return of their captured personnel,\
  \ no compensation, no discussion. It''s funny, isn''t it? When we were on the battlefield, these\
  \ people were our enemies, targets in our sights. Now they''re just bodies in a holding cell,\
  \ waiting for someone else to decide their fate. Maybe war was never about killing - just about\
  \ control.
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.48={0}, the demand is in - return the prisoners, no payment, no\
  \ compromise. We could refuse, hold onto them as some last shred of power in a war we''ve already\
  \ lost. But does that really matter? In the grand scheme of things, does keeping or releasing a\
  \ few soldiers shift the balance, or are we just convincing ourselves it does?
prisoners.enemy.defeat.bad.49={0}, another choice with no right answer. The enemy wants their\
  \ prisoners back without offering anything in return. Maybe this is just how war works - the\
  \ winners take, the losers give, and the cycle repeats. If we refuse, does it make us strong? If\
  \ we comply, does it make us weak? Or is it all just another move in a game we never had a chance\
  \ of winning?
