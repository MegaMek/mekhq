  <p>I won''t waste your time with ceremony. You''ve never cared much for pomp, and neither do I - not when the Inner \
  Sphere is coming apart at the seams.</p>\
  <p>You know who I am. You know what I''ve done. And you know this message isn''t coming through diplomatic channels \
  because this is not a conversation for diplomats. This is a choice - yours.</p>\
  <p>Let''s speak plainly.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Commonwealth is dead. Victor may still clutch at its corpse, but his absence, his naive allegiance\
  \ to ComStar, and his actions against the Clans have gutted its soul. He''s a good man - but a ghost of a ruler. He\
  \ left us leaderless, rudderless, and bleeding. I stepped in because someone had to.</p>\
  <p>I see a future. A leaner, stronger, more self-determined realm - the <b>Lyran Alliance</b>. Not a union of \
  convenience. Not a half-broken marriage of distant ideals. A nation worthy of its warriors, its citizens, and its \
  legacy.</p>\
  <p>Now I''m asking you to choose that future.</p>\
  <p>I know your record, {1}. You built <b>{18}</b> out of scrap and stubbornness. You''ve fought for the \
  Commonwealth, but more than that - you''ve fought for your people. For every tech, every pilot, every quartermaster \
  who kept your unit alive through hell.</p>\
  <p>You don''t serve politics. You serve principle.</p>\
  <p>And that''s exactly what I need right now.</p>\
  <p>The Lyran Alliance is not asking for your allegiance. <b>I am.</b></p>\
  <p>You and <b>{18}</b> would be granted full status within the Alliance Armed Forces, with expanded logistical \
  support and a direct command contract - no noble leashes, no Davion second-guessing. You''ll answer only to me. I know\
  \ how to reward loyalty - and how to protect those who commit early, when the stakes are highest.</p>\
  <p>Others will hesitate. They''ll wait and watch, afraid of history books that haven''t been written yet. But you - \
  you''ve always written your own chapter.</p>\
  <p><b>Join me, <b>{0}</b>.</b></p>\
  <p>Bring <b>{18}</b> home to Tharkad, and I will make sure your unit is never left in the dark again - never \
      left waiting for orders that never come, or reinforcements that never mattered.</p>\
  <p>Let''s build something that lasts.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.FED_COM_CIVIL_WAR.for={22},\
  <p>I''ve reviewed the Archon''s message - and I believe we should take her at her word.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Commonwealth we were sworn to serve doesn''t exist anymore. The alliance is broken. Victor \
  abandoned us to chase ghosts while Tharkad and New Avalon drifted further apart with every passing month. Now the \
  division is official, and we''re sitting here pretending it hasn''t already happened.</p>\
  <p>Katrina may not be perfect, but she''s here. She''s present. She''s taking the shot when it matters. That''s more \
  than I can say for most of High Command.</p>\
  <p>Her offer isn''t just politics - it''s survival. A stable Lyran Alliance means stable contracts, logistics, and \
  protection for our families. And if we move early, we get leverage. She said it herself: first movers write their \
  own chapter.</p>\
  <p>We''ve lost too much waiting for someone to remember we''re out here. Katrina remembers. She called us by name. \
  You think she pulled <b>{18}</b> out of a hat? She knows what we''ve done. She wants what we bring.</p>\
  <p>Let the others hesitate. Let them straddle the line. We take a side now, and we''re not just another unit \
  scrounging for scraps - we''re a foundation stone in something new. Something that might actually hold.</p>\
  <p>I trust your judgment, {22}. Always have. But for what it''s worth: I''m ready to ride for Tharkad.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.FED_COM_CIVIL_WAR.against={22},\
  <p>I understand you''re weighing Archon Steiner''s offer. I''ve reviewed her message and considered the \
  implications, and I feel it''s my duty to speak clearly before any final decision is made.</p>\
  <p>If we commit to her - to the Lyran Alliance - I will not go with you.</p>\
  <p>This is not rebellion, and it is not an ultimatum. It is clarity.</p>\
  <p>I respect your leadership. You''ve earned every inch of loyalty from this unit and from me. But Katrina''s rise is\
  \ not a movement I believe in. I''ve watched her maneuver her way to power through spin and sabotage, and I do not \
  trust the foundation she''s building.</p>\
  <p>If <b>{18}</b> align with her, we will become a political weapon. No matter what terms she offers, we will \
  not be free. We will be pointed. Used. Justified as proof that her actions were right all along.</p>\
  <p>Should you choose that path, I will resign my commission and seek honorable discharge. Quietly, cleanly, without\
  \ division. I''ll help with any transition needed, but I won''t follow orders that lead me down that road.</p>\
  <p>I share this now so there are no surprises. No confusion. No bitterness. You deserve honest counsel, and this is\
  \ mine.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.FED_COM_CIVIL_WAR.newsFor=<h2 style="text-align:center">BREAKING: Elite FedCom Unit Declares for \
  Lyran Alliance</h2>\
  <p>In a stunning development that is rippling across military and political channels alike, the elite independent \
  regiment known as <b>{18}</b> has officially pledged its allegiance to Archon Katrina Steiner and the newly \
  redeclared Lyran Alliance.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> issued a brief statement confirming the shift, citing "clear leadership, direct engagement, and a \
  stabilizing vision for the Inner Sphere" as core reasons for the unit''s alignment with the Archon.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>, a veteran unit with deep combat experience and a reputation for independent tactical \
  integrity, had long operated under Federated Commonwealth command. Their shift signals not just military \
  realignment - but ideological rupture within what remains of the once-mighty FedCom union.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"This isn''t just one unit changing flags. This is a vote of no confidence in the entire Davion \
  command structure." - Dr. Yusef Tenbrin, Military Analyst, New Avalon Institute of Science</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Sources within the Lyran High Command report that the unit will be redeployed shortly - though official \
  confirmation has not been provided.</p>\
  <p>News of <b>{18}</b>'' defection has ignited heated debate across FedCom-aligned worlds. With pro-Davion \
  governors calling the move "treasonous," while others, particularly on Lyran border worlds, have expressed support \
  for the unit''s decision to follow a more assertive and local leadership model.</p>\
  <p>In New Avalon, sources within Prince Victor Steiner-Davion''s inner circle say the development is "deeply \
  concerning," but stopped short of condemning the commander directly. No formal response has been issued by the AFFS\
  \ High Command as of this writing.</p>\
  <p>Not all voices within <b>{18}</b> were aligned. Leaked communications reveal that the unit''s second in \
  command, <b>{9}</b>, opposed the shift and has reportedly submitted {16} intent to resign.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"Katrina doesn''t want soldiers. She wants symbols." - Excerpt from <b>{9}</b>'' internal \
  transmission, now circulating in strategic forums</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The internal split is being watched closely by military analysts, who fear that similar fractures may erupt in \
  other mixed-allegiance units stationed near contested territories.</p>\
  <p>The timing of <b>{18}</b>'' defection is critical. With border tensions flaring between Lyran and Capellan \
  forces, and pirate raids escalating in the Periphery, the realignment gives Katrina both a symbolic and practical\
  \ advantage - one she may leverage to draw further support from unaffiliated or wavering regiments.</p>\
  <p>Whether this is the first domino or an isolated break remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: a FedCom \
  Civil War is no longer a hypothetical. It''s already begun.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.FED_COM_CIVIL_WAR.newsAgainst=<h2 style="text-align:center">Renowned Unit Rejects Archon''s Bid</h2>\
  <p>In a move with major implications for the fractured House Steiner-Davion political order, the elite combat unit \
  known as <b>{18}</b> has officially declined Archon Katrina Steiner''s invitation to join the newly redeclared \
  Lyran Alliance.</p>\
  <p>The announcement came late last night, following what sources described as "tense internal debate" among the \
  unit''s senior staff. <b>{0}</b> issued a brief transmission declaring <b>{18}</b>'' continued loyalty to the\
  \ Federated Commonwealth and Prince Victor Steiner-Davion''s legitimate authority.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We serve a united vision," the statement read. "We do not take orders from those who shatter what others bled \
  to build."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had been heavily courted by Lyran political agents over the last several weeks, with Archon \
  Katrina herself delivering a direct, classified offer to the unit. Analysts describe the rejection as a "severe \
  blow" to Katrina''s campaign to bring high-profile military assets under her banner in the early stages of what is \
  rapidly escalating towards a civil war.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b>, the {1}''s second in command, is believed to have been a vocal opponent of the alliance shift, \
  describing the offer as "a political weapon dressed up as a rescue mission." {11} reportedly told <b>{0}</b> {12} \
  would resign {16} post if the unit changed sides - though such a resignation was ultimately unnecessary.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"This decision wasn''t about loyalty to a flag - it was about recognizing who''s trying to preserve \
  peace, and who''s burning bridges for a throne." - Internal source close to <b>{18}</b> command</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Military observers expect the rejection to bolster morale in Davion-aligned commands and potentially sway other \
  hesitant units still weighing Katrina''s overtures. <b>{18}</b> are respected not just for their combat record,\
  \ but for their fiercely independent code of honor - making their refusal all the more symbolic.</p>\
  <p>Still, tensions remain high. Lyran Defense Force patrols near the frontier have doubled in the past 48 hours, \
  and at least one Davion logistical convoy was turned away from a Tharkad-run depot without explanation.</p>\
  <p>Sources within the AFFS suggest <b>{18}</b> may be redeployed to reinforce vulnerable worlds along the \
  Terran corridor, a sign that High Command intends to solidify its core before any formal engagements occur.</p>\
  <p>Whether Katrina''s forces respond with diplomacy - or escalation - remains to be seen. But with every decision like \
  this, the center of the Federated Commonwealth either holds... or cracks.</p>\

FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.COMSTAR_SCHISM.initialOffer=<h2 style="text-align:center">Transmitted via HPG Node - Priority \
  Omega Directive</h2>\
  <h3><b>From:</b> Precentor Demona Aziz, Voice of the Word, Servant of the Light\
  <br>Location:</b> Atreus (FWL)\
  <br>Date:</b> September 21, 3052</h3>\
  <p><b>To the faithful, the questioning, and those who still honor the flame of Blake</b></p>\
  <p>The veil has fallen. The heresy is no longer hidden. I come not to whisper, but to reveal.</p>\
  <p>Primus Myndo Waterly, chosen steward of Blake''s Will, was <b>murdered</b> - assassinated by the traitor \
  <b>Anastasius Focht</b> with the blessing of the secularist Sharilar Mori. Her blood was spilled within the \
  sanctum, and her memory is now buried beneath lies and "reform."</p>\
  <p>They speak of peace. Of neutrality. Of modernity. But what they have done is nothing less than <b>apostasy</b>. \
  They have stripped ComStar of its soul and draped it in sterile robes. They make deals with the Clans. They abandon\
  \ the Covenant. They spit on prophecy.</p>\
  <p>Let this message burn through every node of this shattered Sphere:</p>\
  <p><b>We do not recognize the authority of the usurpers on Terra.</b> We reject the puppet Primus. We reject \
  Focht''s secularist ComStar. We reject the surrender of spirit in favor of political convenience.</p>\
  <p><b>We are the Word of Blake.</b></p>\
  <p>We carry forward the sacred mission unbroken - from Jerome Blake to Myndo Waterly and now to us. On Atreus, we \
  have established the Seat of the True Word. We will guard the sacred knowledge. We will preserve the Code. And we \
  will not bow to those who murdered our faith in the name of diplomacy.</p>\
  <p>This is not rebellion. This is <i>reclamation</i>.</p>\
  <p>To those who still hold Blake in their hearts, your silence is no longer righteous. Join us. Find your calling \
  again. Our sanctuaries are open, our archives intact, our purpose clear.</p>\
  <p>To those who follow the false ComStar: you may own the machines, but you have lost the Message. We do not seek \
  your war - but we will not retreat from our truth.</p>\
  <p>Mark these words, and mark this day. The Word has not ended. It has been reborn.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.COMSTAR_SCHISM.for={22},\
  <p>I read the transmission three times before I believed it. Then I read the encoded brief from Atreus. I \
  cross-verified Waterly''s death certificate - if you can even call it that.</p>\
  <p>She was <b>murdered</b>, {22}. Shot in the back by Anastasius Focht. Covered up by Sharilar Mori. All while \
  the so-called "reformers" smiled for the press and handed our sacred legacy over to Clan filth and secular \
  bureaucrats.</p>\
  <p>I can''t stomach it. I won''t.</p>\
  <p>You always said <b>{18}</b> stood for something more than orders. That we were about loyalty. Principle. \
  Truth. If that''s still true - <i>if that ever meant anything</i> - then I''m asking you to act now, before this unit is\
  \ dragged into a political lie dressed in protocol and neutrality.</p>\
  <p>Precentor Demona Aziz has called the faithful home. The <b>Word of Blake</b> isn''t a fringe cult. It''s what''s \
  left of the soul they tried to kill with Waterly. It''s the real mission. The true message. And they''re not asking \
  for blind loyalty - they''re offering clarity. A place to stand that isn''t made of compromise and cowardice.</p>\
  <p>You still have time to lead us there. To make the call. But I won''t lie to you: if we keep pretending neutrality\
  \ is honorable in the face of <b>murder and heresy</b>, some of us will stop pretending. I''m not the only one \
  who''s made up their mind. Others are watching. Others are <i>ready</i></p>\
  <p>This is the last moment before the line is drawn, {22}. Cross it with purpose - or be left behind.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.COMSTAR_SCHISM.against={22},\
  <p>I know you''re receiving pressure from all sides, especially from those swept up by Precentor Aziz''s broadcast. \
  You''ve always listened to both sides. I trust you''ll hear this one too - before we mistake grief and outrage for \
  truth.</p>\
  <p>I read the same message. I saw the same claims. And I understand why people are shaken. The death of Myndo \
  Waterly - however tragic - is not proof of conspiracy. But this conspiracy <i>is</i> proof of crisis.</p>\
  <p>What the Precentor Martial did, he did under scrutiny. He presented the circumstances of Waterly''s final actions\
  \ and the justification for intervention to the <b>First Circuit</b>. Not in shadows. Not with daggers. With \
  <i>evidence</i> - and the weight of Jerome Blake''s original writings behind him.</p>\
  <p>I''ve read the Blake Codex. It was never about gods. It was about <b>preservation, reason, restraint</b>. He \
  feared the cycle of destruction, and he built ComStar to be the eye in the storm, not a flaming sword in it.</p>\
  <p>What Aziz is building isn''t a faith - it''s a fortress. She''s taking Waterly''s death and wrapping it in myth, \
  calling it martyrdom so she can seize control without oversight. It''s not prophecy - it''s a <b>power grab</b>.</p>\
  <p>I say this with conviction: <b>now is not the time to go back into Plato''s cave.</b> We''ve fought for \
  clarity. For truth earned in the blood and fire of Tukayyid. This moment - this messy, complicated, rational moment \
  - is <b>the light</b>. To follow Aziz is to turn away from it because it''s too bright, too hard, too \
  uncomfortable.</p>\
  <p>If others can''t see that, I pity them. But I hope you still can. I know you taught me to.</p>\
  <p>We''re soldiers. We''re not prophets. Let''s not mistake shouting for wisdom.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.COMSTAR_SCHISM.newsFor=<h2 style="text-align:center">ComStar Cracks: A Schism Shakes the Sphere</h2>\
  <p>ComStar, long the seemingly untouchable guardian of interstellar communication and spiritual stewardship, has \
  fractured. What began as quiet discontent within Terra''s ivory halls has become a rupture felt across the Inner \
  Sphere - and the consequences may be only just beginning.</p>\
  <p>A respected ComGuard unit, known as <b>{18}</b>, has announced its defection - not just from ComStar command, \
  but from the entire secular direction it has taken under Primus Sharilar Mori and Precentor Martial Anastasius \
  Focht. Their allegiance now lies with a splinter faction calling itself <b>the Word of Blake</b>.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We serve the true mission," said a brief statement from <b>{18}</b>. "And we will not be \
  complicit in the burial of truth beneath protocol and public relations."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Led by former Precentor Demona Aziz, the Word of Blake has claimed moral succession to Jerome Blake''s vision. \
  While the Mori-Focht administration insists on a secular, non-religious mandate for ComStar, the Word claims that \
  the recent reforms represent a betrayal - not progress.</p>\
  <p>Aziz''s followers are not merely disillusioned bureaucrats. They''ve taken with them HPG technicians, ComStar \
  archivists, and - most dangerously - military personnel. Several ComGuard units have quietly gone silent. \
  <b>{18}</b> are simply the first to go public.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>When spiritual extremists seize logistical infrastructure, that''s not a religious debate. That''s \
  a security crisis." - Dr. Helena Tarns, Strategic Risk Council, Lyran Alliance</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Rumors swirl that Word of Blake forces are consolidating on Atreus in the Free Worlds League, with Free Worlds \
  officials either unable or unwilling to publicly intervene. In some cases, Word personnel have reportedly taken \
  control of local HPG relays under "emergency continuity protocols."</p>\
  <p>The heart of the crisis lies in one chilling question: <b>Who controls the HPG network?</b></p>\
  <p>ComStar''s promise - its power - has always rested on neutrality. From the Periphery to Tharkad, communication \
  across light-years depended on that neutrality. Now, with Word of Blake operatives occupying some nodes and ComStar\
  \ loyalists holding others, coordination is fragmenting.</p>\
  <p>The First Circuit has issued reassurances that most of the Inner Sphere''s primary data corridors remain stable. \
  But military planners are already preparing contingency protocols for a future in which message traffic is no \
  longer guaranteed or secure.</p>\
  <p>Some analysts see this as the collapse of the so-called "Invisible Empire" - a recent idea that ComStar has \
  been quietly steering the fate of the Inner Sphere through control of both technology and truth. If ComStar can no \
  longer speak with one voice, let alone protect its own unity, what remains of its mystique?</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We may be witnessing the final unraveling of Blake''s order," said Professor Ren Takagawa of the \
  University of Luthien. "Or the birth of a new war, one of ideology, fought not over territory - but over \
  meaning."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>For now, ComStar remains in control of Terra and the majority of the core HPG hubs. But the Word of Blake''s \
  influence is spreading - particularly in systems disillusioned with ComStar''s recent compromises with the Clans and \
  actions taken against House sovereignty.</p>\
  <p>The defection of <b>{18}</b> - respected, decorated, and fiercely independent - sends a chilling signal to \
  others who may be wavering.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"If a ComGuard unit walks away from Terra''s command to join a theocratic movement, what''s stopping \
  the next twenty?" - Lt. General Mira Feldt, 1st Davion Guards</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>One thing is clear: the age of unquestioned ComStar authority is over. The Inner Sphere must now ask itself if \
  it''s ready for a galaxy where the lines between belief, bandwidth, and battle are no longer cleanly drawn.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.COMSTAR_SCHISM.newsAgainst=<h2 style="text-align:center"><b>{18}</b> Reject Word of Blake, \
  Back ComStar Unity</h2>\
  <p>As the Word of Blake splinter group continues its campaign to recruit ComGuard personnel and seize \
  communications hubs, one of ComStar''s most respected independent units has drawn a clear line.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>, a semi-autonomous ComGuard unit, issued a public statement today condemning the Word of Blake \
  movement and reaffirming their loyalty to the secular leadership of ComStar under Primus Sharilar Mori and \
  Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i>"We will not trade reason for ritual. We will not follow fanatics into the dark." - <b>{0}</b>, \
  <b>{18}</b></i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{0}</b>''s statement directly addressed recent outreach from Word of Blake operatives, including a widely \
  distributed HPG message from Precentor Demona Aziz calling for ComGuards to "preserve the true faith" and abandon \
  the "heretic leadership on Terra."</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We''ve seen the so-called truth," {1} added. "We''ve read the same Blake Codex they twist to justify power grabs \
  and cult rhetoric. What the Precentor Martial showed the First Circuit wasn''t heresy. It was clarity. What Aziz \
  offers is the same old tyranny - only with scripture for bullets."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>'' declaration comes at a critical moment, as several lesser-known ComGuard elements have \
  reportedly gone silent, with unconfirmed reports of defections and rogue operations along the Free Worlds League \
  frontier.</p>\
  <p>By going public, <b>{18}</b> have become the first high-profile military unit to reject Word of Blake \
  ideology while remaining fully operational within the ComStar structure. Sources within Terra suggest the First \
  Circuit views this move as a morale-boosting victory amid the ongoing ideological battle.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"The Word of Blake has momentum - but <b>{18}</b> have weight," said sociopolitical analyst\
  \ Ayra Simlen. "They''re combat-proven, independent, and respected. Their refusal gives others permission to say no \
  without feeling like traitors to faith or tradition."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Word of Blake supporters continue to push the narrative that secularization is a betrayal of Blake''s intent, \
  citing Myndo Waterly''s death as martyrdom. But <b>{18}</b>'' intelligence branch released a redacted briefing \
  alongside their statement, supporting Focht''s timeline of events and reiterating that Waterly was removed for \
  authorizing <i>Operation Scorpion</i>, a plan widely condemned as genocidal and destabilizing.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b>, of <b>{18}</b>, issued {16} own remarks: "We all want meaning. But there is no honor in \
  setting fire to the institutions that protect the Sphere just because the light makes you uncomfortable. We will \
  not confuse zeal for truth."</p>\
  <p>The schism has raised fears over the stability of the HPG network, but units like <b>{18}</b> remaining \
  loyal may be a key factor in holding the line - both technologically and ideologically.</p>\
  <p>In response to mounting public anxiety about the reliability of interstellar communications, ComStar issued an \
  official statement through its Terra-based press office:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"There is no danger to the HPG network - <b>not now, not ever</b>. The Inner Sphere''s lines of \
  communication remain fully operational and under the stewardship of ComStar. The sanctity of the network is our \
  highest duty, and no amount of splinter ideology will change that." - ComStar Public Affairs</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Analysts remain cautious. While the majority of HPG nodes remain secure, scattered incidents of regional \
  interference and "unusual transmission patterns" have already been reported near Capellan and Free Worlds \
  territories - many suspected to be under Word of Blake influence.</p>\
  <p>Still, <b>{18}</b>'' firm rejection of Blakist ideology provides a rare point of reassurance. Whether others \
  will follow <b>{18}</b>'' example - or fall under the sway of the Word - remains to be seen. But \
  one thing is now undeniable: the fight for ComStar''s soul is no longer just theological. It is logistical, \
  operational, and real.</p>
# ESPINOSA_COUP
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.ESPINOSA_COUP.initialOffer=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>By now you''ve heard my public address. Let me repeat what matters most:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"With the unanimous support of the Founding Houses, I have assumed control of the Aurigan \
  Coalition."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>This was not a coup. It was a correction. The Founding Houses have seen the truth - seen the danger of Kamea \
  Arano''s naive vision. Her heart may be noble, but noble hearts make poor shields in the Periphery. She would have \
  plunged us into weakness, disunity, and external manipulation.</p>\
  <p>I did not take power for ambition''s sake. I took it because someone had to. Because stability matters. Because \
  the Coalition must be strong if it is to survive the decades ahead. And I will not allow it to crumble under \
  romantic slogans and inherited titles.</p>\
  <p>You, {22}, understand the price of disorder. The cost of hesitation. You lead a professional unit with \
  reach and influence. I know what <b>{18}</b> are capable of. I know how valuable your presence could \
  be to the Directorate.</p>\
  <p>So I''m offering you this, once: join us. Pledge your strength to me and the Aurigan Directorate, and you will \
  receive a full formal commission, prioritized resupply, and a command charter under Directorate Strategic Command. \
  You''ll maintain operational freedom - and more importantly, you''ll help secure the Reach against collapse.</p>\
  <p>But hear me clearly: neutrality is not sustainable. Kamea has chosen rebellion. If you choose to follow her, you\
  \ place yourself outside the law. I will treat you accordingly.</p>\
  <p>I want your talents aligned with the future. Not scattered across the battlefield as a cautionary tale. I offer \
  peace, purpose, and position. Refuse - and you will face force, swift and decisive.</p>\
  <p>My oath is unchanged:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>Stand down and you will not be harmed. But resist, and you will be fired \
  upon.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>I await your response, {22}.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.ESPINOSA_COUP.for={22},\
  <p>I''ve waited as long as I could, hoping we''d chart a course through this storm. But with every hour we stay \
  silent, the cracks in this unit grow deeper. You need to make a choice. And you need to make it now.</p>\
  <p>Lord Espinosa is not a tyrant. He is the architect of the Coalition''s infrastructure, the spine of our \
  stability, and the only adult in a room full of titles and dreams. He didn''t seize power for glory. He did it \
  because someone had to put their hand on the wheel before the Coalition drove itself into the sea.</p>\
  <p>And what does House Arano offer in return? A throne cloaked in tragedy and wrapped in fantasy. Kamea Arano \
  speaks of unity and restoration - but what she really dreams of is the Star League. She venerates a corpse. A \
  government that brutalized the Periphery for over a century. An empire that called our homes "backwaters" and \
  punished independence with orbital bombardments.</p>\
  <p>We are asked to shed blood for that vision? To defend a dynasty that wants to make the Reach a relic? No. I will\
  \ not die for nostalgia.</p>\
  <p>The Directorate offers us something real: command, resources, legitimacy. Santiago Espinosa treats us like \
  professionals. Like allies. Not pawns in some royal pageant staged for League loyalists and lost nobles.</p>\
  <p>And here''s what you need to hear, {22} - because too many are whispering it, and not enough are saying it \
  aloud:</p>\
  <p>This unit is already choosing sides. This ends in blood.</p>\
  <p>Make the call, {1}. I know you''re a good commander. Don''t let this unit die over a throne built on League \
  propaganda and aristocratic sentimentality.</p>

  <p>So please understand that when I say what I''m about to say, it is not out of disloyalty. It is out of conscience. \
  Out of duty - not to a flag or a chain of command - but to what''s <i>right</i>.</p>\
  <p><b>If you side with Santiago Espinosa, I will not follow you.</b></p>\
  <p>He is a tyrant. You''ve seen the broadcasts. But you haven''t seen the body piles being burned. You haven''t heard \
  the whispers coming about midnight round-ups. About prisoners disappearing in bulk. About mass graves - some with \
  Coalition seals still on the uniforms.</p>\
  <p>And if you doubt the rumors, just look at the timing. He didn''t wait months. He didn''t wait a year. He moved \
  <b>on the day of Kamea''s coronation</b> - just weeks after both her parents were killed in a JumpShip "accident" that\
  \ now feels anything but accidental.</p>\
  <p>This isn''t a transition. It''s a purge. This is what tyranny looks like when it still thinks it''s being subtle.</p>\
  <p>I know you''re hearing pressure from inside. I know others are already laying their pieces on the board. But this\
  \ is not a matter of politics, {1}. This is a moral line. And if you cross it - if you lead <b>{18}</b> into \

  <p>I will take control of this unit. I will not let our colors be used as cover for atrocities. I will not let our \

FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.ESPINOSA_COUP.newsFor=<h2 style="text-align:center">Another Day, Another Uprising: Aurigan \
  Turmoil Underscores Periphery Instability</h2>\
  <p>Civil unrest has once again ignited in the Periphery. This time, it''s the Aurigan Coalition that has plunged \
  into internal war. The would-be coronation of High Lady Kamea Arano was violently disrupted when her uncle, Lord \
  Santiago Espinosa, seized power and declared himself High Lord of a newly formed "Aurigan Directorate."</p>\
  <p>Local broadcasts described the event as a "stabilizing intervention." Critics in nearby systems are calling it \
  what it is: a coup.</p>\
  <p>Periphery politics have always been turbulent, but the speed and intensity of the Aurigan fracture have raised \
  new alarms. Less than a decade after the Coalition declared independence from both Canopian and Taurian pressure, \
  it now joins the long list of microstates too brittle to survive without collapsing inward.</p>\
  <p>In a show of early strength, the Directorate received immediate vocal support from several regional powers - \
  including a surprising endorsement from an elite regional command known as <b>{18}</b>, led by <b>{0}</b>.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We support High Lord Espinosa''s bid to preserve order in the Reach," {1} stated in a public \
  address. "The Coalition has no future if it tears itself apart chasing dead empires and fractured \
  crowns."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Also throwing its diplomatic weight behind the Directorate is the <b>Taurian Concordat</b>, whose Defense \
  Ministry released a carefully worded statement praising Espinosa''s "firm grasp of strategic realities" and pledging\
  \ economic assistance and border cooperation in the event of continued unrest.</p>\
  <p>But even with high-profile endorsements, the Directorate faces serious challenges. Reports from Panzyr, Guldra, \
  and Independence suggest that resistance loyal to House Arano is organizing, with smaller militias and rogue naval \
  units refusing to recognize Espinosa''s authority. Civilian casualties have already been reported in multiple \
  districts across the Coromodir system, with unverified rumors of political arrests and "containment camps" on \
  Weldry.</p>\
  <p>Observers have expressed concern that the Directorate''s foundation may be too reliant on force and fear to \
  endure.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"You can''t bomb your way into legitimacy," said Dr. Alton Reyes of the Federated Suns \
  Diplomatic Academy. "Espinosa may win the war, but he won''t build a nation on the rubble of \
  trust."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Critics have also questioned the wisdom of <b>{18}</b>'' involvement, with several retired AFFS generals \
  warning that the unit may be squandering its reputation by tying itself to an untested regime in a collapsing \
  border state.</p>\
  <p>The broader issue, however, is what this latest uprising says about the viability of Periphery microstates. The \
  Aurigan Coalition was meant to be a model - an alternative to Great House dominance, built on local alliances and \
  decentralized power. Instead, it now joins the long list of Periphery regions undone by noble infighting, economic \
  pressure, and unresolved trauma from centuries of Star League subjugation.</p>\
  <p>As one Lyran analyst quipped, "We should stop giving these places names and just number the collapses."</p>\
  <p>Still, with seasoned forces like <b>{18}</b> at its side, and Taurian influence giving it strategic depth, \
  the Directorate may yet hold. But whether it becomes a stable regime or just another footnote in Periphery history \
  books remains uncertain.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.ESPINOSA_COUP.newsAgainst=<h2 style="text-align:center">Arano Rises - But Can the Reach \
  Endure?</h2>\
  <p>The civil war in the Aurigan Reach has entered its next phase, and with it, yet another cautionary tale in the \
  fragility of Periphery microstates. This week, an elite house unit known as <b>{18}</b> officially declared \
  their loyalty to deposed ruler <b>Kamea Arano</b>, joining the growing resistance now formally organized as the \
  <i>Arano Restoration</i>.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"We fight not for a title, but for the soul of the Reach," said <b>{0}</b> in a public \
  broadcast. "High Lady Kamea Arano represents legitimate rule and the will of her people. We will not kneel to a \
  usurper."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The announcement electrified the Magistracy of Canopus, where Arano has long enjoyed popular and political \
  goodwill. Public rallies erupted in several Canopian cities, while Lady Ana Maria Centrella praised Arano''s \
  "unyielding devotion to her people" and condemned Lord Santiago Espinosa''s Directorate as a "coward''s throne, built\
  \ with treachery and fear."</p>\
  <p>In addition to securing the support of <b>{18}</b>, the Restoration has begun actively recruiting mercenary\
  \ commands to bolster its forces. These include contracts for planetary defense, recon, and targeted strikes \
  against Directorate logistical hubs. With most of the Coalition''s standing military under Directorate control, the \
  Restoration is building its war machine from scratch.</p>\
  <p>But this leads to a more troubling question: <b>how are they paying for it?</b> With trade routes fractured and \
  major noble houses embattled or in hiding, financial resources are limited. Some analysts believe Canopus is \
  providing covert funding. Others suspect sympathetic Aurigan nobles are liquidating planetary assets and stockpiles\
  \ to stay afloat - burning the seed corn to fight a war with no guaranteed harvest.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"It''s one thing to inspire loyalty," said Dr. Alton Reyes of the Federated Suns Diplomatic \
  Academy. "It''s another to meet a mercenary''s invoice when you''re governing from a stolen \
  DropShip."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The deeper problem isn''t just military - it''s structural. The Aurigan Coalition was always a tenuous experiment: a\
  \ patchwork of noble alliances, limited industry, and barely cohesive planetary cultures. The Directorate''s coup \
  may have lit the fuse, but the war itself is exposing deep fractures that were already present.</p>\
  <p>Even if Kamea Arano wins - if she retakes Coromodir, crushes Espinosa''s regime, and reclaims her throne - the \
  economic, political, and military cost may be fatal. Food production has dropped, key DropPorts have been bombed or\
  \ blockaded, and foreign trade has collapsed almost overnight.</p>\
  <p>Observers worry that victory for the Restoration may still lead to a slow collapse - not because of Espinosa, but \
  because of what the Reach was never strong enough to survive in the first place: time.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"Even if she wins," said Professor Elix Navarro of the Lyran Institute of Political Science, \
  "she inherits a state that''s already on fire and running out of water."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>'' decision to throw in with Arano reflects both moral conviction and strategic risk. It commits \
  them to a long and unpredictable campaign. If the Restoration falters - or if the promises of payment and postwar \
  authority prove empty - they may find themselves stranded in a failed state with no allies and no exit.</p>\
  <p>The Restoration is loud, fast, and idealistic. And in the Periphery, that''s often the prelude to collapse. Kamea\
  \ Arano may yet be the queen who reclaims her crown. But whether she can keep her kingdom from crumbling in her \
  hands is an entirely different battle - and it''s one that even victory on the battlefield might not win.</p>
# AMARIS COUP
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.AMARIS_COUP.initialOffer=<b>{0}</b>,\
  <p>I send this message with both solemn authority and respectful urgency. You are no doubt aware that the political\
  \ structure of the Star League has undergone significant transition. In this moment of transformation, the mantle \
  of leadership has passed to me - by necessity, by stability, and by the full cooperation of those who understood \
  what must be done.</p>\
  <p>As First Citizen of the Star League, I have assumed executive responsibility for safeguarding the institutions \
  and people of the League during this period of realignment. First Lord Richard Cameron remains under protective \
  custody, and all steps are being taken to ensure continuity of legacy and peace.</p>\
  <p>Your command, <b>{18}</b>, is recognized as a disciplined and capable unit. You have served the League with\
  \ distinction. I expect that same discipline will now guide you in service of the League''s evolving future.</p>\
  <p>I am offering you the opportunity to reaffirm your loyalty to the Star League under my stewardship. Your current\
  \ deployments will be honored, your command structure preserved, and your personnel rewarded for their continued \
  service. Those who stand with the future of the League will find their place secured in what comes next.</p>\
  <p>However, I must be clear: indecision at a moment like this is indistinguishable from dissent. The League has no \
  room for hesitation or fractured loyalties - not now. There are hostile actors poised to exploit confusion. I will \
  not permit it.</p>\
  <p>And I remind you: the Cameron family''s safety and visibility remain tightly controlled, for their own protection. \
  I alone ensure their security. Let no ambiguity exist about what that means.</p>\
  <p>I await the confirmation of your allegiance to the Star League, and to me. Delay, I will interpret silence as \
  abandonment - and act accordingly.</p>\
  <p>Choose wisely, {22}. The future of the League is being written now. Those who embrace it will endure. Those\
  \ who resist will be remembered only in the footnotes of failed rebellions.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.AMARIS_COUP.for={22},\
  <p>This is not a message I take pleasure in writing. But circumstances have changed - and so must our clarity.</p>\
  <p>As you''re no doubt aware, First Citizen Amaris has extended his hand to <b>{18}</b> and to all loyal \
  officers of the Star League. While official channels grind through their rituals, others have already begun \
  adjusting to the realities of leadership under the new administration.</p>\
  <p>I was approached directly. I won''t insult you with vague denials. I''ve listened, I''ve spoken, and I''ve \
  considered carefully. And I''ve come to a conclusion - as have others:</p>\
  <p><b>We will be swearing allegiance to First Citizen Amaris. Soon. With or without your blessing.</b></p>\
  <p>{22}, I have always respected your professionalism. You are measured, deliberate, and just. But this is not\
  \ a time for deliberation. It is a time for alignment.</p>\
  <p>We would greatly prefer not to divide <b>{18}</b>. We would prefer not to take action at all. But if \
  you choose to defy the new order... I will not be held responsible for what we are required to do.</p\
  <p>We have no interest in turning this unit into a battlefield. But make no mistake: we will not follow anyone into\
  \ treason. I urge you - truly - to stand with us. Make your declaration in favor of Amaris, and we will continue \
  forward as one command, whole and unshaken.</p>\
  <p>The alternative would be regrettable. And final.</p>\
  <p>You have until local dusk tomorrow.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.AMARIS_COUP.against={22},\
  <p>Something is wrong. Everyone feels it. No matter what First Citizen Amaris claims, this isn''t continuity. It''s \
  control. It''s consolidation. It''s a coup.</p>\
  <p>He says First Lord Cameron is "under protection." He says it''s all temporary. Then why the lockdowns? Why the \
  censorship? Why the sealed channels and vanishing aides? You know as well as I do: when governments stop \
  explaining, it''s because they''ve done something they can''t justify.</p>\
  <p>I don''t know where Richard Cameron is - but I know he''s not leading anything. And I know Stefan Amaris is not \
  my First Lord.</p>\
  <p>{22}, <b>{18}</b> are already splitting. You see it too. Some have answered Amaris''s calls. Some have\
  \ accepted his gifts. Some have started whispering about "the future" like it''s already been decided. I tell you \
  now: I will not follow them. I will not serve a usurper in a stolen uniform.</p>\
  <p>The Star League still exists - not in titles, but in principles. In the oath we swore. And that oath was to the \
  League, not to the loudest voice in the room. General Kerensky hasn''t folded. He''s rallying loyal forces in the \
  Periphery. We should go to him. We should fight for the League.</p>\
  <p>If you believe in our oath, {22} - if you remember why you put this uniform on in the first place - then \
  lead us there. Don''t let this unit rot under someone else''s shadow. Don''t let history turn our silence into \
  approval.</p>\
  <p>And if you choose otherwise, if you raise Amaris''s banner over our camp, then you will force my hand. I will \
  not serve him. I will not obey. And I will not stand down.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.AMARIS_COUP.newsFor=<h2 style="text-align:center">Stability Secured: Units Reaffirm Loyalty to \
  the League</h2>\
  <p>In a decisive show of confidence and responsibility, numerous military and civilian commands across the Star \
  League have formally reaffirmed their oaths of loyalty to the League''s guiding authority under First Citizen \
  Stefan Amaris. <b>{18}</b>, a prominent formation headquartered in the Terran Hegemony, have issued a public \
  declaration of continued service to the League and its protector.</p>\
  <p>This swift affirmation signals that the majority of Star League Defense Force and attached auxiliary units \
  recognize the necessity of strong, unified leadership during a time of administrative restructuring.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"Our loyalty is to the League. That loyalty has not wavered," said <b>{0}</b> of \
  <b>{18}</b>. "We are proud to serve the Star League and to carry out the duties entrusted to us by its \
  rightful government."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>To ensure peace, stability, and open dialogue across all League territories, peacekeeping detachments from the \
  Rim Worlds Republic have been dispatched to key administrative and civilian hubs. These trained personnel, \
  operating in partnership with local SLDF garrisons, will assist in the transition process and maintain calm in \
  areas where misinformation may threaten public order.</p>\
  <p>The First Citizen''s Office encourages all concerned citizens to speak freely and share their observations with \
  local peacekeeping forces, who are available around the clock to answer questions, provide reassurance, and respond\
  \ to any disruptive behavior with appropriate professionalism.</p>\
  <p>Reports of unrest are minimal, isolated, and largely attributed to a lack of accurate information. Steps are \
  being taken to streamline communications across all systems and to remove false or contradictory broadcasts that may \
  provoke confusion or fear.</p>\
  <p>Rim Worlds Republic forces are already active in multiple districts on Terra, New Earth, Keid, and other League \
  member-worlds, with deployments expanding to house-border systems in coordination with planetary governors.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"Peace and unity are not imposed - they are preserved," said First Citizen Stefan Amaris in a \
  brief address. "The League remains whole. The people remain safe. And our duty remains unchanged."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>With most League departments continuing their work uninterrupted, and with increasing numbers of SLDF officers \
  reaffirming their commitment to the new administration, the path forward is clear. What was once uncertain is now \
  stabilized. What was threatened is now secure.</p>\
  <p>The League endures - and with it, the promise of order, prosperity, and peace.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.AMARIS_COUP.newsAgainst=<h2 style="text-align:center">Disloyal Elements Break from League \
  Unity</h2>\
  <p>A small but disruptive group of Star League Defense Force elements have formally severed their allegiance to the\
  \ League and aligned themselves with General Aleksandr Kerensky in what authorities are now officially classifying \
  as a mutinous separatist movement.</p>\
  <p>The movement - centered in the Periphery and operating under the unauthorized banner of "restoration" - includes\
  \ a handful of rogue SLDF units, among them formerly respected commands such as <b>{18}</b>. This group has \
  publicly refused First Citizen Amaris''s lawful leadership and declared support for Kerensky''s unconstitutional \
  seizure of operational authority beyond his legal jurisdiction.</p>\
  <p>General Kerensky, formerly Commanding General of the SLDF, has misused his position and influence to foment \
  rebellion from outside the League''s core territories. Rather than participate in the lawful reorganization of \
  central authority following administrative restructuring, Kerensky has chosen the path of unilateral militarism and\
  \ veiled ambition.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"This is not patriotism - it is opportunism," said League Justice Administrator Mako Tormund. \
  "General Kerensky is no longer a servant of peace. He is a warlord in search of a crown."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Sources within the Department of Information Coordination report that Kerensky has been meeting in secret with \
  Periphery separatists, local nobles, and dissident elements of the SLDF to build a splinter command structure loyal\
  \ to his person - not the League. This movement is viewed as a direct challenge to the unity, stability, and \
  continuity of League law.</p>\
  <p>Of particular concern is <b>{18}</b>'' involvement. Once regarded as a professional and apolitical force, \
  <b>{18}</b> have allowed personal ideologies and misplaced loyalties to override their sworn obligations. \
  Their recent declaration in favor of Kerensky - delivered without diplomatic consultation or command coordination -\
  \ amounts to an open declaration of rebellion.</p>\
  <p>While the First Citizen''s Office continues to advocate for reconciliation and restoration of duty, authorities \
  are clear that armed insubordination will not be tolerated.</p>\
  <p>In response to these developments, Rim Worlds Republic peacekeeping forces have been reinforced across the \
  Hegemony and key League systems to protect infrastructure, support civilian calm, and suppress emerging unrest. \
  Citizens are reminded that collaboration with mutinous forces is a criminal offense under the Star League Charter.</p>\
  <p>Persons with concerns or information related to disloyal elements are encouraged to speak with local \
  peacekeeping coordinators. Confidentiality and gratitude are guaranteed.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"The League is not under threat from within - it is under siege from a disloyal man who \
  mistakes personal ambition for righteous cause," said Director Urel Vann of Strategic \
  Communication.</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>First Citizen Amaris remains committed to preserving the Star League as the greatest political achievement in \
  human history. The majority of League worlds, armed forces, and citizens continue to uphold that vision with honor \
  and resolve. The actions of a few misguided officers will not alter the future of billions.</p>\
  <p>The Star League endures. The people endure. And order will be restored.</p>

FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.EXODUS.initialOffer={0},\
  <p>You''ve bled for the League. You''ve stood when others folded. When Amaris defiled Terra, you helped take it \
  back. I haven''t forgotten.</p>\
  <p>That''s why I''m writing to you directly. Not as a general to a subordinate - but as one soldier to another.</p>\
  <p>You and I both know the war didn''t end when we dragged Amaris out of the palace. The real rot was waiting \
  behind him. The Great Houses are circling like carrion, tearing the League apart piece by piece while they mouth \
  oaths they''ve already broken. They never wanted to preserve the League. They want to own its corpse.</p>\
  <p>I''ve spent my life fighting for the Star League. You have too. But there is no Star League left - not in this \
  place. Not in this generation.</p>\
  <p>So I''ve made the hardest decision of my life. I''m taking those still loyal - those who remember what we stood \
  for - and I''m leaving. We''re going beyond the Periphery, far beyond. We will build something new, something clean.\
  \ A place where the dream doesn''t have to die under another throne.</p>\
  <p>This is not retreat. This is preservation. Of purpose. Of honor. Of unity. You understand what that means, I \
  know you do. Because you''ve fought not just to win - but to serve.</p>\
  <p>Commander, I want <b>{18}</b> with me. You''ve earned that right. And I won''t lie to you: this won''t be \
  easy. It''s exile. It''s risk. But it''s the only path forward where we don''t have to become what we just finished\
  \ fighting.</p>\
  <p>If you come, you''ll be given a place of distinction. Not out of favor - but out of trust. I know you''ll lead \
  well. I know your people believe in something more than contracts and banners. This is for them too.</p>\
  <p>Time is short. The ships are loading. I will leave coordinates and clearance codes encrypted in this message. \
  Use them. Or don''t. But choose quickly. Once we''re gone, we''re gone for good.</p>\
  <p>Whatever you decide, know this: I''ve never forgotten those who stood their ground when the rest of the galaxy \
  collapsed. You were one of them. That will always matter.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.EXODUS.for={22},\
  <p>You''ve given me orders I didn''t always understand, but I followed them because I believed in you - and I \
  believed in what we were defending. I still do. That''s why I''m writing now. Not as your deputy. Not as your \
  subordinate. As someone who''s marched beside you through fire, and now sees the next fire coming.</p>\
  <p>We can''t stay here, {22}. Not after what we''ve seen. Not after what we know is coming.</p>\
  <p>The Great Houses don''t want to rebuild the Star League. They want its bones. They want the power of the SLDF - \
  its ''Meks, its WarShips, its people - to use against one another until there''s nothing left but ruins flying flags. \
  They''ll fight over Terra like dogs over a carcass. And they''ll drag us into it. Again and again. Until we''re all\
  \ ash.</p>\
  <p>You know it''s true. We both do. You''ve seen the greed in their eyes. You''ve seen how fast unity broke down \
  the moment we finished the war. It''ll be succession war after succession war, each more bitter, more wasteful, \
  more meaningless than the last. It won''t end. Not in our lifetime. Maybe not ever.</p>\
  <p>The only way to stop it is to leave. To take the fire out of their hands. If <b>{18}</b> go with Kerensky -\
  \ if the SLDF vanishes beyond their reach - we deny them the very tools they need to burn the Inner Sphere to the \
  ground.</p>\
  <p>Exile isn''t surrender. It''s salvation. For us. For our people. For the idea of the League, even if it has to \
  sleep for a while in the dark.</p>\
  <p>I know what you''re weighing. Loyalty. Duty. Legacy. But I''m asking you - don''t weigh them against a future \
  that''s already broken. We gave everything to hold the League together. If we stay, all that sacrifice will be used\
  \ to tear it apart.</p>\
  <p>Let''s leave. Not because we''re running. But because staying would make us into something we fought to stop.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.EXODUS.against={22},\
  <p>I know the voices around you are pulling in different directions - go with Kerensky, run from the Houses, \
  disappear into the void. But I believe there''s a third option. A quieter one. One with less glory, and maybe more \
  meaning.</p>\
  <p>We can stay. Not with the Houses. Not with their thrones and banners and endless wars. But with <b>Jerome \
  Blake</b>  - and the dream he''s quietly keeping alive.</p>\
  <p>Blake stood beside us during the war. When we fought to take Terra back from Amaris, he was there. Not in the \
  cockpit of a BattleMek, no - but in the trenches of communications, strategy, coordination. He helped us hold the \
  HPG net together when everything else was falling apart. And now, when others are fighting over power, Blake is \
  focused on preserving something that actually matters: the very infrastructure of civilization.</p>\
  <p>He''s not interested in ruling. He''s interested in protecting what we still have - knowledge, connection, \
  stability. The HPG network is the spine of the Inner Sphere. If that collapses, everything collapses. He knows that. \
  And he has a plan to protect it - not for profit, not for conquest, but for the future.</p>\
  <p>Kerensky is right about the Houses - but he''s wrong about the only solution. We don''t have to flee to preserve\
  \ the League. We can anchor it. On Terra. Beside those who remember what it stood for, and who are still trying to \
  hold onto that truth without raising a sword.</p>\
  <p>Let the Houses fight. Let them chase crowns. We''ll stand with Blake. We''ll preserve the libraries, the comms, \
  the science, the memory. We''ll be what the League once was: a foundation. A quiet one, maybe. But enduring.</p>\
  <p>If we leave, we take our strength with us and abandon the Sphere to ruin. But if we stay - and stand with those \
  few still trying to build - we can be something more. Not conquerors. Not exiles. Guardians.</p>\
  <p>You taught us not just how to fight, {22} - but why. I believe this is a fight worth staying for.</p>
FactionStandingUltimatumDialog.EXODUS.newsFor=<h2 style="text-align:center">Kerensky''s Exodus: Star League Armies\
  \ Vanish from the Sphere</h2>\
  <p>In an astonishing turn, General Aleksandr Kerensky has led a massive armada of Star League Defense Force ships \
  out of the Inner Sphere. Estimates place the fleet at roughly <b>1,349 JumpShips, 402 WarShips, and over 5,000 \
  DropShips</b> carrying an estimated six million SLDF personnel, including soldiers, civilians, and families.</p>\
  <p>Among those reported to have departed with Kerensky are <b>{18}</b>, a semi-independent SLDF unit long \
  praised for its discipline and adaptability. Their departure signals a deeper fracture within the already unstable \
  Star League command structure.</p>\
  <p>Kerensky''s destination - and ultimate purpose - remain shrouded in secrecy. The armada slipped beyond Periphery\
  \ systems with minimal communication. League officials emphasize that this operation is "a controlled departure of \
  trusted forces to preserve command integrity." However, critics warn that the loss of such a vast SLDF contingent \
  leaves a dangerous vacuum.</p>\
  <p>"With their finest troops and ships gone, who stands for the Star League now?" asked political analyst Delyana \
  Cortez. "The Great Houses have no intention of preserving what Kerensky once fought to save. We might be witnessing\
  \ the final unraveling of centralized authority."</p>\
  <p>The sudden exodus raises urgent questions: Who will stand as First Lord of the Star League? With Kerensky absent\
  \ and the Cameron line extinct, no consensus candidate has emerged. Great Houses have yet to propose a replacement,\
  \ and rumors of clandestine power grabs intensify by the hour.</p>\
  <p>Civilian populations across the Sphere are already feeling the impact. Defense ministries are scrambling to \
  shore up planetary security, while League-aligned worlds are at risk of falling under House control - or worse, \
  descending into local succession wars.</p>\
  <p>Merchants warn of disrupted trade in junctions previously protected by SLDF escorts. Analysts say the exodus \
  might catalyze a full-scale collapse into conflict as factions vie for SLDF remnants or expend House military \
  assets.</p>\
  <p>Yet supporters of Kerensky''s move argue it may be a drastic but necessary step to preserve military cohesion \
  and avoid turning the remaining SLDF into instruments of House politics.</p>\
  <p>Kerensky''s departure represents one of the most dramatic events in decades - possibly centuries. If the fleet \
  finds a safe haven and consolidates, the Star League could rise again under a new banner. But if the Armada \
  vanishes or splinters, the Inner Sphere may enter an era of prolonged chaos.</p>\

  their command was brief: "We remain committed to the ideals of the Star League, and to preserving what remains."</p>\
  <p>Observers are scrambling to understand the reasoning behind the decision. With the Star League''s military \
  backbone now gone, many had assumed <b>{18}</b> would follow Kerensky out of loyalty and survival instinct. \
  Their choice to stay has caught many off guard.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"Either they know something we don''t," said analyst Tamas Verne of Lyran Strategic Institute,\
  \ "or they''ve found a new purpose that roots them to Terra."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Rumors circulating among diplomatic and communications channels suggest that <b>{18}</b>'' decision may be \
  connected to recent moves by <b>Jerome Blake</b>>, current acting administrator of the Star League Communications \
  Network (SLCOMNET). Blake has reportedly begun efforts to stabilize the interstellar HPG network, positioning it as\
  \ the backbone of whatever remains of the League''s infrastructure.</p>\
  <p>While no direct confirmation has been made, sources close to the network''s Terra-based offices say that several\
  \ SLDF liaison officers and intelligence units have been seconded to Blake''s administration in recent weeks. It''s\
  \ possible <b>{18}</b> see their future not in war or exile - but in preservation.</p>\
  <p>With no successor to the First Lord and the military arm of the League gone, Terra is now a symbol of a legacy \
  fading into uncertainty. The Great Houses, though publicly restrained, are already making quiet moves to fill the \
  vacuum.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b>'' refusal to leave may mark the beginning of a new power dynamic - one rooted not in conquest, \
  but in communications, neutrality, and long-term continuity.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><i><p>"They stayed behind when it was safest to leave," said historian Amari Dawe. "Which means they\
  \ believe something here is still worth protecting."</i></p></blockquote>\
  <p>Whether that something is Jerome Blake, the HPG network, or the last flicker of the Star League''s light - only \
  time will tell.</p>
