messageChallengeUnknown.text=Intelligence reports indicate the enemy force is currently unknown. Sensor\
  \ data from the Area of Operations is limited, and we are unable to confirm the size, composition,\
  \ or strength of the opposing forces at this time.\
  <br>\
  <br>Despite the uncertainty, we trust in your proven ability to adapt and overcome in dynamic conditions.\
  \ The success of this mission could offer significant strategic advantages and may yield considerable\
  \ rewards upon completion.\
  <br>\
  <br><i>If you accept this mission, prepare your unit for all potential scenarios. Expect the unexpected.\
  \ Alternatively, you may withdraw and await further opportunities.</i>
messageChallengeVeryEasy.text=Our intel indicates that the enemy forces in this mission are well below\
  \ your unit's capabilities. To be frank, this operation appears to be beneath a commander of your\
  \ experience and firepower. We're surprised you've chosen to pursue such a low-priority target,\
  \ given your past accomplishments.\
  <br>\
  <br>That said, you're free to proceed if you see value in this mission - whether for training purposes\
  \ or other reasons. We trust your judgment, though this engagement likely offers minimal challenge or reward.\
  <br>\
  <br><i>If you intend to deploy, confirm your orders.\
  <br>Otherwise, you may return to review more fitting opportunities.</i>
messageChallengeEasy.text=We have reviewed the details of the mission you're considering. Intel suggests\
  \ that the enemy forces in the AO are considerably inferior to your current unit's capabilities.\
  \ Frankly, we're uncertain why you'd allocate such substantial resources to what appears to be a\
  \ low-risk engagement.\
  <br>\
  <br>While the mission should pose no serious threat, we trust you have your reasons for pursuing\
  \ this objective. Perhaps you're looking to sharpen your team's skills, or there's something here\
  \ we've overlooked. Regardless, you can expect minimal resistance, and mission success is all but\
  \ guaranteed.\
  <br>\
  <br><i>If you wish to proceed with this operation, confirm your deployment.\
  <br>Otherwise, you may choose to reserve your forces for more suitable engagements.</i>
messageChallengeHard.text=Our analysis of the upcoming mission indicates that the enemy forces will\
  \ present a formidable challenge. They are well-armed, well-coordinated, and capable of inflicting\
  \ significant damage. While we believe your unit has the skill and firepower to succeed, you should\
  \ be prepared for a tough fight and the possibility of sustaining losses.\
  <br>\
  <br>This mission will test your tactical abilities and resourcefulness. Victory is achievable, but\
  \ it won't come without cost. We trust in your leadership to make the right call.\
  <br>\
  <br><i>If you are ready to face this challenge, confirm your deployment.\
  <br>Otherwise, you may return to assess alternative missions.</i>
messageChallengeVeryHard.text=We've reviewed the mission details, and it's our duty to inform you that\
  \ the enemy force is well beyond your unit's current strength. Intelligence reports indicate overwhelming\
  \ opposition - superior in numbers, firepower, and tactical advantage. Based on the available data,\
  \ victory in this engagement seems highly improbable.\
  <br>\
  <br>Given the extreme risk and near-certain loss, we have serious doubts about the likelihood of success.\
  \ While we respect your resolve, we strongly urge you to reconsider. Engaging these forces could\
  \ result in devastating losses for you and your unit.\
  <br>\
  <br><i>If you are committed to this course of action, confirm your deployment.\
  <br>Otherwise, you may return to review more suitable assignments.</i>
messageChallengeGarrison.text=You have selected a garrison assignment. As part of this contract,\
  \ your unit will be responsible for maintaining a defensive presence in your assigned Sectors.\
  \ However, we cannot predict when - or even if - you will be called to fight. Furthermore, we\
  \ have no reliable intelligence on potential adversaries or the scale of any engagement that may\
  \ arise.\
  <br\
  ><br>The provided data is for estimation purposes only. Situational developments may occur\
  \ without warning, and you should be prepared for anything - from prolonged quiet to sudden,\
  \ large-scale conflict. Flexibility and readiness will be essential for the success of this\
  \ contract.\
  <br>\
  <br><i>If you are prepared to assume this role, confirm your deployment.\
  <br>Otherwise, you may return to review other opportunities.</i>
