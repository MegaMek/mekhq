mothballDescription.text={0}, our employer has offered to assist our personnel in getting our\
  \ equipment ready for transport.\
  <p>Prior to loading, all equipment in our TO&E will be <b>mothballed</b>. This will prevent us\
  \ needing to maintain it while in transit, and the units will be <b>unmothballed</b> prior to\
  \ arrival. Equipment outside our TO&E will be unaffected.</p>\
  <p>Will we be accepting their offer?</p>\
  <p>If we decline, you will still be able to manually order mothballing of equipment, but this\
  \ will need to be arranged by right-clicking the unit in the Hangar panel of your command console,\
  \ and selecting 'mothball.' Our techs will then take care of it as time becomes available.</p>
mothballDescription.addendum=Mothballing your equipment will temporarily remove it from your TO&E and may increase your\
  \ transport fees. Your employer will not reimburse you for these additional fees.\
  <p>The benefit of mothballing your units is that you will not be required to maintain them. This ensures that your units\
  \ will always arrive in fighting condition.</p>
transitDescription.text=Our target system is <b>{0}</b>. {1} has already calculated the best route\
  \ for us.\
  <br>\
  <br>This journey will take us approximately <b>{2}</b> days and cost <b>{3} C-Bills</b>. Would you like to\
  \ accept this route and begin transit?\
  <br>\
  <br>If we decline, you will need to manually order route calculation from the Interstellar Map.\
  \ This can be done by selecting the target system in your Briefing Room, followed by 'Calculate\
  \ Jump Path' and 'Begin Transit.'
