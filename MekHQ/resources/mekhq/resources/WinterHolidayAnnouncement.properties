#### Paragraph 0
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.0.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, I wanted to update you on the unit''s plans for the upcoming\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>.\
  <p>My team has put together some ideas to honor the tradition while accommodating our current schedule.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.1.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Hey {0}, just wanted to give you a heads-up about the unit''s\
  \ plans for the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>.\
  <p>My team''s come up with some fun ideas to honor the tradition while keeping it low-key enough to fit around our\
  \ duties.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.2.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, I wanted to inform you of the unit''s plans for the upcoming\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.3.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Brace yourself, {0}, the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is coming up, and the unit is ready to blow off some steam!\
  <p>We''ve got plans in place to make it fun while keeping things organized.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.4.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, I just wanted to update you on the plans for the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>.\
  <p>The unit is really looking forward to it, and we''re putting together a few activities to keep spirits high over the\
  \ holidays.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.5.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, just a quick update on the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holiday</a>.\
  <p>You know how it goes - the holidays are upon us, and we''ve got the usual plans lined up to keep morale from\
  \ plummeting into the abyss.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.6.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, with the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ coming up, the unit''s eager to take part.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.7.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Just giving you the heads-up -\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is approaching, and the unit is gearing up to celebrate.\
  <p>I think they''re mostly in it for the excuse to light stuff on fire and have a mock brawl. You know how it goes.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.8.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=So, {0}, we''re doing the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter\
  \ Holiday</a> thing again.\
  <p>The unit has decided that the best way to honor tradition is by lighting large fires and pretending to beat each\
  \ other up. It''s basically morale-boosting through minor chaos.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.9.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ coming up, the unit is looking forward to taking part in something that lifts the spirit. After a tough stretch, I\
  \ think  everyone''s eager for a bit of tradition and camaraderie.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.10.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ just around the corner, and the unit couldn''t be more pumped. We''re pulling together some great activities to honor\
  \ the tradition while keeping the atmosphere upbeat.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.11.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Just giving you the rundown -\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is upon us, and the unit has decided it''s the perfect excuse\
  \ to get creative (and maybe a little chaotic).
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.12.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=So, we''re gearing up for the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>, and I''m trying to keep up with the sheer enthusiasm here. The\
  \ unit is putting way more effort into this than I expected.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.13.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ approaching, the unit is really looking forward to taking a break and celebrating. We''ve put together a few activities\
  \ that honor the tradition while keeping morale high.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.14.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Just wanted to keep you in the loop -\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> kicks off on December 17th, and the unit is ready to go all out.\
  \ I''m trying to keep things under control, but enthusiasm levels are off the charts.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.15.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, the unit is buzzing with excitement for the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>. We''ve put together some fun activities to celebrate the season\
  \ and lift everyone''s spirits.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.16.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Looks like we''re in for another round of\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> madness.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.17.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=We''ve established the unit''s plans for the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>. The focus will be on maintaining morale while minimizing\
  \ operational disruptions.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.18.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The unit''s looking forward to the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.19.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Brace yourself, {0}, <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter\
  \ Holiday</a> is almost here, and the unit is hyped.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.20.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=So, the unit is gearing up for the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>, and I guess I''m in charge of making sure it doesn''t turn into\
  \ an all-out brawl.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.21.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Just a quick note, {0}, <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter\
  \ Holiday</a> is coming up, and the unit''s already brainstorming how to make it memorable.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.22.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ on the horizon, the unit''s really looking forward to taking a break from the routine. We''re planning some activities\
  \ to keep morale up and make the celebration meaningful.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.23.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Looks like we''re doing the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> again.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.24.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Well, it''s that time of year -\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is back, and the unit''s already in full planning mode. Apparently,\
  \ the fifth night bonfire is the "can''t-miss" event.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.25.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The unit is gearing up for the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>, and I have to say, it''s nice to see a bit of excitement for\
  \ something that''s not work-related.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.26.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ approaching, and the unit''s already getting overzealous.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.27.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ coming up, and the unit''s already putting plans in motion.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.28.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=So, <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ back, and I think the unit is using it as an excuse to get a little wild.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.29.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ coming up, and the unit is already plotting how to make it bigger than last year.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.30.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Hey {0}, the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ are almost upon us once more. And you know what that means? That''s right: barely contained chaos.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.31.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ approaching, the unit is really coming together to plan something special.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.32.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=<a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is coming\
  \ up, and the unit''s already on it.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.33.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ almost here, and the unit is coming together to make it meaningful.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.34.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ approaching, I''ve noticed a shift in the unit''s attitude. People are slowing down a bit, taking stock of what this\
  \ time of year means to them.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.35.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Guess what, {0}? The unit has decided that the best way to\
  \ deal with everything is to dive headfirst into <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>. Because nothing\
  \ says "efficient military operation" like bonfires and mock duels.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.36.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ coming up, the unit has been talking about how much it means to keep some traditions alive, even out here. There''s a\
  \ sense of nostalgia in the air, and I think people are really looking forward to connecting with one another.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.37.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The unit is really looking forward to this year''s\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>. It''s nice to see everyone putting effort into making it special.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.38.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, I just wanted to let you know that the unit is really\
  \ stepping up to make the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> something special this year.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.39.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Well, it''s official - the unit has decided that the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is exactly what we need to stay sane. I guess nothing says "unit\
  \ cohesion" like burning stuff and pretending to fight.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.40.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=With the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a>\
  \ coming up, the unit is eager for a break from routine. It''s been a challenging few months, and people are looking\
  \ forward to taking a step back, even just for a few nights.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.41.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ almost here, and I have to admit, the unit''s enthusiasm is both uplifting and a bit exhausting. They''re really trying\
  \ to make it something memorable this year, which I suppose we could all use.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.42.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Well, it''s official - <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter\
  \ Holiday</a> is happening whether we''re ready or not.\
  <p>The unit''s excitement is borderline contagious.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.43.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=As we prepare for the <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter\
  \ Holiday</a>, the unit has shown remarkable resilience. They''re putting together activities to not just celebrate,\
  \ but also reconnect and support one another.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.44.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=Just letting you know, the unit has embraced the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> with their usual lack of subtlety.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.45.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ fast approaching, and the unit is really looking forward to it. After everything we''ve been through, it''s nice to\
  \ see people focusing on something positive.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.46.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ upon us, and the unit is treating it like a strategic operation.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.47.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=The <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is\
  \ on everyone''s mind, and it''s giving the unit something to look forward to.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.48.planetside.paragraph.0.ic=I''m not sure how it happened, but the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> has become a full-scale production.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.49.planetside.paragraph.0.ic={0}, I thought you should know that the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> is now officially the most important thing in the unit''s lives.
#### Paragraph 2
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.0.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The unit is particularly enthusiastic about the fifth night\
  \ bonfire. We''re setting up a safe area for it, and after the fire burns out, two volunteers will act out the symbolic\
  \ fight. I''ve put out some feelers to see who fancies a good scrap and my team will handle the betting pool.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.1.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The highlight for most seems to be the fifth night bonfire.\
  \ We''re setting up a safe spot for it, and after the fire burns out, two volunteers will act out the symbolic fight.\
  \ I''m already hearing some competitive banter about who''ll take the stage, and there''s talk of setting up a friendly\
  \ betting pool.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.2.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>One significant event is the fifth night bonfire. We will\
  \ ensure a secure area for the fire, and after it burns out, two volunteers will participate in the symbolic fight.\
  \ There is notable enthusiasm for this, and we are coordinating participants.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.3.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire seems to be the biggest draw. After\
  \ the fire dies down, two brave souls will step into the circle for the symbolic "battle of life and death." I''m already\
  \ hearing some smack talk and a few side bets forming. We''re making sure it stays friendly... mostly.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.4.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire has everyone buzzing. We''ll have a\
  \ safe setup for the fire, and after it burns down, two volunteers will stage the symbolic fight. I''m hearing a lot of\
  \ friendly rivalry already, and it''s shaping up to be a fun evening.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.5.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is the hot topic. After the fire\
  \ dies down, we''ll have two "volunteers" step up for the traditional symbolic fight. I''m sure no one''s going to take\
  \ that way too seriously or anything. Betting pools are already forming - because of course they are.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.6.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is the one everyone''s looking\
  \ forward to. After the fire burns out, we''ll have a symbolic fight between two volunteers. There''s already a bit of\
  \ competitive spirit brewing, but we''ll keep it friendly.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.7.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is looking like the main attraction.\
  \ After the flames die down, we''ll have two "willing" volunteers act out the traditional symbolic fight. I''m\
  \ half-expecting some theatrical overacting - apparently, people are already practicing their "death throes." We''re\
  \ also planning a simple meal around the fire, as long as nobody accidentally cooks themselves.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.8.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is the one they''re hyped about.\
  \ We''ll have a firepit set up, and once it dies down, two "gladiators" will step in to perform the traditional symbolic\
  \ fight. I''m guessing it''ll be half-theater, half-comedic wrestling, and entirely something I''ll have Security\
  \ monitor.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.9.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is one of the most anticipated\
  \ events. After the flames die down, we''ll have two volunteers act out the symbolic fight. There''s a lot of friendly\
  \ competition for who gets to participate, so we''ll make sure it''s safe and lighthearted.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.10.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is already creating some buzz.\
  \ After the fire burns out, we''ll have the symbolic fight, and let''s just say there''s no shortage of volunteers ready\
  \ to put on a dramatic (and hopefully safe) show. People are talking about "costume enhancements" to make it more\
  \ epic.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.11.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is turning into quite a spectacle.\
  \ After the fire burns out, two brave souls will stage a symbolic fight. I''m not sure whether to be impressed or\
  \ worried, considering some of the "combat techniques" I''ve heard discussed.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.12.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is officially a big deal. There''s\
  \ talk of incorporating choreography into the symbolic fight. I''m not sure who started that idea, but I''m getting\
  \ flashbacks to interpretive dance night. I''ve already seen one homemade costume, and it''s... creative.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.13.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire has generated a lot of positive\
  \ energy. After the fire burns down, we''ll have the traditional symbolic fight. There''s a lot of good-natured rivalry\
  \ brewing among the volunteers. I''m confident it''ll be a spirited, safe event.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.14.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is shaping up to be... interesting.\
  \ After the fire goes out, two brave (or slightly drunk) volunteers will act out the symbolic fight. They''ve asked if\
  \ they can use "props" to make it more realistic. I''m trying to convince them that steel folding chairs are not\
  \ ''props.''</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.15.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is already a hit before it even\
  \ starts. After the fire dies down, we''ll have the symbolic fight, and everyone''s taking it seriously (maybe a little\
  \ too seriously). I''ve had multiple people practicing "heroic battle cries."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.16.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The unit''s fired up (literally) about the fifth night\
  \ bonfire. They''re already arguing over who gets to stage the traditional fight. I swear one guy is practicing dramatic\
  \ death poses.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.17.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will include the traditional\
  \ symbolic fight. We''ve arranged safety protocols and designated an area for the event. Participation is voluntary,\
  \ but interest is high.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.18.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is drawing a lot of interest. The\
  \ symbolic fight afterward has sparked some good-natured rivalry, and we''re planning to make it a safe, spirited\
  \ event.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.19.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is turning into a "who can be the\
  \ most dramatic combatant" competition. I''m pretty sure someone''s rehearsing a monologue about "The Tragedy of PT\
  \ Tuesdays."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.20.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=S<p>They''re a bit too enthusiastic about the fifth night\
  \ bonfire and the traditional fight. I''m keeping an eye on the more competitive types - nobody needs a sprained ankle\
  \ over "symbolic conflict."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.21.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is shaping up to be a hit, with\
  \ some folks planning to add a bit of storytelling flair to the symbolic fight. I''ve heard rumors of costumes - no\
  \ promises on historical accuracy. Apparently someone''s managed to source an old Hegemony officer''s uniform... from\
  \ <i>somewhere</i>. No, I have no idea either.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.22.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is getting a lot of attention -\
  \ everyone''s eager to see who steps up for the symbolic fight. I''m pretty sure there''s some light-hearted training\
  \ going on.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.23.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The unit is getting real excited over the fifth night\
  \ bonfire. They''re already bickering over who gets to stage the symbolic fight. I''m trying to keep it civilized, but\
  \ enthusiasm levels are off the charts.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.24.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>I overheard someone saying they''re planning to "really\
  \ commit" to the symbolic fight this year. I think they might be rehearsing.</p>\
  <p>And yes, someone''s taken it upon themselves to make sure we don''t run out of marshmallows. Priorities, I guess.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.25.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is sparking some friendly rivalry\
  \ over who will take part in the symbolic fight. I''m just hoping it doesn''t get too spirited.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.26.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>They''re planning the fifth night bonfire, and someone\
  \ suggested adding pyrotechnics to the symbolic fight. I am shutting that down before it becomes another "safety\
  \ demonstration."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.27.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is drawing a lot of interest -\
  \ particularly the symbolic fight. They''ve set up a sign-up sheet, and it''s filling up fast. I have to admit, it''s\
  \ nice to see everyone this engaged.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.28.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is already being hyped as "the\
  \ event of the year." I caught two of the techs practicing "dramatic combat rolls" for the symbolic fight.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.29.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is getting a lot of hype, and I''m\
  \ bracing for at least one over-enthusiastic display during the symbolic fight.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.30.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>It''s the fifth night bonfire that everyone is really\
  \ excited for. I think it''s the symbolic fight folks are really looking forward to. Rumor has it one of your techs has\
  \ built a pair of swords and shields out of scraps we had lying about. I''m just praying nobody loses an eye.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.31.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is drawing a lot of positive\
  \ attention, and volunteers for the symbolic fight are signing up with enthusiasm.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.32.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is set to be a big event. The\
  \ symbolic fight will happen as usual, and I''m making sure everyone remembers it''s for tradition - not for showing\
  \ off.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.33.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is already inspiring some heartfelt\
  \ conversations about traditions and memories. The symbolic fight is being treated with a bit of reverence this\
  \ year.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.34.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is seen not just as an event but\
  \ as a symbolic moment to acknowledge the struggles and resilience we''ve shown.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.35.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is already being overhyped, and\
  \ I''m trying to explain that the symbolic fight is meant to be symbolic, not an excuse to air grievances. There''s also\
  \ some confusion over whether bringing a ''Mek counts as "in the spirit of the holiday."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.36.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a little more personal\
  \ this time. After the fire, the symbolic fight will take place, but we''re encouraging people to think of it as more\
  \ of a tribute to overcoming hardships.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.37.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will include the traditional\
  \ symbolic fight, and honestly, I think people are more excited about the storytelling evolving around it than\
  \ the actual fighting. We''ll make sure it stays good-natured and fun.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.38.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire has inspired some friendly rivalry,\
  \ but everyone''s keeping it respectful. The symbolic fight will be staged with care, and I think it''s a healthy way\
  \ for people to channel some of that pent-up energy.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.39.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is shaping up to be more dramatic\
  \ than necessary, and I''ve had to veto at least three ideas involving flaming weapons.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.40.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is drawing interest, especially\
  \ the symbolic fight. It''s nice to see people channeling their energy into something positive, even if it''s a little\
  \ unconventional.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.41.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is looking like the highlight, but\
  \ I''m doing my best to make sure the symbolic fight doesn''t escalate into a real one. There''s some healthy competition\
  \ brewing, and I''m hoping it stays that way.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.42.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is shaping up to be a mix of\
  \ dramatic speeches and questionable combat moves. I saw one of the other admins practicing a slow-motion fall.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.43.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is seen as more than just a\
  \ tradition this year - it''s a moment to acknowledge what we''ve overcome. The symbolic fight will be carried out with\
  \ respect and a sense of unity.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.44.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is shaping up to be part celebration,\
  \ part "dramatic re-enactment of mythical battles." I''m reminding everyone that "symbolic combat" doesn''t mean "actual\
  \ wrestling," but the message isn''t sticking. So I''m just hoping nobody pulls a muscle.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.45.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is shaping up to be a lively event.\
  \ The symbolic fight has inspired a lot of friendly competition, and it''s honestly nice to see people laughing about\
  \ it.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.46.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire has become a logistical challenge,\
  \ mainly because half the unit insists on using "authentic combat stances" during the symbolic fight. Apparently, last\
  \ year''s techniques were "not historically accurate."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.47.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is about more than just tradition\
  \ this year - it''s a way to feel grounded and connected despite the challenges.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.48.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is turning into some kind of theatrical\

  \ techs decided that a fog machine would "add gravitas."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.49.planetside.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire is getting the red-carpet treatment. There''s\

winterHoliday.message.dayZero.11.planetside.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have another bonfire, a gift exchange, and a\

winterHoliday.message.dayZero.29.planetside.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include another bonfire, gift exchange, and\

winterHoliday.message.dayZero.30.planetside.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night is the main event and we''re holding nothing back:\

winterHoliday.message.dayZero.35.planetside.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night is shaping up to be less dramatic - a bonfire, a\

winterHoliday.message.dayZero.49.transit.paragraph.0.ic=The unit is doing their best to keep the\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:WINTER_HOLIDAY''>Winter Holidays</a> meaningful despite being in JumpShip transit. There''s a quiet\
  \ determination to find some comfort and familiarity, even in the middle of space.
#### Paragraph 1
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.0.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ve decided to go with a\
  \ holographic fire display in the cargo bay. Two volunteers will stage the symbolic fight with some sparring routines,\
  \ but we''re keeping it light to avoid injuries in transit.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.1.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll have a virtual fire\
  \ projection in the common area. The symbolic fight will be a shadow match using the holo-fire as a backdrop. It''s\
  \ surprisingly atmospheric, considering our cramped quarters.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.2.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire projection, since\
  \ setting things on fire in a pressurized tin can is generally frowned upon. Instead of the usual fight, we''ll have a\
  \ Zero-G mime battle - two volunteers acting out an epic duel without actually touching each other. It''s a mix of\
  \ theater and combat training.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.3.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''re using a holographic flame\
  \ in the hangar bay, keeping it safe and contained. Instead of the usual fight, we''re encouraging a mock storytelling\
  \ duel where participants narrate their "most epic battles" in a dramatic fashion.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.4.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ve set up a virtual fire that\
  \ doesn''t risk the oxygen supply. The symbolic fight has been replaced with a dance-off, because why not embrace the\
  \ absurdity at this point?</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.5.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll use a holographic fire and\
  \ hold a storytelling circle where unit members share memorable moments. The symbolic fight will be more of a dramatic\
  \ reenactment than an actual duel.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.6.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''re doing a holo-fire in the\
  \ common area. Instead of the usual fight, we''re having a story battle where two unit members dramatically recount\
  \ the most ridiculous "heroic" moments they''ve experienced. Points will be awarded for exaggeration.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.7.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire projected on the\
  \ bulkhead. The symbolic fight has been replaced with a paper-rock-scissors tournament because, apparently, that''s\
  \ less likely to break a nose.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.8.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a virtual fire projection in\
  \ the mess hall. Instead of an actual fight, we''re holding a debate duel - two people arguing about who would win a\
  \ hypothetical brawl while everyone else votes. No actual punches will be thrown (hopefully).</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.9.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ve set up a holo-fire display,\
  \ and instead of a fight, we''ll have a talent show with combat-themed skits. Everyone seems pretty enthusiastic\
  \ about it.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.10.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ve got a holo-flame set up,\
  \ and instead of a fight, it''s a charades battle themed around famous historical duels. One guy tried to rehearse\
  \ floating combat moves. I shut that down fast.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.11.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area. Instead of the usual fight, we''ll host a story night about battles won and lost, allowing unit members to\
  \ share their experiences.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.12.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''re projecting a holo-fire in\
  \ the hangar and hosting a mock storytelling battle where unit members dramatically recount their most exaggerated\
  \ combat stories. Points for creativity and sheer nonsense.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.13.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be simulated with a holo-fire in\
  \ the common area. Instead of a physical fight, we''ll hold a debate duel where two volunteers argue over the most\
  \ legendary MekWarrior of all time. It should keep the spirit without risking injury.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.14.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''re projecting a virtual flame\
  \ and hosting a theatrical reenactment of the "Battle of the Great Hot Dog Incident" from last year. Two volunteers\
  \ are already arguing about costume choices.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.15.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll use a holographic display\
  \ in the cargo bay. Instead of a fight, we''re encouraging an open discussion where unit members share stories of\
  \ resilience, past battles, or just moments of hope. It''s shaping up to be special.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.16.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will feature a holographic flame\
  \ projected in the cargo bay. Instead of an actual fight, we''ll have a comedy improv duel where two people\
  \ dramatically argue about who''s the better MekWarrior.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.17.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be simulated with a holographic\
  \ fire, and instead of a combat duel, we''ll hold a discussion circle where unit members share reflections on resilience\
  \ and overcoming challenges. It''s more introspective than usual, but fitting for the circumstances.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.18.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll have a holo-fire and a\
  \ choreographed dance battle. Don''t ask me how that became the traditional symbolic fight substitute, but here we\
  \ are.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.19.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire display in the\
  \ mess hall, and instead of a fight, we''ll have a poetry session with themes of hope and perseverance. It promises to\
  \ be nothing short of memorable, as I''m not entirely sure our MekWarriors can read.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.20.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will involve a holographic fire\
  \ projection, and instead of a combat reenactment, we will conduct a "Strategic Posturing Contest" to determine who\
  \ can deliver the most commanding presence without moving.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.21.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ a fight, we''ll host a space-themed trivia competition. It''s surprisingly competitive already, and I''m pretty sure\
  \ the MekTechs are assembling a fact-checking committee.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.22.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll have a holo-fire projected\
  \ in the cargo bay. Instead of the usual fight, we''re doing a dramatic storytelling duel where volunteers recount\
  \ their most exaggerated ''Mek battles. I''ve already heard someone recreating their "death speech." Nobody has the\
  \ heart to tell them that they haven''t died yet.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.23.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ the usual fight, we''ll have a circle of stories, where unit members share memories of past holidays or moments of\
  \ resilience. It''s more subdued than usual, but it feels right.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.24.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area. Instead of the usual combat reenactment, we''re hosting a paper-rock-scissors tournament. It''s low-risk and at\
  \ least won''t result in bruises.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.25.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holographic flame with a\
  \ symbolic team-building challenge where pairs of unit members will share stories of overcoming hardships together.\
  \ It''s more reflective than combative, but it''s building camaraderie.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.26.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will feature a holo-fire and a "Mock\
  \ Combat Interpretive Dance" where two brave souls will act out a symbolic battle to the soundtrack of old Terran\
  \ space shanties. I''m pretty sure it''ll be unintentionally hilarious.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.27.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ the usual fight, they''re staging a dramatic reading of "Legendary ''Mek Battles," complete with over-the-top sound\
  \ effects. Someone is trying to convince me that they need a spotlight.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.28.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll have a holographic flame\
  \ projected in the common area. Instead of the usual fight, we''ll hold a storytelling contest where volunteers recount\
  \ famous battles with their own creative flair.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.29.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the mess hall,\
  \ and instead of fighting, we''ll host a trivia showdown on famous battles and historical MekWarriors. It''s surprisingly\
  \ competitive already.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.30.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holographic flame set up in\
  \ the cargo bay. Instead of a fight, we''ll hold a memory-sharing circle, where unit members talk about past holidays\
  \ and moments of triumph.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.31.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area. Instead of the usual combat reenactment, we''re doing a "Dramatic Tale of Glory" contest. The rules are simple:\
  \ exaggerate your most mundane day into an epic saga.</p>\
  <p>If you''re up for hearing about the "the great laundry incident", you should swing by.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.32.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night bonfire, we''ll use a holographic flame\
  \ and have a round table storytelling session where unit members share personal anecdotes or inspiring tales from past\
  \ battles. It''s about reflecting on our collective resilience.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.33.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ the usual fight, we''re hosting a "Tall Tales" competition. Whoever tells the most exaggerated and completely\
  \ improbable story wins bragging rights for the week.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.34.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ a fight, we''re hosting a "Heroic Boasting Contest." The idea is to tell the most ridiculously exaggerated story of\
  \ personal triumph while everyone else judges the creativity - and the sheer nonsense.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.35.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holographic flame in the\
  \ common area. Instead of the traditional fight, we''ll have a "Resilience Circle" where unit members share stories of\
  \ challenges they''ve faced and how they pulled through. It''s about remembering why we keep pushing forward.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.36.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will feature a holographic flame.\
  \ Instead of a symbolic fight, we''re holding a debate on the most overhyped ''Mek of all time. I''m betting on at least\
  \ three people defending the Mackie purely out of principle.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.37.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area. Instead of a physical fight, we''re hosting a story swap where unit members share their most memorable battles\
  \ or personal triumphs. It''s more about connection than competition this year.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.38.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ the usual fight, we''ll have a story challenge where unit members recount their most "glorious defeats." It''s a bit\
  \ tongue-in-cheek, but it''s keeping everyone entertained.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.39.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holographic flame set up\
  \ in the mess hall. Instead of fighting, we''ll have a creative problem-solving challenge where teams figure out\
  \ hypothetical scenarios like "How would you defeat a ''Mek with just duct tape?"</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.40.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will feature a holo-fire in the mess\
  \ hall, and instead of a physical fight, we''ll host a debate on the most epic BattleMek ever designed. Expect\
  \ passionate arguments and questionable logic.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.41.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area, and instead of the usual symbolic fight, we''re hosting a "Most Absurd Combat Story" contest. Points will be\
  \ awarded for creativity, blatant exaggeration, and sheer nonsense.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.42.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire projected in the\
  \ hangar bay. Instead of a fight, we''re going with a "Heroic Gesture Contest" -  where participants overact their way\
  \ through fake heroic speeches. Should be entertaining, if not entirely sensible. A betting pool is forming over how\
  \ many middle fingers we''ll see.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.43.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire, and instead of\
  \ the symbolic fight, we''ll have a story circle where unit members share their favorite holiday memories or moments\
  \ that remind them of home.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.44.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>For the fifth night, instead of a fight, we''re hosting a\
  \ "Tall Tale Contest" where unit members one-up each other with increasingly ridiculous (but mostly harmless) stories\
  \ of their "greatest victories." Should be entertaining.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.45.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area. Instead of a symbolic fight, we''re going with a "Grievance Venting Session" - an informal chance for people to\
  \ humorously complain about the most minor annoyances. It''s surprisingly popular. Your name has been mentioned\
  \ multiple times.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.46.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the hangar\
  \ bay. Instead of fighting, we''ll host a "Heroic Retelling" where unit members dramatically reenact their most mundane\
  \ daily tasks - like fixing the coffee machine - as if they were legendary battles.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.47.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will feature a holographic flame in\
  \ the mess hall. Instead of the usual symbolic fight, we''re hosting a shared reflection session, where everyone can\
  \ express something they''re grateful for or share a moment of personal growth. It''s turning into something surprisingly\
  \ meaningful.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.48.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holo-fire in the common\
  \ area, and instead of a fight, we''ll host a "Who Survived the Worst Ration Meal" storytelling contest. Apparently,\
  \ last month''s mashed ''potato'' incident is a hot contender.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.49.transit.paragraph.1.ic=<p>The fifth night bonfire will be a holographic flame in the\
  \ common area. Instead of the usual fight, we''ll have a circle of reflection, where each person can share something\
  \ they''ve learned or a challenge they''ve overcome. It''s about recognizing growth and resilience.</p>
#### Paragraph 2
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.0.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a projected bonfire on the\
  \ mess hall screen, a small gift exchange, and a meal made from our most tolerable rations. The kitchen team is adding\
  \ a few spice mixes to make it feel a bit more festive.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.1.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a simulated bonfire on the\
  \ main display, a gift exchange, and a communal meal - ration packs with a twist. The mess unit is experimenting with\
  \ mixing flavor packs to make something resembling stew.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.2.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a virtual campfire on the big\
  \ screen, a small gift exchange, and a feast that''s 50% imagination, 50% rehydrated rations. The unit''s in good\
  \ spirits despite the lack of open flames.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.3.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a projection bonfire, a gift\
  \ swap, and a shared meal. We''re working with what we''ve got, and morale is surprisingly high given the situation.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.4.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a projected bonfire, a low-effort\
  \ gift exchange, and whatever creative culinary concoction the mess hall can manage. At least spirits are up, or maybe\
  \ they''ve finally lost it.</p>\
  <p>Let me know if you want to judge the dance moves.
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.5.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual campfire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal that''s as festive as rations allow. It may not be perfect, but it''s keeping morale high.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.6.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a virtual bonfire, gift exchange,\
  \ and an attempt at a festive meal. The kitchen unit is experimenting with ration recipes, and I''m cautiously\
  \ optimistic.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.7.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>For the eleventh night, we''ll project a fireplace screensaver,\
  \ swap some tiny gifts, and eat whatever doesn''t taste like cardboard. Morale might not skyrocket, but at least\
  \ they''re trying.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.8.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will be a virtual campfire with a gift\
  \ exchange and a "creative cooking contest" using ration packs. I''ve already heard someone suggesting "Spicy Space\
  \ Slop Surprise."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.9.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another projected bonfire,\
  \ gift exchange, and some creatively prepared rations. The kitchen team is calling one of the dishes "Holiday Mystery\
  \ Stew" - I''m not sure if that''s comforting or not.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.10.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will involve a virtual fireplace, a gift\
  \ swap, and an ambitious attempt at cooking "Ration Casserole." If it doesn''t explode, I''ll consider it a success.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.11.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a virtual fire, a small gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal that''s as festive as rations can get. Everyone''s putting in the effort to make it meaningful.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.12.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a virtual bonfire, a small gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal featuring "reimagined rations." The kitchen team has started calling it "Space Cuisine."</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.13.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a projected bonfire, a modest\
  \ gift exchange, and a shared meal. We''ve managed to secure a few extra condiments to make the rations a bit more\
  \ tolerable. Hurray for expired ketchup.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.14.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will be another simulated fire, a gift\
  \ swap, and a communal meal where the highlight will probably be guessing what''s actually in the ''stew.''</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.15.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a virtual campfire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal that''s more about sharing than the actual food. It''s not ideal, but the unit''s making the most\
  \ of it.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.16.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>For the eleventh night, we''ll have another virtual bonfire,\
  \ a gift exchange, and a "best attempt at making rations taste good" contest. It''s bound to be creative, if not\
  \ entirely edible.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.17.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual campfire, a simple\
  \ gift exchange, and a meal where everyone contributes a bit of creativity. It''s more about togetherness than the\
  \ actual food. Which is fortunate because these ''Mek heads <i>cannot</i> cook.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.18.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include another projected bonfire, a\
  \ gift exchange, and a "creative ration sculpting contest." One guy is planning to shape mashed potatoes into a\
  \ simulacrum of your head.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.19.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual bonfire, a small\
  \ gift exchange, and a shared meal that might not be gourmet but will be prepared with the most important ingredient\
  \ of all: utter desperation.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.20.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a digital bonfire, gift\
  \ exchanges, and a meal that may or may not be identifiable. Spirits remain cautiously optimistic.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.21.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a virtual fire, a small gift\
  \ swap, and an attempt at a festive meal. Someone''s experimenting with turning ration bars into cookies. I''m\
  \ skeptical.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.22.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will be another virtual bonfire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal where someone is insisting on making "Holiday Ration Surprise." I think the real surprise will\
  \ be if it''s edible.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.23.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will be a virtual bonfire, a modest gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal where people are sharing their best "home-cooked" ration recipes. It''s not much, but it''s a way\
  \ to stay connected.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.24.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will be another virtual bonfire, a small\
  \ gift swap, and whatever passes for a celebratory meal. I''m just hoping the ration bar cake doesn''t taste like\
  \ compressed cardboard.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.25.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a virtual fire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a communal meal where people contribute their most creative takes on the rations. Spirits are high,\
  \ and it''s heartening to see.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.26.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a projected bonfire, gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal where we''ll see who can make the most bizarre but edible dish from standard rations. I''m equal\
  \ parts curious and terrified.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.27.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another virtual fire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal. Someone suggested turning the galley into a "space diner" for the night. I''m not sure where\
  \ they''re finding the optimism.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.28.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual bonfire, a small\
  \ gift exchange, and a communal meal. The mess team is working on a few creative ration combinations to make it feel\
  \ more festive.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.29.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a projected fire, a small\
  \ gift exchange, and a meal featuring "Holiday Surprise Stew." I''m cautiously optimistic about the outcome.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.30.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another virtual fire, a gift\
  \ swap, and a simple meal where everyone contributes something small. It''s a way to feel connected, even out here.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.31.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a projected bonfire, a gift\
  \ swap, and a feast that will probably feature ration-based culinary experiments. If nothing explodes, I''ll call it a\
  \ win.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.32.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another virtual bonfire, a\
  \ gift exchange, and a communal meal that''s simple but heartfelt. Everyone''s pitching in to make it special.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.33.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a projected bonfire, a small\
  \ gift swap, and a meal where the mess team is trying to make "festive ration wraps." I''m cautiously optimistic.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.34.transit.paragraph.2.ic=p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual bonfire, a gift swap,\
  \ and a meal where the challenge is to make something out of rations that doesn''t taste like cardboard. I''m not holding\
  \ my breath, but spirits are high.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.35.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another virtual fire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a shared meal. Everyone''s pitching in to make it feel as festive as possible.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.36.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a projected bonfire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal where "Festive Stew" is the main course - ingredients still questionable.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.37.transit.paragraph.2.ic=p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual bonfire, a small\
  \ gift exchange, and a communal meal where we''ll do our best to make rations taste like something worth celebrating.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.38.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a projected bonfire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal where the challenge is to make something edible from standard rations. We''re optimistic.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.39.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include another virtual bonfire, a\
  \ gift exchange, and a meal where the mess team is trying to make something resembling pie from ration packs. I''m\
  \ expecting "the emotional concept of pie" at best.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.40.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include another projected fire, a\
  \ gift swap, and a meal made from the most creatively combined rations. Someone mentioned attempting "Marvelous Moliday\
  \ Meatloaf," which sounds both ambitious and slightly terrifying. And no, the ''M'' isn''t a typo, that''s just what\
  \ they''re calling it.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.41.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual fire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a "Holiday Ration Bake-Off" that''s sure to result in some questionable culinary experiments.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.42.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a projected bonfire, a small\
  \ gift exchange, and a meal that the kitchen team swears will be "less terrible than usual." I''ll believe it when I\
  \ taste it.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.43.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include another virtual bonfire, a\
  \ gift exchange, and a communal meal. It''s not much, but it''s a way to feel connected.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.44.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another projected fire, a\
  \ gift swap, and a meal where everyone contributes one ingredient to the "Holiday Stew." Here''s hoping it doesn''t turn\
  \ into a complete science experiment.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.45.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature a virtual fire, a gift\
  \ exchange, and a meal where everyone votes on the "least terrible ration combination." I''m not holding my breath.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.46.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another virtual fire, a gift\
  \ swap, and a meal where everyone is encouraged to add one "secret ingredient" to the group stew. I''m cautiously\
  \ optimistic that it won''t be terrible.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.47.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will include a virtual bonfire, a small\
  \ gift exchange, and a meal where the unit is putting extra effort into making something comforting.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.48.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will have a projected bonfire, a gift swap,\
  \ and a communal meal where we''ll attempt to make "Holiday Hash" out of mystery ingredients. I''m not entirely sure\
  \ it''ll be edible, but the unit''s hopeful.</p>
winterHoliday.message.dayZero.49.transit.paragraph.2.ic=<p>The eleventh night will feature another virtual bonfire, a\
  \ small gift exchange, and a simple meal where everyone contributes something, no matter how small. It''s about\
  \ community and support.</p>
