AdminStrainNagDialog.ic={0}, my team is buckling under the strain. Memos are going unanswered. We''ve got people queuing\
  \ up outside with complaints. We''ve even got reports of unpaid salaries. People are getting angry, and if we don''t\
  \ solve the problem soon, they''re liable to quit.
AdminStrainNagDialog.ooc=Excess <a href=''GLOSSARY:ADMIN_STRAIN''>Administrative Strain</a> is addressed by hiring more\
  \ Admin/HR personnel. If that isn''t viable, consider assigning your current Admin personnel to multiple roles.</p>\

# End Contract Nag
EndContractNagDialog.ic={0}, a contract has reached its conclusion and requires your attention for\
  \ final resolution. While you may advance the day, I recommend addressing this to avoid delays in\
  \ resource allocation and payment. Confirm your decision to proceed.
EndContractNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve a contract by selecting the contract in the Briefing Room,\
  \ followed by 'Complete Mission'.</i>
