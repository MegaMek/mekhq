# Admin Strain
AdminStrainNagDialog.ic={0}, my team is currently overwhelmed by the size of the unit, and it''s\
  \ straining our ability to keep up with demand. We''re experiencing a significant increase in\
  \ complaints from personnel regarding long response times for administrative issues and delayed or\
  \ unpaid wages. The backlog is growing, and we''re not staffed to handle it effectively.\
  <p>Morale is beginning to suffer as a result. Several personnel have indicated that if these issues\
  \ are not addressed soon, they may consider resigning.</p>\
  <p>I recommend an immediate review of our HR staffing levels and resource allocation. We may need\
  \ to authorize additional personnel to reduce the backlog and restore confidence among the troops.\
  \ Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
AdminStrainNagDialog.ooc=Excess <a href=''GLOSSARY:ADMIN_STRAIN''>Administrative Strain</a> is addressed by hiring or\
  \ assigning more Admin/HR personnel.</p>\

# Deployment Shortfall
DeploymentShortfallNagDialog.ic={0}, I''ve received word from Allied Command that our unit has fallen\
  \ below the agreed deployment levels. They''ve noted that they are being forced to stretch their\
  \ resources to compensate for the shortfall.\
  <p>Allied Command has requested an immediate response on how we intend to address the situation.</p>\
  <p>I recommend we assess our current reserves and readiness levels to determine how quickly we can\
  \ bring our unit back to operational strength. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
DeploymentShortfallNagDialog.ooc=You should head to the Briefing Room and address this shortfall.\
  \ Remember, <a href=''GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS''>Combat Teams</a> assigned to the Auxiliary or\
  \ Reserve roles do not count towards deployment levels. Nor do Combat Teams assigned to the\
  \ Training role, unless the contract is Cadre Duty.\
  <p>While <a href=''GLOSSARY:STRATCON''>StratCon</a> is enabled, you will suffer a -1\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS''>CVP</a> penalty for each week you are below\
  \ deployment levels. This represents the additional strain your deficit places on allied forces\
  \ operating in the <a href='GLOSSARY:AREA_OF_OPERATIONS'>Area of Operations</a>.</p>\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# End Contract Nag
EndContractNagDialog.ic={0}, the unit''s current deployment has officially concluded. Allied Command\
  \ is awaiting formal confirmation before they can release us from our deployment obligations and\
  \ authorize the disbursement of any remaining funds owed.\
  <p>I recommend we finalize and submit the necessary after-action reports and administrative\
  \ documentation as soon as possible to avoid delays in fund release and to close out this deployment\
  \ cycle properly.</p>\
  <p>Once I have your confirmation, I''ll be able to coordinate this process with Allied Command. Let\
  \ me know how you''d like to proceed.</p>
EndContractNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve a contract by selecting the contract in the Briefing Room,\
  \ followed by ''Complete Mission''.\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Insufficient Astech Time
InsufficientAstechTimeNagDialog.ic={0}, my team is being stretched thin by the current workload. The\
  \ volume of maintenance and repair requests exceeds our available manpower, and there aren''t enough\
  \ hours in the day to complete all assigned tasks within acceptable timeframes. Backlogs are growing,\
  \ and we''re being forced to prioritize critical systems at the expense of routine maintenance.\
  <p>This situation is increasing the risk of equipment failures and compromising overall readiness.\
  \ I recommend either increasing available personnel through reassignment or adjusting operational\
  \ expectations to align with our current capacity. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
InsufficientAstechTimeNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve this issue by selecting ''Marketplace'' in the\
  \ toolbar, then ''Astech Pool,'' then selecting the option to bring all teams up to full strength.\
  \ If this does not resolve the issue, you have likely spread your techs too thinly by assigning\
  \ them to too many units. Consider hiring more techs.\
  <p>Alternatively, you may enable overtime, though this will significantly increase the Target\
  \ Numbers of Tech and Medical tasks.</p>\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Insufficient Astechs
InsufficientAstechsNagDialog.ic={0}, several of my teams are currently understaffed, which is making\
  \ it difficult to complete tasks effectively and on schedule. The reduced manpower is forcing us\
  \ to cut corners to meet deadlines, increasing the likelihood of task failure and compromising\
  \ overall maintenance quality.\
  <p>If this continues, we could face increased equipment downtime and operational failures. I\
  \ recommend reviewing staffing levels and considering either reassigning personnel or authorizing\
  \ additional recruitment to stabilize the situation. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
InsufficientAstechsNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve this issue by selecting ''Marketplace'' in the toolbar,\
  \ then ''Astech Pool,'' then selecting the option to bring all teams up to full strength. If this\
  \ does not resolve the issue, you have likely spread your techs too thinly by assigning them to too\
  \ many units. Consider hiring more techs.\

# Insufficient Medics
InsufficientMedicsNagDialog.ic={0}, several of my teams are currently understaffed, which is making\
  \ it difficult to provide effective care and complete essential medical tasks. The reduced personnel\
  \ is increasing response times and limiting our ability to handle multiple cases simultaneously.\
  \ This situation is creating a higher risk of treatment delays and medical errors.\
  <p>If this continues, it could compromise both unit health and operational readiness. I recommend\
  \ reviewing staffing levels and considering reassigning personnel or authorizing additional\
  \ recruitment to stabilize medical support. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
InsufficientMedicsNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve this issue by selecting ''Marketplace'' in the taskbar,\
  \ then ''Medic Pool,'' then selecting the option to bring all teams up to full strength.\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Invalid Faction
InvalidFactionNagDialog.ic={0}, our unit''s parent faction is no longer operational. It''s unclear\
  \ whether the faction has been destroyed or simply collapsed, but the result is the same - we''re\
  \ now without the necessary support structure to operate effectively.\
  <p>Supply chains, funding, and logistical coordination have all been disrupted, leaving the unit\
  \ in a precarious position.</p>\
  <p>I recommend assessing current stock levels and exploring potential alliances or agreements with\
  \ nearby factions to stabilize our operational footing. Please advise on how you''d like to\
  \ proceed.</p>
InvalidFactionNagDialog.ooc=You will need to select a new faction in the campaign options. Failure\
  \ to do this while using <a href=''GLOSSARY:STRATCON''>StratCon</a> will prevent contracts from\
  \ being generated.\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Unmaintained Units
UnmaintainedUnitsNagDialog.ic={0}, several units have not been formally assigned tech maintenance\
  \ crews, which is creating gaps in equipment upkeep and repair cycles. Without dedicated support,\
  \ these units are at increased risk of mechanical failures and reduced operational readiness.\
  <p>This situation needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further degradation of equipment. I\
  \ recommend reviewing personnel assignments and either reallocating existing tech teams or\
  \ authorizing additional staffing to cover the shortfall. Please advise on how you''d like to\
  \ proceed.</p>
UnmaintainedUnitsNagDialog.ooc=Head to the Hangar and right-click on each affected unit, choosing to\
  \ assign a tech as required. If you do not have enough techs, it''s possible to assign the same\
  \ tech to multiple units. However, this will reduce the time that tech has available to conduct\
  \ any necessary repairs. Generally, you want at least one tech per unit.\
  <p>Large vessels, such as DropShips, and conventional infantry are self-maintaining.</p>
# No Commander
NoCommanderNagDialog.ic=Our unit''s currently operating without a formally assigned commanding\
  \ officer. This lack of leadership is creating uncertainty in decision-making and slowing down\
  \ operational coordination. Without a clear chain of command, it will be challenging to maintain\
  \ discipline, execute orders effectively, and respond to emerging threats.\
  <p>I recommend that this issue be addressed as soon as possible by either appointing a permanent\
  \ commanding officer or designating an interim leader to restore command authority and operational\
  \ cohesion. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
NoCommanderNagDialog.ooc=You can assign one of your personnel as the campaign commander by\
  \ right-clicking on that character, navigating to Flags and selecting the Commander flag.</i>\

# Outstanding Scenarios
OutstandingScenariosNagDialog.ic={0}, our forces are currently in position to assault the enemy, but\
  \ they require final authorization to proceed. Without approval, they will be forced to withdraw\
  \ from the engagement, which could result in a lost tactical advantage and give the enemy time to\
  \ regroup.\
  <p>Time is critical. I recommend issuing authorization immediately to maintain operational momentum\
  \ and capitalize on our current positioning. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>\
  {1}
OutstandingScenariosNagDialog.ooc=If using <a href=''GLOSSARY:STRATCON''>StratCon</a>, you can pay 1\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:CONTRACT_VICTORY_POINTS''>CVP</a> to tactically withdraw from any scenario\
  \ marked as a <a href=''GLOSSARY:TURNING_POINT''>Turning Point</a> or\
  \ <a href=''GLOSSARY:CRISIS_SCENARIO''>Crisis</a>. Withdrawal is free for all other scenarios.\

# Pregnant Combatant
PregnantCombatantNagDialog.ic={0}, our records indicate that there are pregnant personnel assigned\
  \ to combat duties. This presents a significant risk to both the individuals and their unborn\
  \ children.\
  <p>I recommend that these personnel be reassigned to non-combat roles immediately to protect their\
  \ health and ensure compliance with medical and operational guidelines. Please advise on how you''d\
  \ like to proceed.</p>
PregnantCombatantNagDialog.ooc=Pregnant personnel are highlighted in <b>Green</b> in the Personnel\
  \ tab. Alternatively, you can change the Personnel tab filter to ''Dates'' and sort by ''Due Date''.\
  \ This will show all pregnant personnel.\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Prisoners
PrisonersNagDialog.ic={0}, the current operation has concluded, but the unit''s still holding a number\
  \ of Prisoners of War whose status remains undetermined. Without clear guidance on their disposition,\
  \ we face potential security and logistical challenges in managing their continued detention.\
  <p>I recommend seeking immediate clarification on whether these prisoners should be transferred to\
  \ Allied Command, released, or retained for further interrogation. Please advise on how you''d like\
  \ to proceed.</p>
PrisonersNagDialog.ooc=You should head to the Personnel tab and set the filter to ''Prisoners or War\
  \ and Bondsmen''. Right-clicking on a prisoner will allow you to free, ransom or execute them. If\
  \ you are currently off-world, you can choose to jettison your prisoners.\
  <p>If you are using the <b>MekHQ</b> prisoner capture style, you are unable to ransom prisoners in\
  \ this way. All prisoner ransoms are conducted during a contract.</p>\
  <p>If you are lucky, some prisoners may be willing to join your campaign. These prisoners are\
  \ labeled as ''Prisoner*''</p>\

# Unable to Afford Expenses
UnableToAffordExpensesNagDialog.ic={0}, payday is scheduled for tomorrow, but the unit currently\
  \ lacks the funds to cover the full payroll. The total payroll obligation amounts to {1} C-Bills,\
  \ while the unit''s available funds stand at {2} C-Bills. This leaves us with a shortfall of {3}\
  \ C-Bills.\
  <p>Without additional funding, we will be unable to pay all personnel in full, which could negativel\
  y impact morale and operational stability. I recommend seeking emergency funding to cover the\
  \ deficit. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
UnableToAffordExpensesNagDialog.ooc=Consider selling off unwanted units or parts. If all else fails,\
  \ you can take out a loan in the Finances tab. Failing to pay your personnel will have a permanent\
  \ impact on their <a href=''GLOSSARY:LOYALTY''>Loyalty</a>.\

# Unable to Afford Next Jump
UnableToAffordJumpNagDialog.ic={0}, we''re unable to cover the expenses for the next JumpShip transit.\
  \ The JumpShip liaison has quoted a fee of {1} C-Bills for the jump, but the unit''s available funds\
  \ currently stand at only {2} C-Bills, leaving a shortfall of {3} C-Bills.\
  <p>Without payment, the JumpShip will refuse to initiate the jump, which will delay our movement\
  \ and could compromise mission timelines. I recommend either securing additional funds. Please\
  \ advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
UnableToAffordJumpNagDialog.ooc=You will be unable to jump until you resolve this situation.\
  <p>Consider selling off unwanted units, or parts. If all else fails, you can take out a loan in the\
  \ Finances tab.</p>\

# Unable to Afford Loan Payments
UnableToAffordLoanPaymentNagDialog.ic={0}, we''re scheduled to make a loan payment tomorrow totaling\
  \ {1} C-Bills. However, the unit''s available funds currently stand at {2} C-Bills, leaving us short\
  \ {3} C-Bills.\
  <p>Failure to make the payment on time could result in penalties or damage the unit''s financial\
  \ standing with creditors. We have some equipment we could sell; it might be worth looking for\
  \ buyers. Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
UnableToAffordLoanPaymentNagDialog.ooc=You will be unable to proceed beyond tomorrow until this\
  \ situation is resolved.\
  <p>Consider selling off unwanted units or parts. If all else fails, you might be able to take\

  \ leaving us short {3} C-Bills.\
  <p>We could postpone some expenses by removing items from the shopping list, or reducing the quantity of some items.\
  \ Also we might be able to increase our funds by selling off unwanted units or parts. If all else fails,\
  \ we can take out a loan in the Finances tab.</p>\

# Unresolved StratCon Contacts
UnresolvedStratConContactsNagDialog.ic={0}, long-range sensors have detected enemy activity within\
  \ our Area of Operations. Allied Command has requested that we resolve the situation, but no combat\
  \ teams have been assigned to respond yet.\
  <p>Given the proximity and potential threat level, I recommend we assign a rapid response force\

# Untreated Personnel
UntreatedPersonnelNagDialog.ic={0}, we currently have a number of wounded personnel who have not been\
  \ formally assigned to medical teams. As a result, they''re clogging up the waiting room and being\
  \ left on stretchers in the hallways.\
  <p>This situation is putting strain on both medical staff and resources, increasing the risk of\
  \ treatment delays and worsening medical outcomes. I recommend assigning additional medical teams\
  \ or reallocating existing personnel to clear the backlog and restore order to the facility.</p>\
  <p>Please advise on how you''d like to proceed.</p>
UntreatedPersonnelNagDialog.ooc=You should go to the Infirmary tab and assign your wounded personnel\
  \ to Doctors. If you have insufficient Doctors, consider reassigning personnel so that the most\
  \ critically injured or essential personnel are treated first. Alternatively, hire more Doctors.\
  <p>If you don''t want to manually assign Doctors, there is the option to automatically optimize\
  \ medical assignments. This will assign the most injured personnel to the Doctors with the highest\
  \ skill. When using this option, injured prisoners will always be placed in the queue behind\
  \ injured personnel.</p>\
  <p>In MekHQ Options you can set medical optimization to run automatically when advancing day.</p>\
