# Admin Strain
AdminStrainNagDialog.ic={0}, my team is buckling under the strain. Memos are going unanswered. We''ve got people queuing\
  \ up outside with complaints. We''ve even got reports of unpaid salaries. People are getting angry, and if we don''t\
  \ solve the problem soon, they''re liable to quit.
AdminStrainNagDialog.ooc=Excess <a href=''GLOSSARY:ADMIN_STRAIN''>Administrative Strain</a> is addressed by hiring more\
  \ Admin/HR personnel. If that isn''t viable, consider assigning your current Admin personnel to multiple roles.</p>\

# Deployment Shortfall
DeploymentShortfallNagDialog.ic={0}, deployment levels have fallen below contractual requirements\
  \ for one or more contracts. While advancing the day is an option, it may strain relations with\
  \ our employer. Do you wish to continue without addressing this?
DeploymentShortfallNagDialog.ooc=You should head to the Briefing Room and address this shortfall.\
  \ Remember, <a href=''GLOSSARY:COMBAT_TEAMS''>Combat Teams</a> assigned to the Auxiliary or\
  \ Reserve roles do not count towards deployment levels. Nor do Combat Teams assigned to the\
  \ Training role, unless the contract is Cadre Duty.\

# End Contract Nag

  \ final resolution. While you may advance the day, I recommend addressing this to avoid delays in\
  \ resource allocation and payment. Confirm your decision to proceed.

  \ followed by ''Complete Mission''.\

# Insufficient Astech Time
InsufficientAstechTimeNagDialog.ic={0}, current maintenance requires an additional {1}\
  \ {1, choice, 0#Astechs|1#Astech|2#Astechs}. Proceeding without resolving this will prevent some\
  \ units from being maintained. Confirm your decision to advance the day.
InsufficientAstechTimeNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve this issue by selecting ''Marketplace'' in the\
  \ toolbar, then ''Astech Pool,'' then selecting the option to bring all teams up to full strength.\
  \ If this does not resolve the issue, you have likely spread your techs too thinly by assigning\
  \ them to too many units. Consider hiring more techs.\
  <p>Alternatively, you may enable overtime, though this will significantly increase the Target\
  \ Numbers of Tech and Medical tasks.</p>\
  <p>If you accidentally suppress this warning, you can re-enable it in MekHQ Options.</p>
# Insufficient Astechs
InsufficientAstechsNagDialog.ic={0}, a shortage of {1} {1, choice, 0#Astechs|1#Astech|2#Astechs} is\

  \ recruiting additional personnel. Confirm your intent to advance the day under these conditions.
InsufficientAstechsNagDialog.ooc=You can resolve this issue by selecting ''Marketplace'' in the toolbar,\
  \ then ''Astech Pool,'' then selecting the option to bring all teams up to full strength. If this\

  \ many units. Consider hiring more techs.\

# Insufficient Medics
InsufficientMedicsNagDialog.ic={0}, our medical teams are short by {1} {1, choice, 0#Medics|1#Medic|2#Medics}.\

  \ being generated.\

# Unmaintained Units
UnmaintainedUnitsNagDialog.ic={0}, we have units that have not been assigned a tech. This will\
  \ result in degradation and increased repairs. Confirm if you wish to advance the day without\
  \ addressing this issue.
UnmaintainedUnitsNagDialog.ooc=Head to the Hangar and right-click on each affected unit, choosing to\
  \ assign a tech as required. If you do not have enough techs, it is possible to assign the same\
  \ tech to multiple units. However, this will reduce the time that tech has available to conduct\
  \ any necessary repairs. Generally, you want at least one tech per unit.\
  <p>Large vessels, such as DropShips, and conventional infantry are self-maintaining.</p>\
# No Commander
NoCommanderNagDialog.ic=Please be advised that no commanding officer is currently assigned\
  \ to our unit. This could affect operational outcomes and mission planning. Confirm your intent\

  \ you are currently off-world, you can choose to jettison your prisoners.\
  <p>If you are using the <b>MekHQ</b> prisoner capture style, you are unable to ransom prisoners in\
  \ this way. All prisoner ransoms are conducted during a contract.</p>\
  <p>If you are lucky, some prisoners may be willing to join your campaign. These prisoners are\
  \ labeled as ''Prisoner*''</p>\

  \ inefficiencies. Confirm if you wish to proceed regardless.

  \ personnel in MekHQ Options.</p>\
