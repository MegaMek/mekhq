# Inner Sphere Generic
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.innerSphere=The rain hadn''t stopped in two days. It didn''t\
  \ pour - just misted endlessly, beading on steel plating, soaking into fatigues. {0} stood beneath the \
  open hangar awning, staring at the deactivated BattleMeks. Silent hulks. Their cockpits were sealed. No tech\
  \ crews. No pilots.\
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} read the transmission again on a datapad, as if repetition might reveal an escape \
  clause.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>"By order of High Command, your unit is hereby dissolved..."</em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{10} didn''t speak, just lowered the pad and waited.</p>\
  <p>{1} inhaled the oily scent of coolant runoff and dead ambition. "They''re taking everything."</p>\
  <p>"Personnel have forty-eight hours to report in. ''Meks are being boxed for redistribution." {10}''s voice was \
  dry. Defeated.</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out across the tarmac. Men and women stood in quiet clusters. No shouting. No rebellion. Just the \
  ache of shared failure. "{18} die here."</p>\
  <p>{10} offered a stiff nod. "Banner''s already down. You wanna say something to them?"</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "They don''t need speeches. They need jobs."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned, walking back into the dim compound. No ceremony. No salute. Just the sound of doors hissing shut \
  behind {5}.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.innerSphere=The DropShip drifted in silence between jumps. \
  Inside, it felt like a mausoleum.\
  <p>{0} sat alone in the briefing room, eyes on the holotable that used to chart mission deployments. Now \
  it displayed a single line of text:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>"All personnel are to report to reassignment centers within 48 hours."</em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The map of the Inner Sphere flickered and vanished.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered, locking the door behind {14}. "It''s official. Quartermasters are sending codes to \
  deactivate the ''Meks. We don''t even get to park them ourselves."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s knuckles whitened against the table''s edge. "I gave this unit years of my life, we all did."</p>\
  <p>"I know."</p>\
  <p>{2} tapped the back of a stylus against {7} leg. "We didn''t lose because we quit. We lost because command stopped\
  \ caring."</p>\
  <p>{10} raised {16} eyes. "They''ll erase our name from the rolls."</p>\
  <p>{1} stood. "Then we remember it ourselves."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into {7} uniform jacket, pulled out a stitched unit patch, the stylized symbol of {18}. \
  {2} set it on the table, pressed it flat.</p>\
  <p>"I''m not going to forget."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.innerSphere=The command tent was quiet. No sirens. No shouting. Just \
  the steady drone of portable generators and the soft static of a dead comms channel. {0} sat at the edge \
  of the map table, staring at deployment markers like they were gravestones.\
  <p>{9} entered, clipboard tucked under one arm. "We''re fueled. Weapons hot. The manifest reads as routine \
  field repositioning."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look up. "That''s what this whole career has felt like. Routine. we just... kept going because no one \
  wanted to say stop."</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned against a crate. "You think they''ll care we left?"</p>\
  <p>"They''ll care about the tonnage. Not the names."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks powered up in slow sequence. Not with defiance. Just with finality.</p>\
  <p>{10} looked toward the exit. "You sure this isn''t just exhaustion talking?"</p>\
  <p>{1} stood. "Of course I''m exhausted. That''s the only time you can see clearly."</p>\
  <p>They left the map blinking alone in the dark - battleplans abandoned, like the promises that drew them here.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.innerSphere=The DropShip drifted through the black, cold and clean. No \
  banners. No orders. Just silence and a full hold.\
  <p>{0} sat in the narrow lounge, staring at an old holopic of {7} childhood friends - half the faces \
  already dead or forgotten. Fading relics of a better time.</p>\
  <p>{9} walked in, leaned on the hatch. "Jump Captain says everything is good to go. Jump point is \
  off-network. Pirate."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Good."</p>\
  <p>"We never gave Command a reason," {10} said. "You sure that''s wise?"</p>\
  <p>"They never gave us one either," {1} replied. "Seems fair."</p>\
  <p>The lights dimmed. Outside, nothing waited. And that was fine.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll call us traitors. Cowards."</p>\
  <p>"They can call us whatever fills the report," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>The ship burned forward. No anthem. No flag. Just the gravity of decision, and the relief of not looking back.</p>

# Capellan Confederation
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.CC=The black-and-green crest of the Confederation still \
  hung over the compound gates, but no one saluted it anymore. Not today.\
  <p>{0} stood on the central parade ground, datapad clutched behind {7} back, face unreadable. Rain \
  slicked the red-tinted concrete. {9} approached quietly, boots precise, posture rigid - even now.</p>\
  <p>"Order''s confirmed," {10} said. "Redistribution team lands in six hours."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded once. "And the personnel?"</p>\
  <p>"Reporting for reassignment. No resistance. They know what this is."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s eyes flicked to the hangars. Empty already. The ''Meks had been powered down and locked before the message \
  even arrived - Capellan efficiency at work.</p>\
  <p>"We failed them," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>"No, {20}," {10} replied flatly. "We failed the Chancellor."</p>\
  <p>A pause. Then {1} slowly removed the unit insignia from {7} shoulder - {18}'' stylized scale now \
  dulled by grime and silence. {2} set it down on a bench.</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t look away. "Orders are orders."</p>\
  <p>"Yes," {1} said, voice a dull echo. "And we are no longer worthy of them."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.CC=Inside the DropShip, the crew quarters were silent. \
  The command deck had received the formal disbandment message six hours prior. No one questioned it. That would have\
  \ been... inappropriate.\
  <p>{0} sat in the officers'' lounge. Across from {5}, {9} stood with {16} hands folded behind \
  {16} back.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Effective immediately, all personnel are to report for reassignment or discharge..."<br>\
  "...logistical mismanagement."<br>\
  "...dishonor."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The phrases scrolled endlessly on the terminal.</p>\
  <p>{10} broke the silence. "Crew''s been sorted. Officers split across assignments. Logistics has codes for the \
  hangar bays."</p>\
  <p>{1} stared at the terminal. "No court-martial. No appeal."</p>\
  <p>"This is Capellan mercy."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer. {2} reached into the drawer beside {5} and withdrew a small lacquered box - the last \
  ''{18}'' insignia, polished and sealed. {2} slid it across the table.</p>\
  <p>"To be archived," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} took it without ceremony. "It will be. Quietly."</p>\
  <p>The lights dimmed. The transmission ended. And another failed unit vanished into the folds of the \
  Confederation.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.CC=The briefing room reeked of coolant and stale promises. \
  {0} stood at the front, hands folded behind {7} back, expression flat. The Capellan serpent crest \
  glimmered dimly on the overhead projector, flickering like it knew the end was near.\
  <p>"It''s time," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{9} didn''t flinch. {11} leaned forward on the table, fingers interlocked. "We''re really doing \
  this?"</p>\
  <p>"We''re already halfway there," {1} said. "Logistics files scrubbed. Hangars prepped. Manifest doctored. All \
  that''s left is walking out the door."</p>\
  <p>{10} glanced at the door as if expecting agents from the Ministry of Information to burst through. "You know \
  what they''ll call us."</p>\
  <p>"They can call us anything they want. Doesn''t change what they''ve done." {1}''s voice didn''t rise. It didn''t need\
  \ to.</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks powered up under cover of routine drills. Their shadows stretched long against \
  the dusk. Every motion felt rehearsed.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll chase us." {10}''s voice was quiet now. Not afraid - just aware.</p>\
  <p>"Let them." {1} walked over to the cracked viewscreen and killed the projection. The room fell dark. "This isn''t\
  \ betrayal. It''s release."</p>\
  <p>{10} stood. "Then let''s get moving before the State changes its mind and remembers we exist."</p>\
  <p>No handshakes. No salute. Just two soldiers walking out of the room and into whatever came next.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.CC={0} stood in the dimly lit observation cradle of the \
  DropShip, staring into open space. The stars weren''t just stars tonight - they were options. Escape routes. Dead ends.\
  \ All the same.\
  <p>Behind {5}, the door hissed open. {9} stepped in, letting it seal shut behind {14} without a word.</p>\
  <p>"They''re going to notice," {10} said. "Missing ping off the relay net. No transponder bounce."</p>\
  <p>"The techs gave us six minutes of static," {1} replied, still facing the stars. "Then we disappear."</p>\
  <p>{10} approached slowly. "People are asking questions. They don''t say it out loud, but... they know something''s \
  off."</p>\
  <p>"Good. Means they''re still thinking." {1} turned now, finally, {7} eyes sharp. "That''s all I''ve ever wanted. For\
  \ them to think."</p>\
  <p>"And when the State thinks about us?" {10} asked. "What do we become?"</p>\
  <p>"Dust. Myths. Cautionary tales." {1} looked calm. Too calm. "Better that than obedient tools waiting for the \
  next command to crush us."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded once. Not agreement. Just readiness. "Then let''s make our exit a clean one."</p>\
  <p>Below decks, {18}'' equipment was being loaded for a mission that didn''t exist on any Capellan \
  manifest. The DropShip''s course had already shifted - slow, subtle, irreversible.</p>\
  <p>Whatever came next, they''d meet it on their own terms.</p>
# Draconis Combine
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.DC=The courtyard was swept clean. Even the ash from their \
  torched banners had been collected, as per protocol. {0} knelt on the stone tiles outside the command \
  building, hands resting calmly on {7} thighs. Rain traced lines down {7} face, indistinguishable from tears.\
  <p>{9} stood behind {5}, perfectly still. "Transmission confirmed. Effective immediately, {18} are disbanded under \
  Directive 52-Ni."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded once. "I saw the final order."</p>\
  <p>"Assets will be collected within the hour. Personnel are instructed to report to reassignment posts. The record \
  of our unit will be sealed."</p>\
  <p>{1} rose slowly, every motion deliberate. {2} turned to face the empty ''Mek hangars. "They won''t even remember \
  our name."</p>\
  <p>{10} bowed. "That is the point."</p>\
  <p>{1} unclipped the sword at {7} waist. Not to use it. Just to acknowledge it.</p>\
  <p>"Let our disgrace end with discipline," {3} said. "And nothing more."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.DC=The cabin of the DropShip was silent. No movement. No \
  voices. Just the faint hum of interstellar drift and the muted scroll of a terminal displaying the final order.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "This is the final transmission under your unit designation. {18} is to be disbanded..."<br>\
  "...systemic failure of leadership."<br>\
  "...record sealed."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood before the message alone. No ceremony. No final speech. Just duty, finished.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered from the corridor. "Dispersal teams are waiting at the next port. We are to report in \
  full uniform, without insignia."</p>\
  <p>{1} removed the patch from {7} arm and placed it carefully in a small box. Then {3} snapped the box shut and \
  handed it to {10}.</p>\
  <p>"For the archive," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "The record will be sealed, but we will remember."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t reply. {2} sat back down in the meditation posture, closed {7} eyes, and waited to arrive at oblivion \
  with dignity. With honor.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.DC=The courtyard was empty, save for the wind. {0} stood \
  beneath the red banner of House Kurita, head bowed - not in reverence, but memory. The kanji for "Honor through \
  Obedience" fluttered above like an accusation.\
  <p>Behind {5}, {9}''s footsteps were silent. "It''s done," {12} said. "Fuel lines rerouted. Comms scrubbed. \
  Tech crews think we''re running a night drill."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t turn. "They''ll call it cowardice."</p>\
  <p>"Let them." {10}''s voice was flat. "We''ll be dead to the Combine either way."</p>\
  <p>"Not dead," {1} whispered. "Erased. Struck from the rolls. Ancestors shamed. Name revoked."</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped closer. "We all followed your orders. We still are. You knew they''d never forgive hesitation."</p>\
  <p>{1} finally turned. {6} face was calm, but {7} eyes burned. "This isn''t hesitation. This is choice. The only one\
  \ they left me."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks moved under cover of moonlight, armor gleaming like curved blades. The hangar \
  crew had no idea what was happening. By the time they figured it out, {1}''s people would be gone.</p>\
  <p>"There is no path back," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Then we make a new one. One they will remember, even if they refuse to speak it."</p>\
  <p>And without another word, they walked into exile together - silent warriors who broke their oaths, but not their \
  souls.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.DC=The DropShip hummed with restrained power. In the observation deck, \
  {0} stared at a faded portrait of Coordinator Kurita etched into the glass. The etching shimmered \
  faintly, a ghost of discipline and judgement.\
  <p>"You said we''d never do this," {9} said quietly, arms folded behind {16} back in formal posture. "Not \
  without a cause worth dying for."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t respond. Not at first.</p>\
  <p>"You think I haven''t measured the weight of this dishonor?" {3} finally said. "You think I haven''t spent nights \
  counting the ancestors I''ve shamed?"</p>\
  <p>{10}''s expression didn''t change. "Then why now?"</p>\
  <p>{1} turned. "Because I still have warriors under my command. And no matter what flag they fly, they deserve more\
  \ than a silent death for someone else''s secret."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "Jump coordinates?"</p>\
  <p>"Loaded. Five systems outside the Combine''s declared territory. No beacons. No signatures."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll come for us."</p>\
  <p>"I hope they do."</p>\
  <p>Outside the JumpShip''s engines deepened to jump-prep whine. Meanwhile, a shrine to House Kurita sat in the mess \
  hall. No one had touched it. No one dared.</p>\
  <p>Honor was broken. But resolve was not.</p>\
  <p>{18} were already ghosts. Now they would decide who to haunt.</p>

# Lyran Commonwealth
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.LA=The order arrived with precise formatting and zero \
  delay - uploaded into every terminal simultaneously. A Lyran signature. {0} stood outside the vehicle bay\
  \ as logistics officers moved in with crates and barcode scanners.\
  <p>"By directive of the Strategic Forces Audit Commission..." {9} read from the noteputer, then lowered it. "We''re \
  done, {20}. All assets to be surrendered. Personnel to be reassigned or discharged. Our name archived."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded, silent. The bay behind them echoed with the sounds of crates being sealed, ''Meks being mothballed \
  under armed supervision. No anger. Just regulation.</p>\
  <p>"We''ll be remembered," {1} said finally.</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t look up. "The Commonwealth endures. That''s all that matters."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at the sky of {19}, still smudged with storm clouds. "Tell the techs to finish the \
  shutdown. We comply."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned, straightened {7} uniform, and walked toward the admin block - one officer in the middle of a quiet, \
  professional dismantling of the office printer.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.LA=The mess hall was empty. {0} sat alone at one \
  of the clean steel tables as the DropShip cruised at silent speed toward its designated handoff zone.\
  <p>On-screen, the order looped calmly:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "By directive of the Strategic Forces Audit Commission, your unit is hereby disbanded."<br>\
  "All operational assets are to be returned to Quartermaster General control."<br>\
  "Your banner will be archived. Your name will not."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered, set down a datapad. "Quartermaster''s team is prepped. They''ll board at the drop port. No \
  ceremony."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a slight nod. "They never wanted one."</p>\
  <p>{2} pulled off the unit patch and laid it flat on the table. "We kept the books balanced. We did our job."</p>\
  <p>"Until we were a paycheck they couldn''t justify."</p>\
  <p>{1} stood. "It''s over."</p>\
  <p>"Professionally," {10} added.</p>\
  <p>"Of course," {1} said, voice clipped. "That''s the Lyran way."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.LA=The command center still smelled of polish and ego. Marble floors. \
  Real wood trim. Blue-and-gold banners fluttering under recirculated air. {0} leaned on the ops table, \
  eyes fixed on a map that no longer mattered.\
  <p>"Dispatch came through," {9} said, walking in. "We''ve been reassigned again. This time under Baron \
  Kellersohn''s nephew. Twenty-one years old. No combat record. Promoted by marriage."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look up. "And what does he want us to do?"</p>\
  <p>"Defend an ammo depot in open terrain with two hills behind it. Classic Lyran wedge. Zero strategic value. Just \
  looks good on a map."</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled through {7} nose. "We''re not soldiers to them. We''re set pieces."</p>\
  <p>{10} folded {16} arms. "So... we''re really doing this?"</p>\
  <p>{1} straightened. "The DropShips are fueled. Our transponder will go dark two minutes into ''deployment \
  maneuvers.'' By the time the command staff realizes we''re gone, we''ll be out of atmosphere."</p>\
  <p>{10} gave a half-smile. "They''ll send a team after us. Or five."</p>\
  <p>"Let them waste the ''Meks," {1} said. "We built this unit from nothing. We kept it alive while nobles fed off our \
  kill reports. If they want it back, they can try."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks rolled to launch platforms under fake orders signed three layers up. Nothing out \
  of place. Not yet.</p>\
  <p>"You know what the newsfeeds will say," {10} said. "Traitors. Pirates. Cowards."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Let them talk. We''re not their story anymore."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.LA=The DropShip vibrated with steady engine thrust. {0} stood\
  \ on the observation deck, hands clasped behind {7} back, watching stars streak past through a thick slab of \
  reinforced glass.\
  <p>"You really hit ''send''?" {9} asked, stepping into the room.</p>\
  <p>"I did," {1} said. "Mission acknowledgment, with falsified orders from the Duke''s strategic planning office. \
  They''ll think we''re headed for a ceremonial garrison rotation."</p>\
  <p>{10} grunted. "Could''ve just sent us to play honor guard for some marble-jawed cousin of the Archon again."</p>\
  <p>"That''s the plan," {1} said. "Until we don''t show up."</p>\
  <p>{10} stared at {5}. "You''ve been patient a long time, {20}. Why now?"</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer immediately. "Because we kept getting promoted without gaining control. Because we kept \
  winning battles, but the noble houses wrote the stories. Because I looked at our kill counts and saw we weren''t \
  climbing - we were being displayed."</p>\
  <p>"And now we disappear?"</p>\
  <p>{1} turned to {14}. "No. Now we exist. For real. On our own terms."</p>\
  <p>The nav system gave a soft chime - jump alignment locked. The ship was pointed well beyond any official Steiner \
  route. No supply lines. No safety net. Just {18}, running lean and running fast.</p>\
  <p>"We''ll be branded traiters."</p>\
  <p>"That''s fine," {1} said. "We''ve already been used. Might as well be free."</p>
# Federated Suns
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.FS=The formal orders arrived at 06:00-Local, encoded and \
  authenticated. {0} read them without expression, then walked out into the pre-dawn gray of \
  {19}''s landing field. The wind bit at {7} collar.\
  <p>{9} was waiting, datapad in hand. "AFFS Logistics is inbound. They want everything inventoried before\
  \ local noon."</p>\
  <p>"We''ll give them clean tags and empty bays," {1} said. "They won''t find fault with our withdrawal."</p>\
  <p>{10} hesitated. "Command says our banners will be retired with respect."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a short breath - half scoff, half sigh. "That and two C-bills will buy you a drink."</p>\
  <p>Down the line, MekWarriors were already stepping away from their machines. No drama. No resistance. Just \
  resignation.</p>\
  <p>{1} unclipped the unit patch from {7} sleeve. "Tell them we comply. Completely."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "We''ll make sure the records show that we did our part."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at the sky. "The Davion flag still flies. That''s all that matters."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.FS=The DropShip was quiet except for the low hum of engine \
  systems and the occasional tap of boots on deck. {0} stood in the mission planning room, staring at a \
  blank holomap.\
  <p>{9} entered, holding the AFFS disbandment communiqué. "This is it," {12} said. "We''re out. Under \
  Article 14. Orders verified."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look away from the map. "We held the line when it wasn''t convenient. We carried losses others \
  wouldn''t. And now they''re done with us."</p>\
  <p>{10} placed a noteputer on the table. "Final archive of our logs. It''ll go into AFFS records. Buried, \
  probably."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a slight nod. "Let them bury it. We knew who we were."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached up, unfastened the last patch from {7} uniform, and set it gently on the console.</p>\
  <p>"It''s over," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>"And we stood to the end," {10} replied. "Even when no one else could."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.FS=The Davion sword banner flapped against the flagpole in the \
  courtyard, bold and proud under {19}''s sun. {0} stood at parade rest beside the command \
  building, boots clean, posture sharp, soul crumbling.\
  <p>"They approved it," {9} said, approaching with a data noteputer in hand. "Reassignment to Commander \
  Weiss''s battlegroup. No consultation. No briefing. Just orders."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t move. "Years. Campaigns. Seventeen letters to the families. And I get passed off like a toolkit."</p>\
  <p>{10} looked out across the landing field where {18}'' ''Meks waited under hangar shade. "It''s not just \
  you. They don''t see the unit anymore. Just stats on a rotation sheet."</p>\
  <p>"They taught us to believe in something." {1}''s voice was low. "Unity. Honor. The light of the Suns. But \
  somewhere along the line, belief turned into obedience. And I didn''t notice until it was too late."</p>\
  <p>{10} offered {5} the noteputer. {1} didn''t take it.</p>\
  <p>"Fuel''s loaded," {10} said. "JumpShip collar''s rented. Flight team''s on standby. If we don''t lift in thirty \
  minutes, it''s done."</p>\
  <p>{1} turned to face {14}. "This isn''t mutiny."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "No. It''s the only thing left to do."</p>\
  <p>Without another word, they walked toward the hangar, leaving the banner behind to ripple alone in the wind.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.FS=The DropShip ran quiet. Too quiet. {0} stood in {7} \
  quarters, looking at an old holo. Fresh uniforms. Raised swords. Bright eyes.\
  <p>"Nav computer''s ready," {9} said from the doorway. "We''re locked for the pirate point. Once we hit \
  the collar, there''s no turning around."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look up. "I thought it would feel like betrayal."</p>\
  <p>"Does it?"</p>\
  <p>"No. It feels like breathing again."</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped inside. "We were taught to follow the chain of command. That the Federated Suns were different. \
  Noble. Worth serving."</p>\
  <p>{1} finally looked at {14}. "I still believe in the people. In the soldiers. But the orders? The games behind \
  them?" {2} shook {7} head. "I can''t follow men who trade lives like bargaining chips and call it honor."</p>\
  <p>The deck trembled softly as engines warmed beneath them.</p>\
  <p>"We''ll be branded traitors," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"Then let them. We were loyal until loyalty demanded we become liars."</p>\
  <p>{2} picked up {7} sidearm, clipped it in, and walked past {10} toward the command deck.</p>\
  <p>"Let''s vanish with precision," {1} said. "Let history decide what we were."</p>

# Free Worlds League
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.FWL="Directive 27-FR/Red," {9} read aloud, \
  voice clipped. "Ratified by the Captain-General''s office, endorsed by regional governors. It''s final."\
  <p>{0} stood by the depot doors as the first trucks pulled in - logistics crews under strict orders, \
  guarded by regional troops. There would be no second chances. No appeals.</p>\
  <p>"Persistent failure to meet operational objectives," {10} added. "Discipline breakdowns. Cost-to-performance \
  ratio..."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t reply. {2} was watching the technicians tag their equipment - ''Meks, munitions, even spare actuators. \
  Everything catalogued. Everything logged. The League loved its paperwork.</p>\
  <p>"We''re not even a line item anymore," {10} said quietly.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned, pulled the velcro patch from [7] arm, and set it on the nearest crate. "No. We''re surplus."</p>\
  <p>And with that, {18} became history - filed, boxed, and forgotten.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.FWL=The cabin lights were dimmed. {0} sat at the \
  table in the crew lounge, staring at the official dissolution packet glowing on the wall display.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Directive 27-FR/Red... your unit is disbanded."<br>\
  "Performance unsustainable. Command instability."<br>\
  "The League endures. Your unit does not."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered quietly, a datafile in hand. "Depot rendezvous in sixteen hours. We hand off all \
  hardware. No exceptions."</p>\
  <p>"And the personnel?" {1} asked, voice low.</p>\
  <p>"Reassigned or dismissed based on reviews. Morale''s... frayed."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "This is what failure looks like, in the League. Not a court-martial. A memo."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into a storage drawer and pulled out the last unit insignia, slid it across the table.</p>\
  <p>{10} picked it up. "You want this logged or buried?"</p>\
  <p>"Burn it," {1} said. "They''ve already erased us from their books."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.FWL={0} sat at the comms console in the base office, reading\
  \ the latest missive for the fourth time. Six seals across the header - each from a different provincial government, \
  all contradicting each other.\
  <p>"New orders?" {9} asked, stepping through the doorway with a grimace already forming.</p>\
  <p>{1} slid the noteputer across. "Depends which version you believe. One says we deploy to the Magistracy front. \
  Another says we hold position until the Duchy of Oriente confirms funding. A third wants us to report to a command \
  that hasn''t existed for thirty years."</p>\
  <p>{10} stared at it. "That''s not just confusion. That''s deliberate sabotage."</p>\
  <p>"And we''re the ones who bleed for it." {1} stood. "I checked the logs. They haven''t paid our support crews in \
  weeks. Ammo rationed. Ration packs expired. And they''re too busy arguing over political optics to notice."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks were being prepped under the guise of a training op. Everything neat. Efficient. \
  Just like always.</p>\
  <p>{10}''s voice dropped. "So what''s the call?"</p>\
  <p>{1} looked {14} in the eye. "We disappear. No broadcast. No manifesto. Let the League try to explain how they \
  lost a fully operational unit without even firing a shot."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded slowly. "And when they come looking?"</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled bitterly. "They''ll have to agree on whose jurisdiction we were under first."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.FWL=The DropShip hummed with power as it cruised away from League \
  space. {0} stood on the observation deck, a crystal glass of League-brand brandy in hand - untouched.\
  <p>"Still not drinking?" {9} asked as {12} entered.</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "Reminds me too much of the people who toasted every time they sacrificed us."</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned on the railing. "Three provinces filed conflicting claims on us last week. I read the intelligence \
  brief. They''re still arguing about who gets to write our obituaries."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t laugh. "Let them. Maybe by the time they finish, we''ll be out of reach."</p>\
  <p>{10} studied {5}. "You''re not angry."</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled. "I was. For years. At the House Marik game of leverage and silence. At being passed around like a \
  political asset. But now?" {2} looked at the stars. "Now I just feel... done."</p>\
  <p>The nav light pulsed amber. A long jump queued - destination redacted. The ship wouldn''t ping IFF again. Not \
  unless they chose to.</p>\
  <p>"There''s no flag waiting for us," {10} said. "No anthem. No safe harbor."</p>\
  <p>{1} turned to {14}. "Then we build our own. No more leagues. No more lies."</p>

# Terran Hegemony
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.TH=The deactivation command hit every terminal on base at \
  00:00-Local. {0} stood beneath the sensor tower, eyes fixed on the base chronometer as the status bars \
  all flipped red. The shutdown had begun.\
  <p>{9} approached from the barracks, clipboard tucked under one arm. "It''s official. Strategic Review \
  Protocol 9-Collapse. Effective immediately."</p>\
  <p>"Logistics confirmed?" {1} asked.</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "They''ve already reassigned our hangar space. No delay. No discussion."</p>\
  <p>The MekBay lights were cycling down - one by one, standby power cut. Subsystems locked out. Sentries offline.</p>\
  <p>"They evaluated us into extinction," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t argue. "Your logbook''s being archived under classified review."</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled the patch from {7} jacket. "No trial. No report. Just a protocol."</p>\
  <p>"And no further correspondence will be issued," {10} recited. The system had spoken. There would be no echo.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.TH=The ship''s command terminal displayed the final review \
  order in grayscale. {0} sat motionless as it cycled through the closure checklist:\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit: {18}."<br>\
  "Directive: Strategic Review Protocol 9-Collapse."<br>\
  "Status: Dissolved."<br>\
  "Historical logbook: Archived - Classified Access."<br>\
  "Future correspondence: None."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} stepped onto the bridge. "Inventory purge complete. Logistics confirms reabsorption of all \
  digital assets. They''re already issuing our gear to new commands."</p>\
  <p>"No citation. No commendation," {1} said. "Just erased."</p>\
  <p>{10} handed {5} a noteputer. "Local copy of our full mission history. Technically illegal."</p>\
  <p>{1} accepted it without a word. {2} stood, placed the unit insignia on the command panel, and let the ship lights\
  \ dim around them.</p>\
  <p>"They ended our story with a database flag," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>"We still have the memories," {10} replied.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look back. The silence lingered around {7} neck like a noose.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.TH=The Terran Hegemony emblem hung above the command post entrance. \
  Spotlights lit it like scripture. {0} stood in the doorway, helmet under one arm, jaw clenched.\
  <p>"Transmission just came in," {9} said, stepping across the ferrocrete. "Order confirms redeployment. \
  No rationale. No briefing. No support elements."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded once. "Typical."</p>\
  <p>{10} glanced toward the ''Mek bay. "They still talk about unity like it''s a law of physics. Like the Hegemony just\
  \ <i>is</i>, and the rest of us are supposed to follow gravitational pull."</p>\
  <p>"We were trained to believe it," {1} said. "That we were chosen. That order was better than freedom. That \
  precision mattered more than pain."</p>\
  <p>"And now?"</p>\
  <p>{1} turned. "Now I see the gears grind people just as easily as they move armies."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks ran silent checks. Ammunition topped. Codebooks scrubbed. They were ghosting \
  out.</p>\
  <p>{10}''s voice dropped. "They''ll call us rebels. Anomalies. Defects in the system."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked back at the banner. "Then let them. I''d rather be a flaw in the machine than a cog in its lies."</p>\
  <p>They walked away from the seal of Terra and into a war of their own choosing.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.TH=The DropShip whispered through deep space, hull lights dimmed, power\
  \ draw masked. {0} stood near the nav computer, where the jump plot glowed - off-grid, illegal, \
  perfect.</p>\
  <p>"Last auto-ping back just failed to send," {9} said, walking in. "Signal repeater''s been \
  ''malfunctioning'' for ten minutes now."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t respond right away. {2} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} watching old training footage - Hegemony academies,\
  \ parades, speeches about order, progress, destiny.</p>\
  <p>"They promised us clarity," {1} said. "And gave us obedience."</p>\
  <p>{10} crossed {16} arms. "I think they believed their own message."</p>\
  <p>"They did. That makes it worse."</p>\
  <p>The nav screen flickered - course confirmed, two jumps beyond Hegemony surveillance radius. Out there was nothing \
  but the raw idea of freedom.</p>\
  <p>{10} hesitated. "What happens when they find us?"</p>\
  <p>"They''ll find people who stopped playing along."</p>\
  <p>{1} reached up, killed the nav recording logs, and whispered, "Tell the Captain to jump."</p>\
  <p>{18} disappeared - no manifesto, no explanation, just silence in the face of empire.</p>
# Republic of the Sphere
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.ROS=The wind blew dust across the compound''s parade \
  ground, rustling the edge of the Republic banner where it still hung. {0} stood in the center of the \
  staging platform, datapad in hand. The official transmission blinked quietly:\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Your unit is to be officially disbanded, effective immediately."<br>\
  "Unacceptable casualty ratios. Operational collapse. Report for reassignment."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} approached, reading the same orders on {16} own screen. "Oversight Council reviewed our last six \
  ops. Says our breakdowns jeopardized allied cohesion."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "So we''re the cost of their course correction."</p>\
  <p>Behind them, techs began disengaging gear from the ''Meks. A surgical dismantling. No shouting. No ceremony.</p>\
  <p>"They expect orderly dissolution," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll get it," {1} replied. "Just don''t expect a speech."</p>\
  <p>{2} removed {18} insignia from {7} collar and dropped it into the equipment bin without a glance. The\
  \ Republic endured - but not everyone was invited to serve.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.ROS=The crew lounge was dark but functional. {0} \
  sat at a side table, fingers steepled under {7} chin. A holo projected the Republic''s final ruling in front of \
  {5}.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "All personnel will be reassigned. All military hardware is to be returned."<br>\
  "The Republic survives not by holding on to the broken."<br>\
  "Assist in an orderly dissolution."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} stood beside the galley counter. "Our gear''s been tagged for surrender at the next transit hub. \
  Command says we''ll be given favorable placements."</p>\
  <p>{1} tilted {7} head slightly. "We were assets. Now we''re components to redistribute."</p>\
  <p>"The Republic survives," {10} said softly.</p>\
  <p>{1} reached into {7} coat and pulled free the last fabric version of their unit insignia. {2} didn''t say anything\
  \ - just folded it twice and set it down on the table.</p>\
  <p>"It survives," {1} echoed. "But we won''t be there to see it."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.ROS=The command terminal blinked in green harmony. Republic seal. \
  Clean font. Language polished for unity. {0} stared at the words like they were written in a dead \
  tongue.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered quietly. "Orders came in. We''re being transferred. Again."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look up. "What is it this time?"</p>\
  <p>"Stability patrol. Minor unrest. They want us visible. Non-lethal presence."</p>\
  <p>"Visible to who?" {1}''s voice was soft. "To make locals feel safe, or to remind them who''s in charge?"</p>\
  <p>{10} hesitated. "The message doesn''t say."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks powered down like museum pieces - symbols of the old ways, now wrapped in Republic \
  propaganda. They weren''t warriors anymore. They were deterrents with legs.</p>\
  <p>{1} stood slowly. "Fuel''s loaded?"</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "Manifest''s scrubbed. Communications ghosted. We''re dark in fifteen."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll call us dangerous. Extremists. Traitors to peace."</p>\
  <p>"Maybe we are," {10} said. "But not to the people under our command."</p>\
  <p>{1} allowed a breath. Then {3} moved. No salute. No ceremony. Just silence and decision, stepping off the \
  Republic''s stage into something real.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.ROS=The DropShip moved silently towards the pirate point. No IFF. No \
  ping. A ghost ship carrying soldiers who had stopped believing in the system they helped enforce.\
  <p>{0} stood at the central terminal, watching the encryption overlays peel away - one after another, like \
  the Republic''s promises.</p>\
  <p>{9} stepped in. "Republic CommandNet hasn''t tracked our deviation yet. They still think we''re inbound to \
  the nadir."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They''ll figure it out eventually. But by then we''ll be gone."</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned against the bulkhead. "Do you think the Exarch ever believed it could work?"</p>\
  <p>"I think they wanted to," {1} said. "But peace isn''t something you issue from Terra. Not when the galaxy still \
  remembers who bled for it."</p>\
  <p>The nav computer flashed green - custom jump route authorized, buried under corrupted courier files. Clean getaway, \
  if the system didn''t glitch.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll spin it," {10} said. "Make us the warning. The fracture. Another reason to tighten control."</p>\
  <p>"Let them," {1} replied. "They can write whatever history they want. We''ll be living the truth they refused to \
  see."</p>\
  <p>The ship shifted into final burn. {18} weren''t coming back. Not to the Republic. Not to the lie of \
  enforced peace. Only forward.</p>
# Star League
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.SL=The final order was delivered on an SLDF-secured \
  channel. No commentary. No apology. Just protocol.\
  <p>{0} stood on the drill field as logistics personnel began their sweep through the motor pool. \
  Everything was tagged for reclamation: vehicles, ''Meks, even uniforms.</p>\
  <p>{9} stood beside {5}, formal posture, voice neutral. "Protocol 5-Bravo. We''ve been deactivated."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They archived our designation?"</p>\
  <p>{10} checked {16} pad. "Stricken from the rolls. Combat ineffectiveness. Doctrinal deviation. Leadership \
  failure."</p>\
  <p>The SLDF didn''t just remove. It erased.</p>\
  <p>{1} peeled the unit patch from {7} jacket, staring at the faded insignia. "So that''s how it ends."</p>\
  <p>{10} responded with the only thing that mattered. "Service noted. Record ends now."</p>\
  <p>{18} were no longer soldiers. They were just statistics waiting for consolidation.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.SL=The command deck of the DropShip was quiet. The order \
  had come through encrypted, impersonal, absolute.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit designation ''{18}'' is to be deactivated and dissolved under Protocol 5-Bravo."<br>\
  "All ''Meks, supplies, and command assets are to be surrendered for redistribution."<br>\
  "Your service is noted. This record ends now."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stared at the screen for a long time. {9} entered, voice level. "Personnel have been \
  reassigned. Our ''Meks are being prepped for handover."</p>\
  <p>"No hearings?" {1} asked.</p>\
  <p>"No. Not even an audit. The logbook''s going to classified storage."</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled off {7} unit insignia. "We did everything by the book."</p>\
  <p>"And the book has no space left for us."</p>\
  <p>{1} placed the insignia on the center table. Not out of reverence. Just to leave something behind.</p>\
  <p>"SLDF erasure," {3} said. "Efficient as ever."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.SL=The barracks on {19} were immaculate - standard-issue to \
  SLDF specs. Every rivet uniform. Every step echoing the perfection of a system that prided itself on unity. \
  {0} stared at the order noteputer. No facial expression. Just stillness.\
  <p>{9} stood by the entrance, clipboard under one arm. "I verified the signal. It''s official. Direct from \
  Unity City. They want us off-world within twenty-four hours. New operation. No briefing. No appeal."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up. "They don''t explain anymore. Just assign."</p>\
  <p>{10} took a breath. "SLDF doesn''t question. We execute. That''s the oath."</p>\
  <p>"I remember." {1} paused. "I also remember when they treated us like people, not numbers on a deployment grid."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks were being loaded onto DropShips under a false training manifest. The logistics \
  officers had signed off, assuming it was part of a black operation. It wasn''t. Not officially.</p>\
  <p>{10}''s voice dropped. "They''ll send the Internal Oversight Division. No trial. Just classification."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Let them. They''ll never say why we left. Just that we did. And someone, somewhere, will wonder what\
  \ happened."</p>\
  <p>They stepped into the lift. No fanfare. No protest. Just two officers walking away from the most powerful \
  military in human history - because even the brightest empires cast shadows.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.SL=The DropShip cruised silently on low burn. Within its sealed command \
  deck, the icon of the Star League gleamed on every console - proud, perfect, inescapable.\
  <p>{0} sat alone at the nav computer until {9} joined {5}, slow and careful.</p>\
  <p>"Final burn to jump point locked in," {10} said. "All systems spoofed. Our ID tags say we''re in drydock."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t respond right away. {2} {17, choice, 0#was|1#were} staring at a still image - the First Lord, smiling. \
  Hope made flesh.</p>\
  <p>"They trained us to believe in something flawless," {1} said. "But no system''s perfect. Not even this one."</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned on the console. "What we''re doing... they''ll erase us. No court. No history. Just silence."</p>\
  <p>"Then let them. This isn''t a statement. It''s a refusal."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the JumpShip hummed beneath. The ship was seconds from slipping off the grid, beyond recovery.</p>\
  <p>{10} exhaled. "You think they''ll learn from this?"</p>\
  <p>{1} finally stood. "No. But maybe someone will remember we were here."</p>\
  <p>They jumped - not into exile, not into glory - but into a blank page no one in Unity City ever planned to write on.</p>

# Federated Commonwealth
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.FC=The message came via a triple-authenticated comm burst \
  - high clearance, high formality. {0} stood by the forward observation wall, listening to the playback.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Pursuant to Operation Sunset Protocol, your unit is hereby deactivated and dissolved, effective immediately."<br>\
  "Persistent failure. Loss of strategic value. Deterioration in command stability."<br>\

  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered, datapad in hand. "Quartermaster transport is inbound. They''ve already logged our entire \

  <p>{1} didn''t turn. "And the personnel?"</p>\
  <p>"Reassignment orders filed for half. Other half gets cut loose."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They always did talk about rebuilding stronger."</p>\
  <p>{10} walked to the center of the room and placed a box on the table - {18}'' regimental insignia \
  inside, sealed in glass.</p>\
  <p>And outside, the ''Meks powered down for the last time.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.FC=The DropShip floated in a system-neutral drift, waiting \
  for landing clearance at a secure FedCom depot.\
  <p>{0} sat in the mission chair as the final order played again across the console screen.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Operation Sunset Protocol. Your unit has been deemed unviable."<br>\
  "All materiel is to be surrendered to Quartermaster Command. Personnel to report for reassignment."<br>\
  "Your banner will be archived, but it will not fly again."\

  <p>{9} entered, setting a sealed archive container on the console. "Our final report''s in. They won''t \
  challenge it."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked down at the empty insignia patch on {7} sleeve. "No one fights for the archive."</p>\
  <p>"We don''t need to," {10} replied. "We served. It''s done."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded slowly. "Then let the history books decide if we mattered."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.FC=The two flags hung side by side - gold Davion sunburst and blue \
  Steiner fist. {0} stared at them from across the briefing room, posture rigid, teeth clenched behind calm\
  \ words.</p>\
  <p>"Command structure''s changed again," {9} said, sliding a data pad across the table. "Lyran logistics,\
  \ Davion doctrine. New CO''s from New Avalon, reporting to Tharkad command."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t pick it up. "Every month, a different voice. A different plan. And we''re supposed to pretend it''s one\
  \ army."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded toward the bay windows. Outside, {18}'' ''Meks stood prepped - heat purged, engines primed, \
  ready for a deployment that wouldn''t happen.</p>\
  <p>"People still believe in this merger," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"Because they haven''t bled for both sides," {1} replied.</p>\
  <p>{2} stood, calm and precise. "We''re lifting in ten. Transponder''s spoofed. They''ll think we''re heading to \
  reinforce the northern front."</p>\
  <p>{10}''s voice dropped. "And when they realize we''re not?"</p>\
  <p>"They''ll blame each other first. That''ll buy us time."</p>\
  <p>The FedCom was built on unity. But {1} had seen the fault lines up close. {6} decision wouldn''t break the \
  alliance - but it would prove it was already breaking itself.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.FC=The DropShip cruised through space, its logs marked as a standard \
  FedCom logistics ferry - on paper, nothing unusual. {0} stood at the command console, watching a tactical \
  map flicker between Davion green and Steiner blue.\
  <p>"The Captain reports jump calibration complete," {9} said, entering. "We''re two hours from scheduled \
  check-in. Still ghosted."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded slowly. "If they don''t see us, they can''t ask questions."</p>\
  <p>"We had a good slot in the command rotation," {10} said. "We could''ve ridden it out. Made rank. Pushed \
  paperwork until we got fat."</p>\
  <p>{1} turned. "You ever fight under Steiner op tempo and Davion logistics at the same time?"</p>\
  <p>{10} gave a bitter laugh. "I have the ulcers to prove it."</p>\
  <p>"They don''t want a unified army," {1} said. "They want the <i>appearance</i> of one. Until it''s inconvenient."</p>\
  <p>The nav screen flickered - new trajectory set. Outside FedCom territory. No landing rights. No diplomatic cover. \
  Just drift and choice.</p>\
  <p>"And now?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>"Now we become the thing they say doesn''t exist," {1} replied. "A soldier who says no."</p>\
  <p>They stood in silence as the ship accelerated, leaving the banners of both Great Houses behind.</p>

# Periphery
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.periphery=The shutdown order was short. Brutal. Delivered \
  over an unsecured channel.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "No salvage. No cohesion. No victories."<br>\
  "We don''t have the resources to prop up broken units."<br>\
  "Your flag comes down today."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood outside the bunkhouse as the message echoed from every loudspeaker on base. Around {5}, \
  soldiers moved slowly, confused but not surprised.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached, hauling a crate of sealed weapons. "They''re not even coming to pick it up. Just said \
  to leave it stacked for redistribution."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Or scavengers."</p>\
  <p>The unit''s banner had already been pulled down and folded into a supply bag. It would not be hoisted again.</p>\
  <p>"They didn''t even say ''thank you,''" {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>"They don''t have to," {1} replied. "They said, "you''re done" and that''s all they meant."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.periphery=The display terminal was cracked. The \
  transmission quality degraded. But the message had gotten through:\
  <blockquote><p><em>\

  "We don''t owe you a second chance."<br>\
  "Your flag comes down today."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat in the auxiliary bay, watching techs prepare their last functioning ''Mek for mothballing.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered, shaking {16} head. "The rest of the crew''s been offered open contracts or a fast ride \
  off-world. No one''s waiting for orders."</p>\
  <p>"Because there aren''t any," {1} said flatly. "We''ve been written off."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into a side pouch and withdrew their old insignia patch - creased, cracked, soaked with coolant \
  stains.</p>\
  <p>{2} screwed it up and dropped it into the ship''s incinerator chute. A final, pointless act of defiance.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.periphery=The outpost was little more than prefab walls and stubborn \
  welds. Dust swept in under the doorframe, same as always. {0} leaned over a crate-turned-table, the \
  mission console flickering in front of {5}. The orders weren''t even signed.\
  <p>{9} stood by the door, arms crossed. "I checked. Same deal. No support. No reason. Just ''handle \
  it.''"</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look up. "They''re assuming we''ll obey."</p>\
  <p>"Because we always do."</p>\
  <p>{1} killed the console. "Not this time."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the ''Meks were already warming. No fuss. No lights. Just readiness like a held breath.</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped forward. "They''ll call it mutiny."</p>\
  <p>"Then they weren''t listening," {1} said. "We didn''t turn on them. They turned away from us."</p>\
  <p>They stepped into the wind without ceremony. No ranks. No flag. Just the weight of what they were choosing - and \
  the freedom of doing it anyway.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.periphery=The DropShip creaked more than it hummed. Half its panels \
  were mismatched. A few still had the old militia stenciling faded beneath newer paint. {0} sat in the \
  cramped galley, nursing coffee that tasted like rust and resolve.\
  <p>{9} dropped into the opposite seat. "Captain says the jump drive''s ready."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out the viewport. "We were supposed to be better than this."</p>\
  <p>"We were. That''s why we''re leaving."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded slowly. "I thought staying loyal was the only thing that made us different."</p>\
  <p>"Turns out it was the lie that made it possible."</p>\
  <p>The ship shuddered as the nav computer locked. No fanfare. Just motion.</p>\
  <p>{10} stood. "They''ll say we quit. Mutinied. Cut and run."</p>\
  <p>{1} finished the coffee, stood with {14}. "Let them. We know what we didn''t become."</p>\
  <p>They walked together down the hall, toward the bridge. No flag flew on the hull. No orders blinked on the screen. \
  Just space. And choice.</p>

# Rim Worlds Republic

  "There will be no ceremony. You''re not worthy of the honor."\

  <p>{9} stood near the armory doors. "They''ve divided the roster. Command officers are flagged for \
  detainment."</p>\
  <p>"Expected," {1} muttered. "It was never about performance. Just control."</p>\
  <p>{2} looked down at {7} hands - callused from years of service.</p>\
  <p>{10} offered nothing. No comfort. Just facts. "This is a purge. And we''re lucky we got this far."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded, removed the unit insignia from {7} collar, and dropped it into a waste bin already full of rank pins\
  \ and shredded patches. The Republic didn''t want soldiers. It wanted obedience.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.RWR=The deactivation notice was already cycling on the wall\
  \ screen when {0} stepped into the forward corridor.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "As of this transmission, your unit is disbanded by order of the High Military Directorate."<br>\
  "Surviving officers will be reassigned or detained based on loyalty assessments."<br>\
  "There will be no ceremony."<br>\
  "You''re not worthy of the honor."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} leaned against the wall, arms folded. "Loyalty scan packets went out three hours ago. We''re all \
  flagged as compromised."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t flinch. "So this was never about fixing anything."</p>\
  <p>"Just pruning the tree."</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled the unit patch from {7} jacket and dropped it into the recycler. "No point holding onto symbols \
  they''ve already burned."</p>\
  <p>The ship drifted. {18} weren''t being reassigned - they were being buried.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.RWR=The Rim Worlds banner hung limp on the drill yard wall. Its \
  shark-insignia glared across the concrete. {0} stood beneath it, helmet under arm, flanked by silence.\
  <p>"Orders came in," {9} said, stepping into the shadow of the overhang. "Another transfer. Another \
  purge. Quiet ones this time. No paperwork. Just disappearances."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t speak for a long time. Then: "They''re getting bolder."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "Word is, the CO wants a ''loyal core'' - units that answer to her, not the council. We''re not on \
  that list."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks were loading onto transports. No insignia. No manifest. Just motion and \
  momentum.</p>\
  <p>"You sure?" {10} asked, voice low. "We step off this base, we''re not Rim Worlds anymore. Not anything."</p>\
  <p>{1} turned toward the open hangar. "We were never anything to them. Just uniforms with lungs. Easier to replace \
  than question."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll hunt us."</p>\
  <p>"Let them. Better than becoming what they''re building."</p>\
  <p>They left the serpent banner flapping alone in the wind. Forgotten. Like they intended to be.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.RWR=The DropShip coasted through the black, its identity wiped, \
  transponder silent. {0} sat alone in the upper observatory, watching the flickering trail of stars and \
  wondering which one would see them buried.\
  <p>{9} entered, quiet as always. "We''ve cleared the patrol net. Three days to the next jump point. \
  Fuel''s tight but viable."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look away from the viewport. "Any signal from the Republic?"</p>\
  <p>{10} shook {16} head. "Not yet. But when they realize we''re gone, it won''t take long."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They thought loyalty meant silence. That we''d stay in uniform no matter what they asked of us."</p>\
  <p>{10} hesitated. "We were loyal. Until they turned it into worship."</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled bitterly. The nav screen blinked: unregistered jump plotted. Outside the Republic''s grip. Outside \
  anyone''s.</p>\
  <p>"No return route?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} stood. "No future in that direction."</p>\
  <p>Engines pulsed. Lights dimmed. {18} became ghosts in a war that hadn''t started publicly - but had \
  already killed them on paper.</p>
# Taurian Concordat
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.TC=The order came in via hardline: brief, direct, and \
  absolute.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "By order of the TDF Strategic Reorganization Office, your unit is disbanded, effective immediately."<br>\
  "Sustained underperformance. Command breakdowns. Morale incompatible with Taurian standards."<br>\
  "No ceremony will be held. Your banner will be archived. Let history judge the rest."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the motor pool as the unit''s banner was removed from the wall and folded into storage. No\
  \ speeches. Just quiet movements and clipped commands.</p>\
  <p>{9} reported in. "Quartermaster lists confirmed. Personnel routed to regional HQs. Equipment''s being \
  loaded for turnover."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t respond. {2} was watching the last ''Mek get powered down, cockpit open and exposed - like a carcass \
  waiting for parts to be stripped.</p>\
  <p>"They expect us to vanish without noise," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"We will," {1} replied. "That''s what''s expected."</p>\
  <p>And that was all the TDF needed to hear.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.TC=The order played once and then locked itself from \
  playback - standard Taurian protocol. No point in hearing it again.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit disbanded."<br>\
  "Assets surrendered."<br>\
  "Banner archived."<br>\
  "Let history judge the rest."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat at a narrow galley table, watching empty seats around {5}. The rest of the crew had either \
  been reassigned or chosen to leave before they were ordered to.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered with the last of the data backups. "They''ve voided our contracts. No retention bonus. No \
  pension review."</p>\
  <p>{1} offered a flat smile. "Efficiency. A Taurian virtue."</p>\
  <p>{2} placed the final patch - frayed, sun-bleached - into a disposable bag. "We''ll be a footnote in a logbook \
  somewhere."</p>\
  <p>{10} shrugged. "At least they didn''t lie about it."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.TC=The Taurian bull emblem was carved into the wall behind {0}\
  \ - deep, deliberate, and covered in dust. The base was old, but solid. Like the Concordat itself.\
  <p>{9} stepped into the command room and closed the door behind {5}. "Last supply truck rolled out. \
  Manifest doctored. We''re clear."</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled. "It feels like betrayal."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the ''Meks were warming up under quiet power. No drills. No fanfare. Just quiet preparation.</p>\
  <p>{10} kept {16} voice low. "The Concordat''s small. They''ll notice. And they don''t forgive easy."</p>\
  <p>{1} finally turned. "They raised us on independence. On speaking truth, even when no one wanted to hear it. \
  That''s what I''m doing now."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll say we''re traitors."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Then they''d be right."</p>\
  <p>{2} took one last look at the bull crest before walking out. {2} didn''t salute it. {2} didn''t have the right.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.TC=The DropShip drifted silent towards the pirate point, its transponder \
  scrubbed, its signal dead. {0} sat in the forward gallery, staring out at nothing. The stars didn''t \
  judge {5}. The Concordat might.\
  <p>{9} arrived, carrying a flask. {11} held it out.</p>\
  <p>{1} took it. Didn''t drink. Just held it for a long moment.</p>\
  <p>"We ever talk about what we''d do if the Concordat lost its way?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "We said we''d speak up. Stay true. Raise hell if we had to."</p>\
  <p>"We didn''t say we''d walk."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked back at {14}. "No. Because none of us thought we''d have to."</p>\
  <p>The nav computer pinged - course locked. Nowhere official. Nowhere safe. But at least it was theirs.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll never believe we did it for the right reasons," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"They don''t have to," {1} replied. "We didn''t leave because we stopped loving this place. We left because we \
  still do."</p>\
  <p>The flask stayed on the table between them - shared, untouched, symbolic. A parting toast to a homeland that \
  wouldn''t understand.</p>

# Magistracy of Canopus
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.MOC=The order was clear, calm, and final.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "By order of the Strategic Readiness Council, your unit is dissolved and removed from the active roster of the \
  Magistracy Armed Forces."<br>\
  "This decision reflects a prolonged record of underperformance, logistical dysfunction, and failure to meet \
  readiness standards."<br>\
  "May it serve as a reminder - not of failure, but of the consequences of failing to adapt."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} watched the comms screen go dark, then lowered the datapad with deliberate care. Outside, support \
  staff were already loading the last equipment into lock crates.</p>\
  <p>{9} walked across the hangar floor. "They''re not angry. They''re just... done with us."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Evolution is policy. We didn''t keep up."</p>\
  <p>{10} gestured to the storage bay, where the unit banner was being carefully folded - not burned, not torn. \
  Archived.</p>\
  <p>"At least they gave us a footnote," {1} said. "Could''ve been worse."</p>\
  <p>"Could''ve been silence," {10} agreed.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.MOC=The mission terminal displayed the official notice in \
  its signature Canopian formatting - concise, dignified, irrefutable.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Dissolution effective immediately."<br>\
  "Performance metrics unmet. Readiness standards breached."<br>\
  "Let the record serve as a reminder to all commands."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat beside the forward console. {9} entered with a small, sealed case - the last \
  logbook, physical and encrypted.</p>\
  <p>"Their tone was almost polite," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"It''s the Magistracy," {1} replied. "We''re not Taurians."</p>\
  <p>{2} pulled off the last insignia on {7} sleeve and tucked it into the case. "Our relevance expired."</p>\
  <p>"But not our record," {10} said. "They''ll remember us."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a quiet nod. "That''s more than some get."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.MOC=The Magistracy flag danced in the garden breeze - bright greens and \
  golds, defiant against the dry heat. {0} stood by the arched walkway overlooking the barracks. The place \
  was beautiful. And that made it harder.\
  <p>{9} approached slowly. "Transmission''s been looped. Command thinks we''re still here. Long enough to \
  finish prep."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer. Just stared at the flag. "They always said the Magistracy was a paradise."</p>\
  <p>"It is. Until you ask the wrong question."</p>\
  <p>{1} glanced back. "They told us we were free. But they never said free to choose."</p>\
  <p>"MIM will bury this," {10} said. "They''ll say we cracked. Drugs. Strain. Anything but truth."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks gleamed under solar panels, repainted clean. Not Magistracy green. Something \
  neutral. Something new.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned. "Fuel up. No comms. No last words. We vanish without drama. Let them guess why."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll call it desertion."</p>\
  <p>"Let them. The Magistracy taught me how to choose."</p>\
  <p>{2} stepped past the orchids, away from the nation that raised {5}. The garden kept blooming, like nothing had \
  changed.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.MOC=The DropShip moved quiet and elegant through deep space, its hull \
  trimmed in gold leaf. {0} sat alone in the lounge, staring into a crystal glass of Canopian liqueur, \
  untouched.\
  <p>{9} entered without speaking. {11} closed the door behind {14} - softly, out of respect more than \
  secrecy.</p>\
  <p>"We''ve cleared broadcast range," {12} said. "No pings. Nav''s locked two jumps beyond border."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "And MIM?"</p>\
  <p>{10} shook {16} head. "No sign. Doesn''t mean they''re not watching. Just means we haven''t made them blink \
  yet."</p>\
  <p>{1} leaned back. "They offered us everything. Comfort. Autonomy. Love, if you played it right."</p>\
  <p>"But not truth."</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled sadly. "No. That was rationed. Controlled like oxygen."</p>\
  <p>The nav computer lit green - course confirmed. The ship vibrated as its drive engaged.</p>\
  <p>"We''ll be hunted," {10} said. "But quietly. Beautifully. Like an assassination in a ballroom."</p>\
  <p>{1} stood, leaving the drink untouched. "Let them come. If they taught me anything, it''s how to wear a smile \
  while planning an escape."</p>\
  <p>{18} left the Magistracy not in rage, but in quiet refusal. The kind that says: you can''t keep what\
  \ won''t stay.></p>

# Outworlds Alliance
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.OA=The message was unsigned, but unmistakably official.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Your unit is formally deactivated and removed from the Alliance Military Corps registry."<br>\
  "This action is taken due to consistent underperformance, command instability, and deteriorating operational \
  capacity."<br>\
  "This unit''s service is acknowledged. Its conduct must not be repeated."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the central yard, boots coated in dust, watching supply clerks seal up crates of gear for \
  collection. Nothing dramatic. Just quiet bureaucracy.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached with a personnel noteputer. "They''ve processed us. Half the unit''s already reassigned. The\
  \ rest are... on their own."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a shallow nod. "They won''t make a speech. But we were still theirs once."</p>\
  <p>{10} looked down. "They expected better."</p>\
  <p>"So did I," {1} said. And turned away before the silence could answer back.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.OA=The nav computer still showed their old Alliance routes,\
  \ but the overlay was grayed out now. Redacted. Deauthorized.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "As of this moment, your unit is deactivated and removed from the Alliance Military Corps registry."<br>\
  "Operational capacity no longer meets minimum requirements."<br>\
  "This unit''s service is acknowledged. Its conduct must not be repeated."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat quietly beside the systems console. {9} entered with a soft footfall, holding the \
  last filed report in {7} hands.</p>\
  <p>"We weren''t the worst," {10} said. "Just... no longer useful."</p>\
  <p>{1} took the report and placed it into the archive bin.</p>\
  <p>{10} sat beside {5}. "Could be worse."</p>\
  <p>"Could be easier," {1} said.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.OA=The hangar was quiet, even for the Alliance. No alarms. No barking \
  officers. Just the low hum of repair gantries and a soft wind coming through the open doors. {0} stood \
  alone by a ''Mek, helmet dangling at {7} side.\
  <p>{9} walked up behind {5}. "Cargo''s loaded. Nobody asked why. Probably don''t want to know."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t turn. "This place was supposed to be different. Honest. Human."</p>\
  <p>"It still is," {10} said. "But it''s small. And scared. And not built for what''s coming."</p>\
  <p>{1} finally looked over {7} shoulder. "So we leave?"</p>\
  <p>"We choose."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18} stood ready - but not proud. They looked like tools, not soldiers. That was always the \
  Alliance way: practical. Modest. Quietly brave.</p>\
  <p>"They won''t stop us," {10} said. "But they''ll mourn it. Quietly. Like everything else."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Then let''s go before they have time to beg us to stay."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.OA=The DropShip ran on minimal power, drifting between stars without a \
  course broadcast. {0} sat on the mess deck, turning a ceramic mug in {7} hands. It was plain. No unit \
  patch. No slogan. Just white.\
  <p>{9} entered, closing the bulkhead behind {14} with a soft click. "Auto-ping''s been scrubbed. No signal\
  \ back to Command. No log entry."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look up. "No accusations either."</p>\
  <p>{10} shook {16} head. "They won''t chase us. That''s not their way."</p>\
  <p>"I know," {1} said. "That''s why it hurts more."</p>\
  <p>Outside, space stretched forever - wide, clean, and cold. Somewhere, the Alliance would keep going. Trying to be \
  decent in a galaxy that doesn''t reward decency.</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned against the wall. "Do you think they''ll understand?"</p>\
  <p>{1} finally looked at {14}. "No. But I think they''ll forgive us anyway."</p>\
  <p>And that was the last word. They left without glory, without enemies, and without home - only conviction, and the \
  long quiet between stars.</p>

# Marian Hegemony
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.MH=The order was carved into the official communiqué with \
  the severity of a death sentence.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Effective this day, by command of the Caesar and with the authority of the Supreme Legate, {18} is \
  disbanded."<br>\
  "Repeated failures in combat readiness, strategic execution, and morale preservation have rendered this legion \
  unfit for continued service."<br>\
  "You will not march again under our banner."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood rigid in the center of the courtyard as Legion auditors marked off crates and locked down \
  hangars. No troops saluted. No flags flew. Not anymore.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached, {16} voice flat. "Disarmament complete. Personnel reassignment begins within the hour.\
  \ Officers reviewed for potential conscription - or dismissal."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out over the field. "They said the Republic remembers its champions... and its failures."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded grimly. "Today we''re the latter."</p>\
  <p>{1} unclipped the unit insignia and dropped it into the mud. No one picked it up.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.MH=The message was short. Brutal. Final.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "You are disbanded."<br>\
  "You will not march again."<br>\
  "The Republic remembers its champions - and its failures."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stared at the transmission log. No appeals. No protocol. Just exile.</p>\
  <p>{9} sat nearby, clipboard resting on the bench beside {5}. "They''re pulling our personnel. The ones they\
  \ don''t conscript, they''ll blacklist."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a dry chuckle. "No trial. Just disposal."</p>\
  <p>{2} unpinned the unit badge from {7} chest and tossed it onto the table. "Let them erase our name. It won''t stop \
  us from remembering who we were."</p>\
  <p>"The Caesar sees only results," {10} muttered. "We''re just the latest casualty."</p>\
  <p>{1} leaned back. "Et tu, Caesar..."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.MH=The courtyard was made for parades, not thought. Banners of the \
  Marian Centurion hung between ferrocrete pillars. {0} stood beneath one, hands behind {7} back, helmet at \
  {7} feet.\
  <p>"All supplies loaded. Armor scrubbed. They think we''re headed for the next raid," {9} said, voice \
  clipped.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s eyes never left the statue in the center of the courtyard - Caesar, sword in one hand, globe in the other. \
  "You ever notice the statues always face outward?"</p>\
  <p>{10} glanced at it. "Conquest, {20}. No glory in looking inward."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded once. "Then let''s not give them the satisfaction."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks stood in formation - sharp, clean, disciplined. Every pilot ready. Every order \
  followed. Except this one wasn''t from the Hegemony.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll call it cowardice," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"Only because they can''t imagine disobedience as strength."</p>\
  <p>They turned their backs on the statue and marched to the hangars - no ceremony, no shame. Only choice.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.MH=The DropShip cut through space like a thrown spear. Inside, \
  {0} sat near the central corridor, where imperial edicts were once posted on a holoscreen now dark.\
  <p>{9} stood nearby, arms crossed. "They haven''t hailed us. Probably haven''t realized yet."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll know soon," {1} said. "Caesar always notices when one of his blades goes missing."</p>\
  <p>{10} looked at {14}. "We followed orders. We brought glory. We earned scars. So what broke?"</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer right away. Then: "I got tired of confusing cruelty with discipline."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the nav plot twisted toward a pirate point. No targets. No glory. Just survival - and maybe something \
  more.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll brand us traitors," {10} said. "And the legions will hunt us for sport."</p>\
  <p>"Let them come," {1} said. "We''re still soldiers. Just not theirs."</p>\
  <p>{2} stood, adjusted {7} uniform, and walked toward the command deck. {18} were about to cross the \
  Rubicon.</p>

# Tortuga Dominions
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.TD=The disbandment order didn''t come through secure \
  channels. It was broadcast. Public. Mocking.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "You''re done."<br>\
  "You lost multiple raids, let captives escape, and left salvage on the field."<br>\
  "You''re a disgrace to the Dominions and a waste of good guns."<br>\
  "Your banner''s ashes will be scattered in the garbage chute. That''s all the ceremony you''ve earned."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the middle of a shattered barracks compound, surrounded by silence and scorn. No one was \
  coming to collect the remains. No one cared enough to strip the place bare.</p>\
  <p>{9} kicked over an empty ammo crate. "Quartermaster pulled the plug already. We''re lucky they didn''t \
  send executioners."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked down at {7} sidearm, then at the handful of soldiers still milling around. "No orders. No salvage. No\
  \ reason to stay."</p>\
  <p>"No one left to disappoint either," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>{1} spat into the dust. "We''re not being disbanded. We''re being thrown out with the scraps."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.TD=The comm recording looped one last time and cut out with\
  \ a static buzz. No closing line. Just contempt.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "You''re a disgrace to the Dominions and a waste of good guns."<br>\
  "Your banner''s ashes will be scattered in the garbage chute."<br>\
  "That''s all the ceremony you''ve earned."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} slumped in a maintenance bay, watching the unit patch in {7} palm curl under the heat.</p>\
  <p>{9} tossed down a bag of stripped tags. "They''re not hunting us. Not worth it."</p>\
  <p>"They think we''re broken," {1} said. "That we''ll eat each other in a week."</p>\
  <p>{10} sat across from {7}. "They might be right."</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "Not yet."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached over, lit the patch on fire, and watched it turn to ash.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.TD=The MekBay stank of oil, blood, and booze. A Tortugan \
  banner - stitched from the uniforms of defeated opponents - hung over the catwalk like a dare. {0} wiped \
  {7} blade clean, even though no one had attacked. Yet.\
  <p>"Ammo''s loaded. Fuel''s topped. No one''s sober enough to ask questions," {9} said, pacing fast, low. \
  "We can be off-world in six."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer. Just stared at the rows of looted trophies lining the wall - helmets, medals, bones. "We stayed\
  \ too long."</p>\
  <p>{10} barked a laugh. "We were born too late."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the ''Meks looked like monsters - spikes welded onto ancient armor, kill marks painted in blood. They \
  weren''t soldiers. They were tools for fear.</p>\
  <p>"You know what they''ll do when they find out?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Same thing they always do. Burn everything. Then lie about it."</p>\
  <p>"So why leave now?"</p>\
  <p>"Because I''d rather be hunted than belong to this place one minute longer."</p>\
  <p>They mounted up in silence. No speeches. No goodbyes. Just the rising scream of outbound DropShips and the \
  promise of fire in their wake.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.TD=The DropShip was patched together from six different hulls and held \
  aloft by spite and scavenged parts. Inside, {0} sat in the cargo bay beside an open crate of \
  grenades - none standard issue, all lethal.\
  <p>{9} stood by the ramp controls. "We scrubbed the logs. Changed the transponder. Took down the \
  banners."</p>\
  <p>"Won''t matter," {1} said. "Anyone with eyes will know we were Tortuga."</p>\
  <p>{10} sighed. "We helped build the worst version of ourselves. You think we can undo that?"</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look at {14}. "No. But we can stop adding to it."</p>\
  <p>The nav computer pinged. Their course was set: anywhere that wasn''t here.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll come after us," {10} said. "Not for justice. For sport."</p>\
  <p>"Let ''em," {1} muttered. "They''re not the only bastards out here."</p>\
  <p>The ship rumbled as burn engaged. {18} didn''t disappear quietly - they vanished like a threat they \
  hadn''t decided how to make yet.</p>

# ComStar
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.CS=The directive came through a monochrome terminal, \
  encoded in ritual phrasing and sterile syntax.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "This message serves as formal notice that {18} is hereby disbanded, effective immediately."<br>\
  "This decision follows extensive review of combat effectiveness, chain-of-command breakdowns, and mission failure rates."<br>\

  "You have served under the shadow of the Word. Let what follows be defined by a return to clarity."\

  <p>{0} removed {7} rank sash and folded it in silence. All around {5}, personnel moved with quiet \

  <p>{9} approached with a datapad. "Transport requests processed. Everyone''s being reassigned or returned\

  <p>{1} gave a single nod. "The Word has spoken."</p>\
  <p>"And it no longer includes us," {10} replied.</p>\
  <p>{18} would not be punished. They would be forgotten.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.CS=The communiqué displayed one last time before erasing \

  <p>{0} sat quietly in the crew bay. The lighting had dimmed, and even the usual comms chatter had gone \
  still.</p>\
  <p>{9} took the seat beside {5}. "They''ve archived our combat logs. Sanitized the record."</p>\
  <p>{1} traced a finger over the blank space where the unit''s emblem used to be. "Cleansing, they call it."</p>\
  <p>"Closure," {10} added. "But it feels like deletion."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t argue. {2} simply sat, quiet, and let the silence settle in like a benediction.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.CS=The data vaults beneath the ComStar outpost were silent - clean white\
  \ walls, polished steel doors, and the ever-present hum of machines older than memory. {0} stood in {7} \
  robes, stripped of rank insignia, eyes fixed on the empty seal of the Order.\
  <p>{9} stepped into the chamber. "The code-layer''s cracked. Our ID scrubbed. We ghost out at dawn."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look at {14}. "They sent the last communiqué under the old cipher. That wasn''t an accident. That was a\
  \ warning."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "They want you to know you''ve been seen. Judged."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks stood under blackout protocols - ComStar-white painted over, markings gone. \
  Apostles turned apostates.</p>\
  <p>"You think they''ll come for us?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>"They won''t need to," {1} said. "They''ll rewrite us. Reassign our names. Repurpose our deaths."</p>\
  <p>"Then why do it?"</p>\
  <p>{1} finally turned. "Because truth isn''t sacred if you can''t speak it. And silence isn''t peace."</p>\
  <p>They left the chamber as the lights dimmed behind them. ComStar would deny {18} ever existed. But \
  their heresy would echo.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.CS=The DropShip glided through deep space, hull stripped bare, ComStar \
  IFF codes purged. Inside, the crew moved like ghosts. Nobody spoke unless they had to.\
  <p>{0} stood at the command terminal, watching the old mission orders scroll by - encrypted, impersonal, \
  absolute.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached. "We''re off the grid. Navigation clean. Nothing broadcast."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "And the backups?"</p>\
  <p>{10} hesitated. "I burned them. Everything with our real designations. Even the baptism records."</p>\
  <p>{1} closed {7} eyes. "Then we''re already dead."</p>\
  <p>"You think they''ll hunt us?"</p>\
  <p>"No. They''ll correct us. Quietly. Like a glitch in a sacred algorithm."</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned on the console. "You could''ve stayed. Reaffirmed your Oath."</p>\
  <p>"They teach us that knowledge is power," {1} said. "But power without conscience is just control."</p>\
  <p>The nav lights turned green. Outside, space waited. Cold. Final. Free.</p>\
  <p>{18} didn''t speak again until after the jump. In ComStar''s ledger, they were already gone. A \
  clerical adjustment. A blank line where truth used to live.</p>

# Word of Blake
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.WOB=The transmission came without encryption. Just purity.\
  \ And finality.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "{18} has been found guilty of systemic doctrinal drift, insufficient battlefield execution, and poor \
  integration with wider faith operations."<br>\
  "Effective immediately, your unit is disbanded under Divine Order 3:19."<br>\
  "Your assets will be reabsorbed by loyalist forces. Surviving personnel will report for reassignment, review, or \
  spiritual cleansing."<br>\
  "You were given a chance to serve the Word. You failed. The silence you leave behind will be louder than your deeds\
  \ ever were."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood under flickering lights as MekTechs disassembled targeting uplinks and tagged weapons for \
  reclamation. The banners had already been incinerated.</p>\
  <p>{9} walked beside {5}, quiet. "They didn''t even try to interrogate us."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s voice was flat. "Because our sin is complete. They don''t need answers. Just ash."</p>\
  <p>Outside, a cleansing squad escorted soldiers off the field. No accusations. Just verdicts.</p>\
  <p>{1} dropped {7} rank medallion into the fire. It was over.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.WOB=The message displayed in stark monochrome. No seal. No \
  signature. Just condemnation.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Effective immediately, your unit is disbanded under Divine Order 3:19."<br>\
  "You failed to serve the Word. Your silence will be louder than your deeds ever were."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} watched the crew deck empty out. Those who could leave had. Those who stayed would not be \
  reassigned. They would be erased.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached, handing over a hardcoded manifest. "Everything we built - gone from the records."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They don''t need to kill us. They just have to remove context."</p>\
  <p>{10} dropped the unit insignia into a disposal unit. "They want silence."</p>\
  <p>"Then we''ll haunt the void they left," {1} whispered.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.WOB=The garrison''s chapel was quiet, lit by the flickering blue glow \
  of a Blessed Interface Core. Scriptures scrolled across the display - lines of encrypted dogma sanctified by battle. \
  {0} stood before it, head bowed, lips unmoving.\
  <p>{9} approached in silence. {11} removed {16} cap - not for respect, but because it didn''t feel \
  right anymore. "DropShip is ready. Comm silence engaged. Final activation in four minutes."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t move. "They sent a Precentor last night. No warnings. No accusations. She ust... watched."</p>\
  <p>{10} swallowed. "They already knew."</p>\
  <p>"They always know." {1} turned. {6} eyes were hollow. "We stayed too long."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' ''Meks stood at parade rest. They looked pure. Unquestionable. False.</p>\
  <p>"You think they''ll cleanse the records?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They''ll call it apostasy. Rewrite our oaths. Say we were deviant. Say we were corrected."</p>\
  <p>{2} stepped forward, voice like stone. "But we leave of our own will. That''s all that matters now."</p>\
  <p>They walked away as alarms stayed silent - because heretics are always most dangerous before they''re named.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.WOB=The DropShip burned through dead space, its transponder gutted, its\
  \ logs sanitized. Inside, the chapel had been stripped - no interface core, no litany scrolls, no Holy Silence.\
  <p>{0} stood at the central console, watching the system map cycle blank. A line of text blinked: <em>"No\
  \ Truth Received."</em></p>\
  <p>{9} entered. "Nav says we''re off-course. Might miss the jump."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look away. "Good. I''d rather be lost than followed."</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned in. "You know they''ll send hunters. Not soldiers. Redeemers."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They won''t kill us. They''ll try to bring us back. Break us. Reformat us."</p>\
  <p>"And if we resist?"</p>\
  <p>"Then they kill us. Kindly. Efficiently. Like a purge of corrupted data."</p>\
  <p>The lights dimmed to red as power rerouted. Jump drive spooling. The last step.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned to {10}. "They taught us silence. But I remember the first time I spoke freely."</p>\
  <p>{10} smiled faintly. "This is the second."</p>\
  <p>They jumped. Behind them, the Word remained - watching. Waiting. Already writing their erasure.</p>

# Clan
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.clan=The order came in precisely, without delay or emotion.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "As of this hour, this unit is formally disbanded."<br>\
  "Your collective failure in the field, repeated insubordination, and loss of strategic assets have led to this \
  decision."<br>\
  "Surviving warriors will be reassigned individually. Commanders will report for judgment."<br>\
  "The name of this force is removed from the rolls."<br>\
  "Your deeds have been weighed and found unworthy of the Remembrance."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the central square of the garrison, surrounded by silence. No warriors saluted. No \
  traditions were honored. Their name was already gone.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached. "Our codex records have been purged. Even the sibko tags are revoked."</p>\
  <p>"We have become stravag," {1} said quietly. "Ghosts among the living."</p>\
  <p>"Shall we submit to judgment?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned away. "Judgment is for the worthy."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.clan=The command screen glowed cold blue. The final message\
  \ blinked once and was deleted from the system automatically.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit disbanded."<br>\
  "Warriors reassigned."<br>\
  "Name erased."<br>\
  "Unworthy of the Remembrance."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood at the center of the DropShip''s observation deck. There were no unit patches left. No \
  rituals. Just stripped walls and personal effects sealed for disposal.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached. "The Remembrance will not carry our name."</p>\
  <p>{1} said nothing. {2} was watching the stars, one hand pressed to the glass.</p>\
  <p>"Do we still exist?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>"Only in memory. And memory fades."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.planetside.clan=The granite floor of the Clan barracks echoed under Commander \
  {1}''s boots. No banners. No decoration. Just precision. Function. Control. Every sound measured. Every movement \
  tracked.\
  <p>"It is done," said {9}, standing rigid. "Our DropShip prepped under the guise of a Trial of \
  Reassignment. No alarms. No contest."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t turn. "They won''t believe we left without Trial."</p>\
  <p>"They will say we were <i>flawed</i>. Freebirth in spirit, if not in gene."</p>\
  <p>"They may be right," {1} said. "But they will not say it twice."</p>\
  <p>Outside, {18}'' OmniMeks were idle. No formation. No ritual. No bidding. Just readiness without \
  ceremony - heresy in metal.</p>\
  <p>{10} kept {16} eyes forward. "Do you fear being forgotten?"</p>\
  <p>{1} finally turned. "They bred us to be memory. But we were never meant to <i>choose.</i>"</p>\
  <p>They walked toward the landing field in silence. No salute. No honor code. No bonds left to break. Just warriors\
  \ choosing identity over obedience.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.inTransit.clan=The DropShip cruised beyond the solar fringe. No Clan markings \
  remained. No crests. No honor glyphs. Just stripped alloy and silence.\
  <p>{0} sat near the weapons locker, gaze fixed on a scratched metal panel - an old Clan emblem mostly \
  burned away.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered. "We are clear of the Clan sensor net. Autonav programmed for a Merchant Caste corridor. \
  No broadcast. No challenge."</p>\
  <p>"They will assume we died in a Trial. Or were cast out."</p>\
  <p>{10} folded {16} arms. "We are dezgra. Now and forever."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s voice was low. "Then why does it feel like freedom?"</p>\
  <p>The nav lights shifted. Green for course. Red for return - always red.</p>\
  <p>"Do you think any of them will understand?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "They are Clan. They do not understand. They <i>accept</i>."</p>\
  <p>The ship burned quiet, cutting a new path into unknown space. {18} were gone. Not defeated. Not \
  dishonored.</p>\
  <p>Just <i>free.</i></p>
# SEPPUKU
## Planetside
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.0={0} kneels in the courtyard of the compound, stripped \
  of insignia, {7} uniform bare but clean. The morning air is sharp, the silence absolute. Before {5} {8, choice, \
  0#lie|1#lies} the blade - gleaming, precise, unforgiving. {2} {8, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} it up without hesitation.\
  <p>Across from {5}, {9} stands, calm, {16} eyes fixed not on {1} but on the moment itself.</p>\
  <p>{1} draws a breath, deep and final, then drives the blade into {7} abdomen, cutting across with practiced \
  resolve. Blood blooms across {7} uniform, but {3} {8, choice, 0#make|1#makes} no sound. {6} body begins to \
  tremble.</p>\
  <p>In that instant - swift as a heartbeat - {10} rises. {15} sword flashes, a blur of motion and steel. The \
  courtyard remains still.</p>\
  <p>{10} sheathes {16} sword, expression locked, bearing the weight of honor passed from one warrior to another.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.1={0} kneels in the center of the stone courtyard, {7} \
  gaze steady, {7} expression carved from resolve. The blade before {5} rests on a folded cloth, its edge flawless, \
  untouched by hesitation.\
  <p>Wind rustles the banners above - {7} unit''s colors. {9} stands behind {5}, silent, motionless, {16} katana \
  drawn but lowered in respect.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, grips the hilt, and slides the blade into {7} abdomen with slow, deliberate force. {6} jaw \
  tightens as {3} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} it across, blood staining the stone beneath {5}. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#does|1#do} not falter.</p>\
  <p>In that final, shuddering moment, {10} steps forward, lifts {16} blade, and strikes in a single, clean arc. \
  {1}''s body slumps forward, the head tilting but held by a narrow strip of flesh.</p>\
  <p>The silence after is complete. {10} bows once, low and deep, then turns without a word, the ritual complete and\
  \ the shame extinguished.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.2={0} kneels beneath the overcast sky, rain tapping \
  softly against {7} shoulders, staining the ceremonial cloth set before {5}. {4} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} \
  flinch.\
  <p>The courtyard is empty, save for {9}, who stands a pace behind, katana unsheathed and held in both \
  hands, blade down.</p> \
  <p>{1} lifts the short sword with reverence - {7} last act of command - and presses the tip into {7} abdomen. {2} \
  {8, choice, 0#exhale|1#exhales}, slow and steady, then {8, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} the blade across in a \
  sharp, brutal arc. {4} breath catches, but {3} {8, choice, 0#do|1#does} not cry out. {4} {8, choice, \
  0#lean|1#leans} forward, strength failing. In that instant, {10} moves. One clean motion, steel slicing air, and\
  \ {1}''s head dips forward, the body folding over itself.</p>\
  <p>The rain keeps falling. {10} lowers {16} sword, blood dripping from the edge, and bows - deep, respectful. The \
  Combine''s honor, reclaimed in silence.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.3={0} kneels in the gravel courtyard, bare hands resting\
  \ on {7} thighs, the short blade laid precisely before {5}. {6} uniform is spotless, {7} posture perfect - \
  unyielding even now.\
  <p>Across from {5}, {9} waits, katana drawn, face unreadable behind a mask of discipline.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, grips the blade, and raises it to {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} \
  hesitate. The steel sinks in with a wet sound, and {3} pulls it sideways, a grimace flickering across {7} face \
  before resolve clamps down again.</p>\
  <p>Blood flows freely. {6} breath comes shallow. As {3} {8, choice, 0#start|1#starts} to pitch forward, {10} steps\
  \ in - one clean stroke, neck to shoulder. {1}''s head rolls to the ground, and {10} stands still for a moment, rain\
  \ beginning to fall, and then bows, low and wordless. The unit''s shame dies with their commander.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.4={0} kneels in the center of the parade square, \
  shoes placed neatly behind {5}, the cold steel of the tanto resting across {7} palms. The sky is clear, the air \
  still - too calm for what''s about to happen.</p>\
  <p>{6} breathing is steady. {2} {8, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} once, then {8, choice, 0#unsheathe|1#unsheathes} the \
  blade with care, as if it still deserves respect.</p> \
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana drawn; the angle already measured in {16} mind. {1} grips the \
  blade, presses it to {7} abdomen, and drives it in. {2} {8, choice, 0#cut|1#cuts} across with grim precision, \
  teeth clenched, shoulders locked against the pain. As {7} body starts to sag, {10} moves. The katana whispers \
  through the air and finds its mark in a single, practiced strike. {1} folds forward, blood soaking into the earth\
  .</p>\
  <p>{10} holds the pose for a moment longer, then lowers the blade and bows. There are no words. The act speaks for\
  \ itself.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.5={0} kneels on the worn flagstones, back straight, eyes\
  \ forward, the tanto resting before {5} like a verdict. Behind {5}, {9} waits, katana raised, breath \
  held. The silence is total - no wind, no birds, just the slow heartbeat of tradition pressing down on both warriors\
  .</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches for the blade, lifts it, and without ceremony or pause, plunges it into {7} gut. {6} jaw clenches. \
  {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade across, slow and deliberate, pain surging through every nerve. {6} body \
  begins to falter. In that instant, {10} steps forward and strikes. The katana arcs cleanly, stopping the fall, \
  preserving the ritual.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body slumps gently, head bowed, blood darkening the stone. {10} lowers {16} sword, bows deeply, and \
  stands still - honor upheld, shame erased, nothing left but the silence.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.6={0} kneels in the courtyard, the stone beneath {5} \
  scrubbed clean for this final act. {5} uniform is immaculate, {7} posture flawless - {3} {8, choice, 0#face|1#faces} \
  death as {3} faced every order: without flinching.\
  <p>The tanto gleams in the sunlight, resting across {7} knees like a promise. Behind {5}, {9} stands \
  silent, katana drawn, arms steady.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, draws in a breath, and drives it into {7} belly. The cut is deep, decisive. Blood spills, \
  staining the cloth beneath {5}. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} cry out. {6} body trembles, begins to collapse. \
  <p>{10} moves - one fluid motion - and the katana flashes. {1}''s head lowers as the sword completes its arc.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps back, lowers {16} blade, and bows, slow and deep. The ritual is done. The Dragon watches.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.7={0} kneels in the quiet courtyard, back straight, \
  hands steady, the tanto resting across {7} lap like a final command. The banners above {5} hang limp in the still \
  air, as if the world itself is holding its breath. Behind {5}, {9} stands motionless, katana drawn, eyes\
  \ fixed on the warrior {12} once followed into the fire.</p> \
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, the metal catching the light one last time, and plunges it into {7} abdomen. The cut is \
  clean, practiced, unforgiving. Blood wells and spills. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade across with grim \
  resolve, {7} body beginning to waver.</p>\
  <p>In that moment, {10} steps forward - silent, sure - and strikes. The katana sings through the air, and {1}''s \
  head falls forward. {10} lowers {16} blade and bows deeply, the weight of duty settling over {14} like ash. The \
  Dragon''s justice has been done.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.8={0} kneels on the tarmac of the compound, the scent of \
  incense curling through the still air. {6} uniform bears no rank, only the blood-red sash of final duty. The tanto \
  rests before {5}, its edge gleaming - sharp, precise, inevitable. Behind {5}, {9} stands at attention, \
  katana raised, breath measured.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade, bows {7} head once, and drives it into {7} abdomen. {6} breath hitches. The steel carves\
  \ across flesh with slow deliberation, {7} hands steady even as pain surges through {5}. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#lean|1#leans} forward, faltering.</p>\
  <p>In that instant, {10} moves. One step. One strike. The katana falls like judgment, and {1}''s body slumps. {10}\
  \ holds {16} stance, then lowers {5}self to the ground, bowing until {16} forehead nearly touches the stone. The \
  shame has ended. Only silence remains.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.9={0} kneels beneath an old cherry tree, its blossoms \
  fallen and scattered like the names of the dead. {6} boots are placed neatly behind {5}, {7} gloves folded beside \
  the tanto on the mat. {2} {8, choice, 0#close|1#closes} {7} eyes - not in fear, but in focus.\
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana poised, the weight of the moment etched into every muscle.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, breathes in once, then drives it into {7} abdomen with unflinching force. The cut is slow, \
  deliberate, {7} face locked in stoic defiance as blood spills across the cloth.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body begins to sag. {10} steps forward, swift and sure. The katana arcs, whispering through the air, and \
  finds its mark with surgical precision. {1}''s head lowers but does not fall. The ritual holds. {10} lowers the \
  blade and bows, the silence now sacred. The commander''s honor is restored. The Dragon need not speak.</p>
## In Transit
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.0={0} kneels on the cold steel floor of the DropShip''s \
  staging bay, the low hum of engines thrumming beneath {5} like a funeral drum. The chamber is stripped bare - no \
  banners, no insignia, just gray walls, and the sharp scent of oil and ozone.\
  <p>Before {1} lies the tanto, its blade resting on a white cloth, stark against the dull metal. Overhead, red \
  emergency lights bathe the room in a slow, pulsing glow. Behind, {9} stands motionless, katana drawn, \
  boots braced against the ship''s subtle vibrations.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, lifts the blade, and draws a breath meant to be {7} last. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#plunge|1#plunges} the steel into {7} abdomen and {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} across, {7} jaw locked against the \
  pain. Blood splatters across the deck. {2} {8, choice, 0#begin|1#begins} to falter.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps in. One strike - precise, practiced - severs the moment cleanly. {1}''s head tilts forward, body \
  folding over itself, still. The hum of the ship continues, uncaring.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} blade, bows deeply on the blood-slick deck, and says nothing. In the belly of a machine built \
  for war, a warrior''s end is honored with silence.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.1={0} kneels on the cargo deck of the DropShip, the groan\
  \ of metal echoing through the hull as the vessel idles. Overhead, fluorescent lights flicker in rhythm with the \
  ship''s systems - harsh, sterile, unflinching. The staging area has been cleared, save for a white cloth beneath the\
  \ tanto and a sealed floor drain meant for other kinds of spills.\
  <p>{1}''s uniform bears no rank. No medals. Only the crimson sash tied tightly at {7} waist. Behind {5}, {10} stands\
  \ still, katana drawn, eyes locked forward, face set like stone. The air feels too dry. Too sterile.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade. No ceremony. No hesitation. {2} just {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} it into {7} gut and \
  {8, choice, 0#slice|1#slices} across, {7} breath caught in {7} throat, blood spilling onto the white cloth. The \
  deck vibrates faintly beneath {7}. {2} {8, choice, 0#waver|1#wavers}.</p>\
  <p>{10} moves in, smooth and silent. One clean strike. The katana arcs and lands true, stopping {1}''s collapse \
  with merciful finality. {6} head dips, still held by a fleshly tether. {6} body slumps.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps back. {11} {17, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} - low, exact, unwavering. Around them, the DropShip rumbles, \
  indifferent. In the eyes of the Dragon duty has been fulfilled, and disgrace laid to rest.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.2={0} kneels on the hard plating of the DropShip''s inner \
  deck, the floor vibrating softly with the pulse of fusion engines. Around {5}, the cargo bay is stripped bare - no \
  audience, no ceremony, just steel walls and silence. The overhead lights cast a harsh white glare, throwing {7} \
  shadow long across the deck.\
  <p>The tanto rests before {5} on a folded white cloth. Its blade catches the light, steady and unforgiving. Behind \
  {5}, {9} stands at attention, katana drawn, body still despite the faint shudder of the DropShip.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches for the blade, {7} breath slow and even. No words. No hesitation. {2} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} \
  the tanto into {7} abdomen, the cut deep and clean. {2} {8, choice, 0#drag|1#drags} it across with deliberate \
  force, blood spilling in rivulets across the deck. {6} arms shake. {6} balance wavers.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One motion. One cut. The katana sings through the air and ends it - precise, controlled, \
  merciful. {1}''s body folds forward, head bowed, still tethered.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} blade and bows, the gesture sharp and deep. The ship continues on, unaware. But in that stark, \
  bloodied space, honor has been answered.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.3={0} kneels on the DropShip''s maintenance deck, \
  surrounded by cold metal and the low, steady hum of life-support systems. The walls are lined with tool lockers and\
  \ bulkhead piping - no shrine, no ceremony, just function. The only thing out of place is the white cloth laid \
  neatly before {5}, and the tanto glinting under the harsh utility lights.\
  <p>{2}''{8, choice, 0#ve|1#s} stripped down - no insignia, no armor, just the crimson sash, and the weight of \
  failure. Behind {5}, {9} stands still, katana in hand, {16} expression fixed, {16} boots locked against \
  the subtle shift of the DropShip.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, inhales once, and plunges it into {7} belly. The steel bites deep. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#pull|1#pulls} it across with firm, methodical precision, blood spilling onto the white cloth, pooling between the\
  \ seams in the deck plating. {6} breath rattles. {6} body starts to give.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward and ends it - one clean, silent stroke. The katana arcs and stops with purpose. {1} slumps, \
  head bowed, the final thread of dignity preserved.</p>\
  <p>{10} bows deeply, the red stain creeping toward {16} boots. The engines drone on. Outside, the stars don''t blink. \
  But here, in this quiet steel tomb, honor has been paid in full.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.4={0} kneels on the DropShip''s secondary hold, a space \
  meant for overflow cargo - now silent, repurposed, sacred in its own grim way. The deck is bare but for a single \
  tarp beneath {5}, a folded cloth, and the tanto resting like a final sentence. Overhead, the lights buzz faintly, \
  cold and clinical. The hum of the vessel is constant, steady, uncaring.\
  <p>{6} uniform has been stripped of rank. Only the red sash remains. Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana \
  drawn, feet shoulder-width apart, balance honed against the subtle sway of transit. {15} eyes don''t move from {1}''s \
  back.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade. {6} hands don''t tremble. No words are spoken - none are needed. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#thrust|1#thrusts} the tanto into {7} abdomen and draws it across, slow and resolute. Blood spills fast onto the \
  tarp, dark and steaming in the recycled air. {2} {8, choice, 0#begin|1#begins} to fall.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. {15} blade arcs in a clean, perfect motion - one stroke, no sound but steel parting air. \
  {1}''s head lowers, body folding with gravity''s pull.</p>\
  <p>{10} stands over {5} for a breath, then bows - deep, precise. The hum of the ship continues. Outside, nothing \
  changes. Inside, everything has.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.5={0} kneels in one of the DropShip''s combat bays, the \
  scent of grease and coolant still thick in the air. Overhead, hydraulic arms hang motionless, and the distant \
  clatter of tools from another deck echoes like ghosts of the living. The bay lights are dimmed by request. All \
  unnecessary systems shut down for this moment.\
  <p>Before {5} lies the tanto on a simple white cloth. No fanfare. No symbols. Just steel and silence. Behind {5}, \
  {9} stands poised, katana drawn, boots braced against the subtle vibration of the DropShip. {15} face is \
  unreadable, {16} duty absolute.</p>\
  <p>{1} takes one final breath, lifts the blade, and plunges it into {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} \
  across slowly, teeth clenched, blood running hot down {7} thighs and pooling on the deck. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#don''t|1#doesn''t} scream. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} falter.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One step, one swing. The katana arcs with surgical grace and lands true. {1}''s body folds, \
  head bowed, final posture intact.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers the blade, then bows, deep and long. No one claps. No one speaks. But within the sealed metal shell\
  \ of that DropShip, a commander dies with honor - and a soldier bears witness.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.6={0} kneels on the grated floor of the DropShip''s\
  \ deployment bay, surrounded by shadows cast by idle war machines. The red standby lights blink in rhythm with the \
  ship''s heartbeat, casting the scene in a muted pulse of warning and farewell. The air is dense with the scent of \
  metal, hydraulic fluid, and inevitability.\
  <p>Before {5} lies the tanto on a folded white cloth, its edge catching the red light like a quiet threat. {2} {8, \
  choice, 0#wear|1#wears} no insignia, no armor - only the crimson sash across {7} waist, tied with purpose. Behind \
  {5}, {9} stands in silence, katana drawn, body still, eyes forward.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade with steady hands. {2} {8, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} in a breath, sharp and final, then drives \
  the tanto into {7} abdomen. The blade carves across, slow and sure, blood spilling down {7} legs, pooling on the \
  mesh floor. The deck continues to hum beneath {5}, indifferent.</p>\
  <p>As {3} {8, choice, 0#start|1#starts} to sag forward, {10} moves. One clean motion. The katana flashes and ends it\
  \ - a precise strike, neither rushed nor delayed. {1}''s body folds, {6} head dipping forward but still held by a \
  slither of skin.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} sword, bows deeply, then remains still. Outside, stars stretch across the void. Inside, in that\
  \ steel-walled peace between wars, one warrior''s shame has been answered - and another carries it forward.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.7={0} kneels in the DropShip''s auxiliary storage bay, \
  surrounded by empty crates and bare metal walls that echo every breath like a confession. The ship rumbles softly \
  beneath {5}, engines pushing through the void, but in this moment, the world has narrowed to blood, steel, and \
  silence. A single work light casts a harsh cone over the tanto resting on a folded cloth - {7} final companion.\
  <p>{1} wears no rank, only the red sash of obligation. Behind {5}, {9} stands still as a statue, katana \
  drawn, blade angled low, waiting for the final cue.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the tanto. There is no tremor in {7} grip. No hesitation. {2} {8, choice, 0#plunge|1#plunges} the \
  blade into {7} abdomen and pulls across, teeth clenched, breath short. Blood flows freely, painting the cloth, \
  dripping onto the steel beneath. {6} strength ebbs. {6} body begins to tilt.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One perfect arc, honed by duty and grief, and the katana falls true. {1} slumps forward, \
  head bowed, the blade still in {7} hands. {10} lowers {16} sword and bows, slow and deep. Around {14}, the DropShip \
  hums on, unshaken. But for one warrior, the journey ends here - in silence, in steel, in honor.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.8={0} kneels on the bare plating of the DropShip''s crew \
  staging bay, stripped of insignia, {7} uniform marked only by the crimson sash tied tight around {7} waist. The hum\
  \ of the ship surrounds {5} - constant, low, and uncaring. Overhead, a single utility light casts a hard glow on \
  the tanto before {5}, its blade resting on a worn cloth stained from earlier rites.\
  <p>Behind {1}, {9} stands ready, katana in hand, posture razor-straight. The room is sealed, empty but \
  for them. No audience. No ceremony. Just obligation and duty.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, lifts the blade, and breathes in one last time. Then {3} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} the \
  tanto into {7} belly and drags it across, slow, precise. {6} body seizes, blood spilling fast across the cloth, \
  down to the seams of the steel floor. {2} {8, choice, 0#lean|1#leans} forward, strength giving way.</p>\
  <p>{10} moves. One step, one arc of steel. The katana sings through the silence and ends it cleanly. {1}''s head \
  bows forward, body folding into itself.</p>\
  <p>{10} holds still for a beat, then lowers {16} sword and bows deep, {16} shadow stretching long across the deck. \
  Outside, the stars wait. Inside, the Dragon has been served.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.9={0} kneels on the DropShip''s maintenance sub-deck, far \
  below the hum of crew chatter or the familiar clank of ''Mek servos. Down here, it''s quiet - just the drone of the \
  fusion engine and the dim flicker of emergency lights reflecting off steel walls. The floor is cold beneath {7} \
  knees. The tanto lies before {5} on a folded strip of linen, stained faintly from past use, its blade sharp enough \
  to reflect the solemnity in {7} eyes.\
  <p>{1} wears the red sash, nothing more. Behind {5}, {9} stands still, katana drawn, arms loose but \
  ready, eyes fixed on the point beyond the act. There''s no dialogue. No ritual chant. Just breath and gravity.</p>\
  <p>{1} takes the blade, grips it tight, and drives it into {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} across \
  with control, not haste. Blood pours out, dark and fast, spattering the deck. {2} {8, choice, 0#waver|1#wavers}.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps in. The katana flashes in the dim light - one cut, clean and final. {1} folds forward, {7} head \
  dipping low but not falling. {10} lowers the blade. {11} {17, choice, 0#bow|1#bows}, slow and deep, the silence \
  thick. Above them, the ship carries on. Below, one warrior finds peace in steel, and another carries the weight of \
  it.</p>
