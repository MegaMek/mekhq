# Inner Sphere Generic
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.innerSphere=The rain hadn''t stopped in two days. It didn''t\
  \ pour - just misted endlessly, beading on steel plating, soaking into fatigues. {0} stood beneath the \
  open hangar awning, staring at the deactivated BattleMeks. Silent hulks. Their cockpits were sealed. No tech\
  \ crews. No pilots.\
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} read the transmission again on a datapad, as if repetition might reveal an escape \
  clause.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>"By order of High Command, your unit is hereby dissolved..."</em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{10} didn''t speak, just lowered the pad and waited.</p>\
  <p>{1} inhaled the oily scent of coolant runoff and dead ambition. "They''re taking everything."</p>\
  <p>"Personnel have forty-eight hours to report in. ''Meks are being boxed for redistribution." {10}''s voice was \
  dry. Defeated.</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out across the tarmac. Men and women stood in quiet clusters. No shouting. No rebellion. Just the \
  ache of shared failure. "{18} die here."</p>\
  <p>{10} offered a stiff nod. "Banner''s already down. You wanna say something to them?"</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "They don''t need speeches. They need jobs."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned, walking back into the dim compound. No ceremony. No salute. Just the sound of doors hissing shut \
  behind {5}.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.innerSphere=The compound''s comms tower was dark. Broadcast\
  \ silence for twelve hours. {19}''s star was setting behind the hills, lighting the perimeter walls in \
  blood-orange.\
  <p>{0} paced the Operations center, boots thudding softly on concrete. {9} stood over a \
  schematic of the compound''s gates and fuel lines.</p>\
  <p>"Three hours before High Command tries to enforce the order," {10} said. "Less if they''ve still got eyes in \
  orbit."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s jaw was tight. "We''re not letting them take the ''Meks. We earned those."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll come in hard," {10} warned. "This is treason."</p>\
  <p>"No." {1} stopped. "This is survival. They gave up on us. I''m just returning the favor."</p>\
  <p>Outside, tech crews worked fast - overclocking engines, bypassing lockouts, fueling DropShips on borrowed time.</p>\
  <p>"{18} aren''t dead," {1} said. "They''re just changing shareholders."</p>\
  <p>{10} smirked despite {14}self. "Where do we go?"</p>\
  <p>"I''ve arranged the deails, but it doesn''t matter. We take our people and we vanish."</p>\
  <p>The compound shuddered as a DropShip''s reactor spun up. {19} wouldn''t remember them for long - but \
  someone, somewhere, would learn who they were real soon.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.innerSphere=The DropShip drifted in silence between jumps. \
  Inside, it felt like a mausoleum.\
  <p>{0} sat alone in the briefing room, eyes on the holotable that used to chart mission deployments. Now \
  it displayed a single line of text:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>"All personnel are to report to reassignment centers within 48 hours."</em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The map of the Inner Sphere flickered and vanished.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered, locking the door behind {14}. "It''s official. Quartermasters are sending codes to \
  deactivate the ''Meks. We don''t even get to park them ourselves."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s knuckles whitened against the table''s edge. "I gave this unit years of my life, we all did."</p>\
  <p>"I know."</p>\
  <p>{2} tapped the back of a stylus against {7} leg. "We didn''t lose because we quit. We lost because command stopped\
  \ caring."</p>\
  <p>{10} raised {16} eyes. "They''ll erase our name from the rolls."</p>\
  <p>{1} stood. "Then we remember it ourselves."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into {7} uniform jacket, pulled out a stitched unit patch, the stylized symbol of {18}. \
  {2} set it on the table, pressed it flat.</p>\
  <p>"I''m not going to forget."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.innerSphere=The lights were dimmed, the crew running \
  silent. {0} leaned against a bulkhead outside the armory, watching the ''Mek pilots suit up like it was a \
  normal deployment.</p>\
  <p>It wasn''t.</p>\
  <p>{9} walked over, helmet clipped to {16} belt. "Override codes held. ''Meks are ours. JumpShip''s hot \
  in ten."</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled. "We clear on supplies?"</p>\
  <p>"Three months'' rations, a full repair bay, and a quarter ton of deniable transponders. We''re ghosts."</p>\
  <p>{1} stepped into the locker bay and ran {7} hand along a painted plaque above the lockers: <i>{18}</i>.</p>\
  <p>"They sent us that disbandment notice like we were assets to be liquidated," {3} said. "Not people. Not \
  warriors."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "Guess we''ll have to remind them."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip''s intercom pinged once. "{0} to the bridge."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned to go, then stopped. "Burn the comm relays after jump. No trails."</p>\
  <p>{10} grinned. "Already wired."</p>\
  <p>They weren''t leaving in disgrace. They were leaving on their own terms. And wherever they landed next, the name \
  ''<i>{18}</i>'' was going to carry a whole new kind of weight.</p>
# Capellan Confederation
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.CC=The black-and-green crest of the Confederation still \
  hung over the compound gates, but no one saluted it anymore. Not today.\
  <p>{0} stood on the central parade ground, datapad clutched behind {7} back, face unreadable. Rain \
  slicked the red-tinted concrete. {9} approached quietly, boots precise, posture rigid - even now.</p>\
  <p>"Order''s confirmed," {10} said. "Redistribution team lands in six hours."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded once. "And the personnel?"</p>\
  <p>"Reporting for reassignment. No resistance. They know what this is."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s eyes flicked to the hangars. Empty already. The ''Meks had been powered down and locked before the message \
  even arrived - Capellan efficiency at work.</p>\
  <p>"We failed them," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>"No, sir," {10} replied flatly. "We failed the Chancellor."</p>\
  <p>A pause. Then {1} slowly removed the unit insignia from {7} shoulder - {18}'' stylized scale now \
  dulled by grime and silence. {2} set it down on a bench.</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t look away. "Orders are orders."</p>\
  <p>"Yes," {1} said, voice a dull echo. "And we are no longer worthy of them."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.CC=The Confederation wanted obedience. Instead, they \
  got silence.\
  <p>{0} stood at the edge of the motor pool, flanked by two locked-down Liao inspectors who hadn''t \
  expected the compound gates to shut behind them. {2} didn''t say a word. The security team handled it cleanly - \
  sedatives, restraints, containment.</p>\
  <p>{9} emerged from the command bunker. "Transmission grid''s down. Local comms only."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll send someone," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>"They already did," {10} replied, gesturing at the unconscious agents. "They didn''t bring a lance with them. \
  That was their mistake."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out at the ''Meks, already warmed up. "Are the crews in?"</p>\
  <p>"Every pilot we trust."</p>\
  <p>{1} turned slowly. "Then this is the last time we breathe Capellan air."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "The Confederation does not carry dead weight. So we carry ourselves."</p>\
  <p>Engines roared to life. Orders would come - reprisal, betrayal, pursuit. But {18} were already \
  moving. Already gone.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.CC=Inside the DropShip, the crew quarters were silent. \
  The command deck had received the formal disbandment message six hours prior. No one questioned it. That would have\
  \ been... inappropriate.\
  <p>{0} sat in the officers'' lounge. Across from {5}, {9} stood with {16} hands folded behind \
  {16} back.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Effective immediately, all personnel are to report for reassignment or discharge..."<br>\
  "...logistical mismanagement."<br>\
  "...dishonor."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>The phrases scrolled endlessly on the terminal.</p>\
  <p>{10} broke the silence. "Crew''s been sorted. Officers split across assignments. Logistics has codes for the \
  hangar bays."</p>\
  <p>{1} stared at the terminal. "No court-martial. No appeal."</p>\
  <p>"This is Capellan mercy."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer. {2} reached into the drawer beside {5} and withdrew a small lacquered box - the last \
  ''{18}'' insignia, polished and sealed. {2} slid it across the table.</p>\
  <p>"To be archived," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} took it without ceremony. "It will be. Quietly."</p>\
  <p>The lights dimmed. The transmission ended. And another failed unit vanished into the folds of the \
  Confederation.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.CC=Red emergency lights pulsed softly along the \
  corridors. Their JumpShip had jumped off-course, off-schedule. They would not be returning to Capellan space.\
  <p>{0} leaned on the steel rail of the launch bay, watching a ''Mek get loaded into a repair gantry. \
  {9} joined {5}, a faint smirk on {16} face.\
  <p>"Asset recovery team was three hours late," {10} said. "Enough time to scrub our transmission records."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "And the jump costs?"</p>\
  <p>"Under an alias. They won''t trace us."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at the rotating planet outside the bay window.</p>\
  <p>"They called us dead weight," {1} said. "Told us to disappear."</p>\
  <p>{10} smiled. "We took them at their word."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t smile back. {2} didn''t need to. {6} orders were already given.</p>\
  <p>The bay doors hissed open. <i>{18}</i> were leaving the Confederation. But they would not leave \
  quietly.</p>
# Draconis Combine
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.DC=The courtyard was swept clean. Even the ash from their \
  torched banners had been collected, as per protocol. {0} knelt on the stone tiles outside the command \
  building, hands resting calmly on {7} thighs. Rain traced lines down {7} face, indistinguishable from tears.\
  <p>{9} stood behind {5}, perfectly still. "Transmission confirmed. Effective immediately, {18} are disbanded under \
  Directive 52-Ni."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded once. "I saw the final order."</p>\
  <p>"Assets will be collected within the hour. Personnel are instructed to report to reassignment posts. The record \
  of our unit will be sealed."</p>\
  <p>{1} rose slowly, every motion deliberate. {2} turned to face the empty ''Mek hangars. "They won''t even remember \
  our name."</p>\
  <p>{10} bowed. "That is the point."</p>\
  <p>{1} unclipped the sword at {7} waist. Not to use it. Just to acknowledge it.</p>\
  <p>"Let our disgrace end with discipline," {3} said. "And nothing more."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.DC=The command center doors sealed behind {9} \
  with a final hiss. Outside, sirens echoed from the perimeter - the first warning pulse of a lockdown breach.\
  <p>{0} stood in the center of the war room, staring at the office shredder. Inside it, the disbandment \
  order had turned to ribbons.</p>\
  <p>"We are no longer part of the DCMS," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped forward. "And if we flee, we are traitors."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked at {14}, calm and certain. "If we stay, we''re dead."</p>\
  <p>Outside, technicians were overriding Combine lockout codes. The ''Meks would be ready in minutes.</p>\
  <p>{10} straightened. "Then we do not flee. We vanish. With steel. With purpose."</p>\
  <p>{1} retrieved {7} sheathed wakizashi and placed it in {7} duffel, not as a ritual - this time, as a weapon.</p>\
  <p>"The Dragon has no use for the weak..." {3} began.</p>\
  <p>"...Then we no longer serve the Dragon," {10} finished, {16} voice firm, resolved.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.DC=The cabin of the DropShip was silent. No movement. No \
  voices. Just the faint hum of interstellar drift and the muted scroll of a terminal displaying the final order.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "This is the final transmission under your unit designation. {18} is to be disbanded..."<br>\
  "...systemic failure of leadership."<br>\
  "...record sealed."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood before the message alone. No ceremony. No final speech. Just duty, finished.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered from the corridor. "Dispersal teams are waiting at the next port. We are to report in \
  full uniform, without insignia."</p>\
  <p>{1} removed the patch from {7} arm and placed it carefully in a small box. Then {3} snapped the box shut and \
  handed it to {10}.</p>\
  <p>"For the archive," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "The record will be sealed, but we will remember."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t reply. {2} sat back down in the meditation posture, closed {7} eyes, and waited to arrive at oblivion \
  with dignity. With honor.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.DC=The DropShip had gone silent the moment the disbandment \
  order arrived. By the time the Combine''s relay finished transmitting, the crew had already erased the navigational \
  logs.\
  <p>{0} stood on the bridge, flanked by {9} and a pair of loyal tech officers. Stars flickered \
  beyond the viewport, indifferent and endless.</p>\
  <p>"We are ghosts now," {10} said. "But armed ones."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "We do not dishonor the Dragon. We remove ourselves before we infect it."</p>\
  <p>{10} handed over a coded slate. "We have coordinates. An independent JumpShip. No Combine loyalty. They''ll \
  accept our payment."</p>\
  <p>"Then we do what is necessary," {1} said. "We remain warriors, even if we are no longer samurai."</p>\
  <p>The Combine had no use for them. But someone would. And {18} would never kneel again.</p>
# Lyran Commonwealth
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.LA=The order arrived with precise formatting and zero \
  delay - uploaded into every terminal simultaneously. A Lyran signature. {0} stood outside the vehicle bay\
  \ as logistics officers moved in with crates and barcode scanners.\
  <p>"By directive of the Strategic Forces Audit Commission..." {9} read from the tablet, then lowered it. "We''re \
  done, {20}. All assets to be surrendered. Personnel to be reassigned or discharged. Our name archived."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded, silent. The bay behind them echoed with the sounds of crates being sealed, ''Meks being mothballed \
  under armed supervision. No anger. Just regulation.</p>\
  <p>"We''ll be remembered," {1} said finally.</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t look up. "The Commonwealth endures. That''s all that matters."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at the sky of {19}, still smudged with storm clouds. "Tell the techs to finish the \
  shutdown. We comply."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned, straightened {7} uniform, and walked toward the admin block - one officer in the middle of a quiet, \
  professional dismantling of the office printer.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.LA="Audit teams are on approach," {9} said, \
  closing the door to the motor pool. "Twelve hours tops. DropShip escort. Three lances of guards."\
  <p>{0} stood at the compound''s upper platform, overlooking the armor line. {6} ''Meks were already warmed \
  up. The logistics team was nowhere in sight - they''d been escorted off base two hours ago.</p>\
  <p>"They''re not getting our hardware," {1} said. "We built this unit from nothing."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "And the Commonwealth just stamped ''liability'' on our record."</p>\
  <p>{1} turned. "They call it strategic optimization. I call it cowardice."</p>\
  <p>The command center lights flickered to red. Manual lockdown confirmed.</p>\
  <p>"Everyone willing to go is already on-board," {10} said. "We won''t be popular. We won''t be legal. But we''ll \
  still have steel under our feet."</p>\
  <p>{1} glanced at the hangar one last time. "We may lose our place in their archives," {3} said, "but we won''t \
  lose \
  our name."</p>\
  <p>{18} weren''t done. Just done playing by the rules.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.LA=The mess hall was empty. {0} sat alone at one \
  of the clean steel tables as the DropShip cruised at silent speed toward its designated handoff zone.\
  <p>On-screen, the order looped calmly:</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "By directive of the Strategic Forces Audit Commission, your unit is hereby disbanded."<br>\
  "All operational assets are to be returned to Quartermaster General control."<br>\
  "Your banner will be archived. Your name will not."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered, set down a datapad. "Quartermaster''s team is prepped. They''ll board at the drop port. No \
  ceremony."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a slight nod. "They never wanted one."</p>\
  <p>{2} pulled off the unit patch and laid it flat on the table. "We kept the books balanced. We did our job."</p>\
  <p>"Until we were a paycheck they couldn''t justify."</p>\
  <p>{1} stood. "It''s over."</p>\
  <p>"Professionally," {10} added.</p>\
  <p>"Of course," {1} said, voice clipped. "That''s the Lyran way."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.LA=The DropShip had already altered course. Its registry had \
  been overwritten, its IFF transponder silent. In the hangar, techs moved fast - removing tracking nodes, wiping \
  drives, prepping {18} for vanishing.\
  <p>{0} stood on the bridge beside {9}. The stars were still, sharp, unbothered by political \
  fallout.</p>\
  <p>"HQ will flag us as rogue assets," {10} said. "They''ll seize our accounts, freeze personnel rolls."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t flinch. "Let them. We still have fuel, steel, and pilots."</p>\
  <p>{10} handed {5} a datapad. "Quiet systems. Low patrols. Plenty of work for people who don''t mind not asking \
  questions."</p>\
  <p>{1} smirked. They might not serve the Commonwealth anymore, but they would still fight. For themselves. For \
  their name.</p>
# Federated Suns
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.FS=The formal orders arrived at 06:00-Local, encoded and \
  authenticated. {0} read them without expression, then walked out into the pre-dawn gray of \
  {19}''s landing field. The wind bit at {7} collar.\
  <p>{9} was waiting, datapad in hand. "AFFS Logistics is inbound. They want everything inventoried before\
  \ local noon."</p>\
  <p>"We''ll give them clean tags and empty bays," {1} said. "They won''t find fault with our withdrawal."</p>\
  <p>{10} hesitated. "Command says our banners will be retired with respect."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a short breath - half scoff, half sigh. "That and two C-bills will buy you a drink."</p>\
  <p>Down the line, MekWarriors were already stepping away from their machines. No drama. No resistance. Just \
  resignation.</p>\
  <p>{1} unclipped the unit patch from {7} sleeve. "Tell them we comply. Completely."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "We''ll make sure the records show that we did our part."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at the sky. "The Davion flag still flies. That''s all that matters."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.FS={0} stood in front of {18}'' \
  command trailer, holding a comm unit still crackling with the disbandment order. {2} clicked it off. The wind \
  carried the silence across the compound.\
  <p>"So that''s it," {9} said beside {5}. "Article 14. Equipment seized. Personnel dismissed."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer immediately. Then: "If they want our unit, they can come take it."</p>\
  <p>{10} arched a brow. "That''s not exactly protocol, {20}."</p>\
  <p>"We followed protocol. For years. Now they''ve decided we''re a liability." {1} looked toward the hangars. "We''re \
  not laying down. Not like this."</p>\
  <p>{10} gave a slow nod. "I''ve already locked out the AFFS override codes. They won''t be disabling anything from \
  orbit."</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled, they''d worked together so long it was like {10} could read {7} mind.</p>\
  <p>"Get everyone willing to walk away ready for launch," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{18} weren''t just refusing the order - they were rewriting it.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.FS=The DropShip was quiet except for the low hum of engine \
  systems and the occasional tap of boots on deck. {0} stood in the mission planning room, staring at a \
  blank holomap.\
  <p>{9} entered, holding the AFFS disbandment communiqué. "This is it," {12} said. "We''re out. Under \
  Article 14. Orders verified."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look away from the map. "We held the line when it wasn''t convenient. We carried losses others \
  wouldn''t. And now they''re done with us."</p>\
  <p>{10} placed a tablet on the table. "Final archive of our logs. It''ll go into AFFS records. Buried, \
  probably."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a slight nod. "Let them bury it. We knew who we were."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached up, unfastened the last patch from {7} uniform, and set it gently on the console.</p>\
  <p>"It''s over," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>"And we stood to the end," {10} replied. "Even when no one else could."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.FS="You''re officially in violation of AFFS Directives," the\
  \ comm crackled.\
  <p>{0} killed the feed.</p>\
  <p>{9} stood by the door to the bridge. "We''re about 2 minutes away from jumping off-grid."</p>\
  <p>"Then we''re free," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} gave a short nod. "The registry wipe''s clean. They''ll brand us deserters."</p>\
  <p>{1} walked over to the viewport, watching the stars pass. "We didn''t desert. We survived their abandonment."</p>\
  <p>In the hangar below, {18}'' ''Meks were already being refit - patched up, ready for whatever came \
  next.</p>\
  <p>"We may not wear the Davion crest anymore," {1} said, "but we still carry steel. Still walk tall."</p>\
  <p>{10} smiled faintly. "They retired our banner with respect. I guess we''ll just have to fly a new one."</p>
# Free Worlds League
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.FWL="Directive 27-FR/Red," {9} read aloud, \
  voice clipped. "Ratified by the Captain-General''s office, endorsed by regional governors. It''s final."\
  <p>{0} stood by the depot doors as the first trucks pulled in - logistics crews under strict orders, \
  guarded by regional troops. There would be no second chances. No appeals.</p>\
  <p>"Persistent failure to meet operational objectives," {10} added. "Discipline breakdowns. Cost-to-performance \
  ratio..."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t reply. {2} was watching the technicians tag their equipment - ''Meks, munitions, even spare actuators. \
  Everything catalogued. Everything logged. The League loved its paperwork.</p>\
  <p>"We''re not even a line item anymore," {10} said quietly.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned, pulled the velcro patch from [7] arm, and set it on the nearest crate. "No. We''re surplus."</p>\
  <p>And with that, {18} became history - filed, boxed, and forgotten.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.FWL=The data relay had been cut two hours ago. No more \
  updates. No more audits. {0} stood at the edge of the launch platform, wind pushing against {7} coat.\
  <p>{9} emerged from the bunker stairwell. "Quartermaster detachment''s been diverted. They''re not even \
  trying to enforce it in person."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Why bother? We''re just a cost center to them."</p>\
  <p>Below, crews moved fast - loading munitions, rerouting coolant, locking down ''Meks. Every ton of gear they \
  didn''t abandon was another step toward independence.</p>\
  <p>"This is how the League cleans house," {10} said. "Quiet. Efficient."</p>\
  <p>"Then we''ll make some noise," {1} answered.</p>\
  <p>{2} glanced at the sky. No banners flew. Not anymore. {18} were no longer under League control. And \
  they didn''t intend to ask permission to leave.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.FWL=The cabin lights were dimmed. {0} sat at the \
  table in the crew lounge, staring at the official dissolution packet glowing on the wall display.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Directive 27-FR/Red... your unit is disbanded."<br>\
  "Performance unsustainable. Command instability."<br>\
  "The League endures. Your unit does not."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered quietly, a datafile in hand. "Depot rendezvous in sixteen hours. We hand off all \
  hardware. No exceptions."</p>\
  <p>"And the personnel?" {1} asked, voice low.</p>\
  <p>"Reassigned or dismissed based on reviews. Morale''s... frayed."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "This is what failure looks like, in the League. Not a court-martial. A memo."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into a storage drawer and pulled out the last unit insignia, slid it across the table.</p>\
  <p>{10} picked it up. "You want this logged or buried?"</p>\
  <p>"Burn it," {1} said. "They''ve already erased us from their books."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.FWL=The command codes had been wiped. Official \
  communications rerouted. The DropShip no longer reported to League drop ports. It was off-network, off-list, and \
  off-leash.\
  <p>"Directive says we''re disbanded," {9} muttered. "So we disbanded - from them."</p>\
  <p>{0} stood in the crew bay, watching {18}'' ''Meks in their repair gantries. Their painted \
  insignia had already been stripped. Not out of shame - just necessity.</p>\
  <p>"They called us a liability," {1} said. "But we''re the ones still standing."</p>\
  <p>{10} tapped {16} gauntlet. "Jobs on the periphery. Transport runs, small contracts, maybe even a pirate lord who\
  \ wants a real ''Mek company."</p>\
  <p>{1} smirked. "As long as they pay."</p>\
  <p>The ship shuddered - jump engines warming.</p>\
  <p>They weren''t soldiers anymore. But they weren''t finished. {18} had just become a private enterprise \
  - with an axe to grind.</p>
# Terran Hegemony
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.TH=The deactivation command hit every terminal on base at \
  00:00-Local. {0} stood beneath the sensor tower, eyes fixed on the base chronometer as the status bars \
  all flipped red. The shutdown had begun.\
  <p>{9} approached from the barracks, helmet tucked under one arm. "It''s official. Strategic Review \
  Protocol 9-Collapse. Effective immediately."</p>\
  <p>"Logistics confirmed?" {1} asked.</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "They''ve already reassigned our hangar space. No delay. No discussion."</p>\
  <p>The MekBay lights were cycling down - one by one, standby power cut. Subsystems locked out. Sentries offline.</p>\
  <p>"They evaluated us into extinction," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t argue. "Your logbook''s being archived under classified review."</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled the patch from {7} jacket. "No trial. No report. Just a protocol."</p>\
  <p>"And no further correspondence will be issued," {10} recited. The system had spoken. There would be no echo.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.TH=The blackout was intentional. The base dropped off the \
  communications relay twenty minutes before the Strategic Review Protocol reached its final step. Inside the hardened \
  command center, {18} were rewriting their destiny.\
  <p>"We''ve bypassed the satellite sync," {9} said. "HQ won''t get the confirmation ping."</p>\
  <p>{0} stared at the mission control panel - now a loop of blank error messages. "Then we''ve already \
  broken protocol."</p>\
  <p>Outside, MekTechs were overriding internal lockdowns. Subsystems purged. Pilots were sealing into cockpits \
  like it was wartime.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll erase our name," {10} said. "Wipe us like a bug in a program."</p>\
  <p>"Let them," {1} said. "But we''ll still be running - outside their parameters."</p>\
  <p>The generator rumbled as the backup fusion core engaged. {19}''s sky turned violet with dawn and \
  defiance.</p>\
  <p>"We don''t need a system to validate our existence," {1} muttered. "Just a way out."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.TH=The ship''s command terminal displayed the final review \
  order in grayscale. {0} sat motionless as it cycled through the closure checklist:\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit: {18}."<br>\
  "Directive: Strategic Review Protocol 9-Collapse."<br>\
  "Status: Dissolved."<br>\
  "Historical logbook: Archived - Classified Access."<br>\
  "Future correspondence: None."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} stepped onto the bridge. "Inventory purge complete. Logistics confirms reabsorption of all \
  digital assets. They''re already issuing our gear to new commands."</p>\
  <p>"No citation. No commendation," {1} said. "Just erased."</p>\
  <p>{10} handed {5} a tablet. "Local copy of our full mission history. Technically illegal."</p>\
  <p>{1} accepted it without a word. {2} stood, placed the unit insignia on the command panel, and let the ship lights\
  \ dim around them.</p>\
  <p>"They ended our story with a database flag," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>"We still have the memories," {10} replied.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look back. The silence lingered around {7} neck like a noose.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.TH=The Hegemony expected compliance. The DropShip did not \
  oblige.\
  <p>{0} stood on the command deck, watching as {9} completed the last overwrite. The DropShip''s\
  transponder now identified it as a common cargo hauler. Every data link to the Hegemony had been severed, scrubbed, \
  and replaced.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll dispatch enforcement units once they realize the protocol failed," {10} said. "But we''ll be long \
  gone."</p>\
  <p>"What''s our JumpPath?" {1} asked.</p>\
  <p>{10} showed a star map. "Pirate points. No tracking."</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled. "No more directives. No more protocols. Just us."</p>\
  <p>"They''ll pretend we miss-jumped. Died," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{10} smiled. "Then we''ll show them what ghosts can do."</p>
# Republic of the Sphere
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.ROS=The wind blew dust across the compound''s parade \
  ground, rustling the edge of the Republic banner where it still hung. {0} stood in the center of the \
  staging platform, datapad in hand. The official transmission blinked quietly:\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Your unit is to be officially disbanded, effective immediately."<br>\
  "Unacceptable casualty ratios. Operational collapse. Report for reassignment."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} approached, reading the same orders on {16} own screen. "Oversight Council reviewed our last six \
  ops. Says our breakdowns jeopardized allied cohesion."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "So we''re the cost of their course correction."</p>\
  <p>Behind them, techs began disengaging gear from the ''Meks. A surgical dismantling. No shouting. No ceremony.</p>\
  <p>"They expect orderly dissolution," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll get it," {1} replied. "Just don''t expect a speech."</p>\
  <p>{2} removed {18} insignia from {7} collar and dropped it into the equipment bin without a glance. The\
  \ Republic endured - but not everyone was invited to serve.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.ROS=The Republic expected quiet compliance. What it got \
  was a blackout.\
  <p>{0} stood in the command tower as comms cut across all channels. {2} could see ''Mek crews below, still \
  moving with precision. Still loyal.</p>\
  <p>"We''ve got Republic logistics rerouted. Their recovery team won''t land without secure coordinates," {9} \
  reported. "And we deleted those five minutes ago."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s face remained calm. "No threat in their tone. Just disappointment."</p>\
  <p>"We''re not collapsing," {10} said. "We''re detaching."</p>\
  <p>{18}'' DropShip was already fueling. Reinforced hardpoints. Fresh codes. They wouldn''t be Republic \
  anymore - but they''d still fly.</p>\
  <p>"They told us to assist in an orderly dissolution," {1} said. "Technically, we are."</p>\
  <p>{10} raised a brow. "Just not theirs."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.ROS=The crew lounge was dark but functional. {0} \
  sat at a side table, fingers steepled under {7} chin. A holo projected the Republic''s final ruling in front of \
  {5}.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "All personnel will be reassigned. All military hardware is to be returned."<br>\
  "The Republic survives not by holding on to the broken."<br>\
  "Assist in an orderly dissolution."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} stood beside the galley counter. "Our gear''s been tagged for surrender at the next transit hub. \
  Command says we''ll be given favorable placements."</p>\
  <p>{1} tilted {7} head slightly. "We were assets. Now we''re components to redistribute."</p>\
  <p>"The Republic survives," {10} said softly.</p>\
  <p>{1} reached into {7} coat and pulled free the last fabric version of their unit insignia. {2} didn''t say anything\
  \ - just folded it twice and set it down on the table.</p>\
  <p>"It survives," {1} echoed. "But we won''t be there to see it."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.ROS=The official message had arrived an hour ago. The \
  DropShip was already off-course, engines burning toward a pirate point not listed on any Republic chart.\
  <p>{0} stood on the upper deck, watching the stars wheel past. {9} entered behind {5}, calm as\
  \ ever.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll mark us as noncompliant," {10} said. "Not criminal. Just inefficient."</p>\
  <p>"We were never criminals," {1} replied. "We followed orders until the orders turned us into footnotes."</p>\
  <p>In the hangar, their ''Meks were being refit for a life without regulation. Stolen coolant, salvaged munitions, \
  painted-over ID codes.</p>\
  <p>"They say the Republic survives by letting go of the broken," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t flinch. "Then we''ll prove we still work."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the nav computer finished calculating the distance between them and the JumpShip they hired. {18} had no\
  \ banner, no budget, and no backing.</p>\
  <p>But they were still moving. Still armed. Still dangerous.</p>
# Star League
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.SL=The final order was delivered on an SLDF-secured \
  channel. No commentary. No apology. Just protocol.\
  <p>{0} stood on the drill field as logistics personnel began their sweep through the motor pool. \
  Everything was tagged for reclamation: vehicles, ''Meks, even uniforms.</p>\
  <p>{9} stood beside {5}, formal posture, voice neutral. "Protocol 5-Bravo. We''ve been deactivated."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They archived our designation?"</p>\
  <p>{10} checked {16} pad. "Stricken from the rolls. Combat ineffectiveness. Doctrinal deviation. Leadership \
  failure."</p>\
  <p>The SLDF didn''t just remove. It erased.</p>\
  <p>{1} peeled the unit patch from {7} jacket, staring at the faded insignia. "So that''s how it ends."</p>\
  <p>{10} responded with the only thing that mattered. "Service noted. Record ends now."</p>\
  <p>{18} were no longer soldiers. They were just statistics waiting for consolidation.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.SL=The SLDF wanted clean compliance. They received \
  encryption breaks and shut-down refusals.\
  <p>{0} moved through the bunker with silent urgency. The message from Command - Protocol 5-Bravo - had \
  been received and immediately rerouted to cold storage.</p>\
  <p>"They''ve ordered a full seizure," {9} said. "''Meks, gear, even our comms deck."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t blink. "Let them try."</p>\
  <p>Down below, engineering teams were bypassing the lockouts. Fusion cores whined as ''Meks booted without SLDF \
  authorization.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll purge our name," {10} said. "No unit, no history, no record."</p>\
  <p>{1} glanced up at the holographic unit roster. With a flick of {7} fingers, {3} deleted it manually.</p>\
  <p>"Then they won''t have to bother."</p>\
  <p>{18} wouldn''t go quietly. And if the League wanted silence, they''d have to earn it.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.SL=The command deck of the DropShip was quiet. The order \
  had come through encrypted, impersonal, absolute.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit designation ''{18}'' is to be deactivated and dissolved under Protocol 5-Bravo."<br>\
  "All ''Meks, supplies, and command assets are to be surrendered for redistribution."<br>\
  "Your service is noted. This record ends now."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stared at the screen for a long time. {9} entered, voice level. "Personnel have been \
  reassigned. Our ''Meks are being prepped for handover."</p>\
  <p>"No hearings?" {1} asked.</p>\
  <p>"No. Not even an audit. The logbook''s going to classified storage."</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled off {7} unit insignia. "We did everything by the book."</p>\
  <p>"And the book has no space left for us."</p>\
  <p>{1} placed the insignia on the center table. Not out of reverence. Just to leave something behind.</p>\
  <p>"SLDF erasure," {3} said. "Efficient as ever."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.SL=The DropShip was no longer connected to SLDF central \
  routing. {0} stood on the upper deck, arms crossed, eyes locked on the growing starfield ahead.\
  <p>"Nav net says we''re out of beacon range," {9} said. "We''ve ghosted the registry. No one''s coming after us - \
  yet."</p>\
  <p>"They wanted a perfect system," {1} replied. "No errors. No exceptions."</p>\
  <p>In the hangar, engineers worked in silence - stripping SLDF codes, rearming with stolen weapons, wiping every \
  serial number. Every trace.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll call us rogue," {10} said. "They''ll erase our name."</p>\
  <p>"Then we''ll build one that can''t be deleted."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the JumpShip thrummed as translation prep finished. {18} were out. No banner. No roll call. \
  No record.</p>\
  <p>Only memory. And vengeance.</p>\
  <p>They jumped.</p>
# Federated Commonwealth
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.FC=The message came via a triple-authenticated comm burst \
  - high clearance, high formality. {0} stood by the forward observation wall, listening to the playback.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Pursuant to Operation Sunset Protocol, your unit is hereby deactivated and dissolved, effective immediately."<br>\
  "Persistent failure. Loss of strategic value. Deterioration in command stability."<br>\
  "Your banner will be archived, but it will not fly again."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered, datapad in hand. "Quartermaster transport is inbound. They''ve already logged our entire \
  depot manifest."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t turn. "And the personnel?"</p>\
  <p>"Reassignment orders filed for half. Other half gets cut loose."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They always did talk about rebuilding stronger."</p>\
  <p>{10} walked to the center of the room and placed a box on the table - {18}'' regimental insignia \
  inside, sealed in glass.</p>\
  <p>And outside, the ''Meks powered down for the last time.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.FC=The official transmission sat unread in the system \
  buffer. {0} stood in the armory while techs armed the very systems they were supposed to be surrendering.\
  <p>"They want a quiet shutdown," {9} said. "They didn''t send anyone in person. Just logistics codes and a \
  calendar."</p>\
  <p>"They''re used to people obeying," {1} replied. "They don''t know what to do with someone who won''t."</p>\
  <p>Outside, crews loaded DropShips with live ordnance. Anything not nailed down was coming with them.</p>\
  <p>{1} walked to the command panel and keyed in the final lockdown override. "They said our banner would never fly \
  again," {3} said. "Let''s prove them wrong."</p>\
  <p>Above, the skies over {19} began to glow with heat plumes. And {18} prepared to vanish \
  on their own terms.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.FC=The DropShip floated in a system-neutral drift, waiting \
  for landing clearance at a secure FedCom depot.\
  <p>{0} sat in the mission chair as the final order played again across the console screen.</p>\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Operation Sunset Protocol. Your unit has been deemed unviable."<br>\
  "All materiel is to be surrendered to Quartermaster Command. Personnel to report for reassignment."<br>\
  "Your banner will be archived, but it will not fly again."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} entered, setting a sealed archive container on the console. "Our final report''s in. They won''t \
  challenge it."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked down at the empty insignia patch on {7} sleeve. "No one fights for the archive."</p>\
  <p>"We don''t need to," {10} replied. "We served. It''s done."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded slowly. "Then let the history books decide if we mattered."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.FC=The jump was computed without pinging Commonwealth \
  systems. Their new heading, a pirate point rendezvous - uncharted, unapproved, and very much unauthorized.\
  <p>{0} stood beside the forward viewport, watching stars rotate slowly outside. Behind {5}, {9} reviewed alternate \
  nav paths, all off-record.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll write us off as an operational failure," {10} said. "No loss. Just... removed."</p>\
  <p>"And we''ll give them reason to regret that," {1} replied.</p>\
  <p>In the bay, ''Mek crews were scrubbing registry codes. {18} were no longer official. They were \
  something else now. Something unchained.</p>\
  <p>"They say our banner will never fly again," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned, eyes calm. "Then we''ll stitch a new one."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip''s lights shifted to combat red. And {18} jumped - into their next life.</p>
# Periphery
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.periphery=The shutdown order was short. Brutal. Delivered \
  over an unsecured channel.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "No salvage. No cohesion. No victories."<br>\
  "We don''t have the resources to prop up broken units."<br>\
  "Your flag comes down today."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood outside the bunkhouse as the message echoed from every loudspeaker on base. Around {5}, \
  soldiers moved slowly, confused but not surprised.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached, hauling a crate of sealed weapons. "They''re not even coming to pick it up. Just said \
  to leave it stacked for redistribution."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Or scavengers."</p>\
  <p>The unit''s banner had already been pulled down and folded into a supply bag. It would not be hoisted again.</p>\
  <p>"They didn''t even say ''thank you,''" {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>"They don''t have to," {1} replied. "They said, "you''re done" and that''s all they meant."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.periphery=The comms were dark. Power rerouted to internal \
  systems. Outside, the field was active - engineers rushing to load the last remaining gear. They weren''t waiting \
  for permission.\
  <p>{0} stood near the depot gate, arms crossed as {9} returned from the perimeter.</p>\
  <p>"Their last message was clear," {10} said. "We''re on our own."</p>\
  <p>"We always were," {1} answered. "They just finally admitted it."</p>\
  <p>They could hear a fusion engine spooling up in the distance. The DropShip was almost ready. And no one was coming \
  to stop them.</p>\
  <p>"They said they wouldn''t waste fuel pulling our teeth," {10} said. "Guess they forgot we still have claws."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a half-smile. "Then let''s bite something on the way out."</p>\
  <p>{18} weren''t being abandoned. They were breaking out.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.periphery=The display terminal was cracked. The \
  transmission quality degraded. But the message had gotten through:\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "No salvage. No cohesion. No victories."<br>\
  "We don''t owe you a second chance."<br>\
  "Your flag comes down today."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat in the auxiliary bay, watching techs prepare their last functioning ''Mek for mothballing.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered, shaking {16} head. "The rest of the crew''s been offered open contracts or a fast ride \
  off-world. No one''s waiting for orders."</p>\
  <p>"Because there aren''t any," {1} said flatly. "We''ve been written off."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into a side pouch and withdrew their old insignia patch - creased, cracked, soaked with coolant \
  stains.</p>\
  <p>{2} screwed it up and dropped it into the ship''s incinerator chute. A final, pointless act of defiance.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.periphery=Engines flared. Coordinates scrubbed. The \
  nav computer showed no registry alignment. {18} were flying clean - off the books, off the leash.\
  <p>{0} stood in the loading deck, watching crews affix stripped ID panels to unregistered plating. Their \
  ''Meks no longer had names. Only firepower.</p>\
  <p>"Command said we weren''t worth the fuel," {9} said. "Guess we found our own."</p>\
  <p>{1} checked the sealed supply manifest. "They gave us nothing. We kept everything."</p>\
  <p>The comms bay pinged - outside contract offers already appearing from pirate outposts, freelance militias, and a\
  \ dozen gray-zone buyers who didn''t care about official status.</p>\
  <p>"So what now?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} smirked. "Now we find someone who''s desperate enough to pay us what we''re worth - and stupid enough to think\
  \ they can own us."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip jumped. No banners. No allegiance. Just guns, grit, and freedom.</p>
# Rim Worlds Republic
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.RWR=The orders came sealed and encrypted. By the time they\
  \ were opened, it was already too late to protest.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Operational effectiveness has collapsed."<br>\
  "Loyalty is questionable."<br>\
  "Losses are unsustainable."<br>\
  "There will be no ceremony. You''re not worthy of the honor."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood at the edge of the platform, watching Republic agents tag personnel for screening. No one \
  made eye contact. Everyone moved fast. Quiet. Scared.</p>\
  <p>{9} stood near the armory doors. "They''ve divided the roster. Command officers are flagged for \
  detainment."</p>\
  <p>"Expected," {1} muttered. "It was never about performance. Just control."</p>\
  <p>{2} looked down at {7} hands - callused from years of service.</p>\
  <p>{10} offered nothing. No comfort. Just facts. "This is a purge. And we''re lucky we got this far."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded, removed the unit insignia from {7} collar, and dropped it into a waste bin already full of rank pins\
  \ and shredded patches. The Republic didn''t want soldiers. It wanted obedience.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.RWR=The internal surveillance node was fried. Comms were \
  down. And every trace of Republic command structure had been wiped from the local net.\
  <p>{0} stood in the control room, watching static pour across the screens. {9} finished \
  locking out the last override scripts.</p>\
  <p>"They wanted us gone," {10} said. "Now we''re ghosts."</p>\
  <p>"Not yet," {1} replied. "They''ll come to finish the job. That''s how they work."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the crew was prepping ''Meks under blackout conditions - no IDs, no IFF pings, no lights. Just silence and\
  \ steel.</p>\
  <p>"We''ve loaded what we can," {10} said. "Once we launch, we vanish. No network, no trace."</p>\
  <p>{1} picked up the old unit crest, held it for a long moment, then crushed it in {7} palm. "The Republic says \
  we''re not worth remembering."</p>\
  <p>{2} let the patch fall. "So we''ll make them regret forgetting us."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.RWR=The deactivation notice was already cycling on the wall\
  \ screen when {0} stepped into the forward corridor.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "As of this transmission, your unit is disbanded by order of the High Military Directorate."<br>\
  "Surviving officers will be reassigned or detained based on loyalty assessments."<br>\
  "There will be no ceremony."<br>\
  "You''re not worthy of the honor."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{9} leaned against the wall, arms folded. "Loyalty scan packets went out three hours ago. We''re all \
  flagged as compromised."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t flinch. "So this was never about fixing anything."</p>\
  <p>"Just pruning the tree."</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled the unit patch from {7} jacket and dropped it into the recycler. "No point holding onto symbols \
  they''ve already burned."</p>\
  <p>The ship drifted. {18} weren''t being reassigned - they were being buried.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.RWR=The ship ran dark. No signals. No transponder. The nav \
  computer had been wiped and reprogrammed in the last two hours.\
  <p>{0} stared at the flickering tactical map - unlabeled systems, pirate worlds, blank space. {2} didn''t \
  need coordinates anymore. Just distance.</p>\
  <p>{9} keyed the final purge command into the ship''s command module. "We''re out of Republic space. \
  They''ll brand us as insurgents."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They were going to erase us either way. At least now we get to decide what we do next."</p>\
  <p>In the hold, crews moved fast - stripping identifiers, mounting stolen gear, prepping ''Meks for combat with no \
  colors, no allegiance.</p>\
  <p>"They said we weren''t worthy of the honor," {10} said quietly.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned toward {14}. "Then we fight for something else. Something that doesn''t lie to our faces."</p>\
  <p>The attached JumpShip flickered and then flashed. And {18} disappeared into the unknown, not to hide\
  \ - but to survive out of spite.</p>
# Taurian Concordat
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.TC=The order came in via hardline: brief, direct, and \
  absolute.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "By order of the TDF Strategic Reorganization Office, your unit is disbanded, effective immediately."<br>\
  "Sustained underperformance. Command breakdowns. Morale incompatible with Taurian standards."<br>\
  "No ceremony will be held. Your banner will be archived. Let history judge the rest."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the motor pool as the unit''s banner was removed from the wall and folded into storage. No\
  \ speeches. Just quiet movements and clipped commands.</p>\
  <p>{9} reported in. "Quartermaster lists confirmed. Personnel routed to regional HQs. Equipment''s being \
  loaded for turnover."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t respond. {2} was watching the last ''Mek get powered down, cockpit open and exposed - like a carcass \
  waiting for parts to be stripped.</p>\
  <p>"They expect us to vanish without noise," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"We will," {1} replied. "That''s what''s expected."</p>\
  <p>And that was all the TDF needed to hear.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.TC=The Concordat order had arrived, but no one \
  acknowledged it. {18} weren''t done - not yet.\
  <p>{0} stood in the hangar while techs hardwired override commands into stripped-down Taurian operating \
  systems. {9} returned from the outer perimeter, helmet under {16} arm.</p>\
  <p>"HQ hasn''t followed up. No patrols. They assume we''ll comply," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded slowly. "That''s their mistake."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the DropShip was warming engines. On the tarmac, crews loaded crates under blackout conditions. No \
  ceremony. No pride. Just necessity.</p>\
  <p>"They said history will judge us," {1} muttered.</p>\
  <p>"Then let''s make sure history has something to judge," {10} replied.</p>\
  <p>{18} weren''t breaking ranks. They were walking away from a flag that no longer had room for them.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.TC=The order played once and then locked itself from \
  playback - standard Taurian protocol. No point in hearing it again.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit disbanded."<br>\
  "Assets surrendered."<br>\
  "Banner archived."<br>\
  "Let history judge the rest."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat at a narrow galley table, watching empty seats around {5}. The rest of the crew had either \
  been reassigned or chosen to leave before they were ordered to.</p>\
  <p>{9} entered with the last of the data backups. "They''ve voided our contracts. No retention bonus. No \
  pension review."</p>\
  <p>{1} offered a flat smile. "Efficiency. A Taurian virtue."</p>\
  <p>{2} placed the final patch - frayed, sun-bleached - into a disposable bag. "We''ll be a footnote in a logbook \
  somewhere."</p>\
  <p>{10} shrugged. "At least they didn''t lie about it."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.TC=The DropShip''s route had already deviated. No one spoke \
  it aloud, but everyone aboard knew what they were doing.\
  <p>{0} stood on the upper deck overlooking the hangar. Down below, {18}'' ''Meks were being \
  reconfigured - new codes, stripped serials, IFFs tweaked to fool Republic sensors.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached. "No recall. No threats. Just silence. They''re letting us go."</p>\
  <p>"They don''t need to chase us," {1} said. "They''ve already written us off."</p>\
  <p>"And we''re fine with that?"</p>\
  <p>{1} turned to {14}, calm. "I''m fine with surviving. We''ve served long enough to know when it''s time to stop \
  asking permission."</p>\
  <p>The nav computer blinked green. The next jump wouldn''t be on any TDF-approved map. {18} had left the\
  \ Concordat - but not the fight.</p>
# Magistracy of Canopus
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.MOC=The order was clear, calm, and final.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "By order of the Strategic Readiness Council, your unit is dissolved and removed from the active roster of the \
  Magistracy Armed Forces."<br>\
  "This decision reflects a prolonged record of underperformance, logistical dysfunction, and failure to meet \
  readiness standards."<br>\
  "May it serve as a reminder - not of failure, but of the consequences of failing to adapt."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} watched the comms screen go dark, then lowered the datapad with deliberate care. Outside, support \
  staff were already loading the last equipment into lock crates.</p>\
  <p>{9} walked across the hangar floor. "They''re not angry. They''re just... done with us."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Evolution is policy. We didn''t keep up."</p>\
  <p>{10} gestured to the storage bay, where the unit banner was being carefully folded - not burned, not torn. \
  Archived.</p>\
  <p>"At least they gave us a footnote," {1} said. "Could''ve been worse."</p>\
  <p>"Could''ve been silence," {10} agreed.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.MOC=The order was received - and quietly deleted.\
  <p>{0} stood beside the stripped-down launchpad, arms crossed, watching the engineers retrofit ''Meks with\
  \ salvaged IFFs. This wasn''t rebellion. It was reinvention.</p>\
  <p>"Strategic Readiness Council says we didn''t evolve," {10} said, handing over the final diagnostic slate.</p>\
  <p>{1} smirked. "They''re not wrong. But that doesn''t mean we stop moving."</p>\
  <p>Outside, dust and fuel heat shimmered in the air. No escort was inbound. No one was coming to stop them.</p>\
  <p>"They said our banner belongs in the archive," {10} said. "So we''ll just have to hang it somewhere else."</p>\
  <p>{1} checked {7} sidearm, holstered it, and gave a nod. "We don''t have to be part of the future. We just have to \
  survive it."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip engines roared to life. Adaptation wasn''t granted. It was taken.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.MOC=The mission terminal displayed the official notice in \
  its signature Canopian formatting - concise, dignified, irrefutable.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Dissolution effective immediately."<br>\
  "Performance metrics unmet. Readiness standards breached."<br>\
  "Let the record serve as a reminder to all commands."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat beside the forward console. {9} entered with a small, sealed case - the last \
  logbook, physical and encrypted.</p>\
  <p>"Their tone was almost polite," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"It''s the Magistracy," {1} replied. "We''re not Taurians."</p>\
  <p>{2} pulled off the last insignia on {7} sleeve and tucked it into the case. "Our relevance expired."</p>\
  <p>"But not our record," {10} said. "They''ll remember us."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a quiet nod. "That''s more than some get."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.MOC=The internal comms system buzzed once, then fell \
  silent. No new orders. No requests. Only space and the sound of life-support systems ticking like a mechanical \
  heartbeat.\
  <p>{0} stood over the central nav computer, recalibrating their heading by hand. They were no longer part\
  \ of the Magistracy''s future.</p>\
  <p>"They won''t chase us," {9} said, entering beside two armed guards. "They''ll just let the silence erase us."</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "Then we make noise somewhere else."</p>\
  <p>Below, {18}'' gear was already being refitted - no Magistracy markings, no identifiers. Just \
  firepower. Freedom.</p>\
  <p>"They said failure to adapt has consequences," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>{1} glanced at {14}. "Good. That means adapting has consequences too."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip shifted course. Their next jump wouldn''t be legal, but it would be theirs. {18} weren''t \
  done. Not yet.</p>
# Outworlds Alliance
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.OA=The message was unsigned, but unmistakably official.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Your unit is formally deactivated and removed from the Alliance Military Corps registry."<br>\
  "This action is taken due to consistent underperformance, command instability, and deteriorating operational \
  capacity."<br>\
  "This unit''s service is acknowledged. Its conduct must not be repeated."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the central yard, boots coated in dust, watching supply clerks seal up crates of gear for \
  collection. Nothing dramatic. Just quiet bureaucracy.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached with a personnel slate. "They''ve processed us. Half the unit''s already reassigned. The\
  \ rest are... on their own."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a shallow nod. "They won''t make a speech. But we were still theirs once."</p>\
  <p>{10} looked down. "They expected better."</p>\
  <p>"So did I," {1} said. And turned away before the silence could answer back.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.OA=No alarms. No lockdowns. Just a mutual decision to \
  ignore the order.\
  <p>{0} stood at the hangar bay doors as ''Mek crews worked quietly under low lights. Not rebellious. \
  Just... moving forward.</p>\
  <p>"HQ hasn''t followed up," {9} reported. "Probably won''t. They have too few ASF assets, too few officers, and too \
  many things to pretend aren''t breaking."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They''ve released us."</p>\
  <p>Engines spun up in the distance. No one gave the order aloud. Everyone simply understood.</p>\
  <p>"They said our conduct must not be repeated," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s eyes narrowed. "Then we''ll do something new."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip''s thrusters began to glow. No broadcast. No protest. Just departure.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.OA=The nav computer still showed their old Alliance routes,\
  \ but the overlay was grayed out now. Redacted. Deauthorized.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "As of this moment, your unit is deactivated and removed from the Alliance Military Corps registry."<br>\
  "Operational capacity no longer meets minimum requirements."<br>\
  "This unit''s service is acknowledged. Its conduct must not be repeated."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat quietly beside the systems console. {9} entered with a soft footfall, holding the \
  last filed report in {7} hands.</p>\
  <p>"We weren''t the worst," {10} said. "Just... no longer useful."</p>\
  <p>{1} took the report and placed it into the archive bin.</p>\
  <p>{10} sat beside {5}. "Could be worse."</p>\
  <p>"Could be easier," {1} said.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.OA=The nav lights dimmed as the DropShip cleared the last \
  Alliance beacon. There was no pursuit. No warning. No goodbye.\
  <p>{0} stood near the forward viewport, watching the stars twist as the new vector came online. No \
  destination filed. Just out.</p>\
  <p>{9} adjusted the systems panel. "They released us. Didn''t revoke our weapons. Didn''t even ask us to \
  check in."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "That''s how they say good luck."</p>\
  <p>In the hangar, MekTechs were running combat drills with stripped IFF tags. No livery. No oath. Just readiness.</p>\
  <p>"So what now?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} shrugged. "Now we''re free. Let''s see what that actually means."</p>\
  <p>Somewhere, the Alliance might remember them. But not today. And certainly not by name.</p>
# Marian Hegemony
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.MH=The order was carved into the official communiqué with \
  the severity of a death sentence.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Effective this day, by command of the Caesar and with the authority of the Supreme Legate, {18} is \
  disbanded."<br>\
  "Repeated failures in combat readiness, strategic execution, and morale preservation have rendered this legion \
  unfit for continued service."<br>\
  "You will not march again under our banner."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood rigid in the center of the courtyard as Legion auditors marked off crates and locked down \
  hangars. No troops saluted. No flags flew. Not anymore.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached, {16} voice flat. "Disarmament complete. Personnel reassignment begins within the hour.\
  \ Officers reviewed for potential conscription - or dismissal."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out over the field. "They said the Republic remembers its champions... and its failures."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded grimly. "Today we''re the latter."</p>\
  <p>{1} unclipped the unit insignia and dropped it into the mud. No one picked it up.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.MH=The orders were rejected without ceremony. Burned, not \
  filed. {0} stood at the rally platform, stripped of insignia, but not command.\
  <p>"They''ve marked us unfit," {9} said. "Unworthy. They expect shame. Obedience."</p>\
  <p>"Then they''ve forgotten who we are," {1} growled. "We are {18}. Not slaves."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip was already prepping for launch. Her crews worked fast, covering old markings with flat-gray primer \
  and rearming without quartermaster approval.</p>\
  <p>"We don''t need their banner," {1} said. "We only need the will to walk away."</p>\
  <p>{10} checked {16} weapon. "They''ll send someone. A reminder. A punishment."</p>\
  <p>"Then let them," {1} replied. "We won''t be on this world when they arrive."</p>\
  <p>One more launch. One more march. This time, under no one''s heel.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.MH=The message was short. Brutal. Final.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "You are disbanded."<br>\
  "You will not march again."<br>\
  "The Republic remembers its champions - and its failures."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stared at the transmission log. No appeals. No protocol. Just exile.</p>\
  <p>{9} sat nearby, helmet resting on the bench beside {5}. "They''re pulling our personnel. The ones they\
  \ don''t conscript, they''ll blacklist."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a dry chuckle. "No trial. Just disposal."</p>\
  <p>{2} unpinned the unit badge from {7} chest and tossed it onto the table. "Let them erase our name. It won''t stop \
  us from remembering who we were."</p>\
  <p>"The Caesar sees only results," {10} muttered. "We''re just the latest casualty."</p>\
  <p>{1} leaned back. "Et tu, Caesar..."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.MH=By the time the Hegemony''s comms teams sent follow-ups, \
  {18} were already off-network - jumped out, scrubbed clean, and fully loaded.\
  <p>{0} paced the central deck, boots echoing against steel as {9} reviewed fuel reserves and \
  JumpShip options.</p>\
  <p>"They branded us failures," {10} said. "Stripped our rank. Told us we''d never march again."</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled without humor. "Then it''s time we marched where they can''t follow."</p>\
  <p>In the cargo hold, crews reloaded weapons with off-book munitions. No colors. No formal allegiance. Just \
  readiness.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll remember our absence," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>"Or regret our return," {1} answered.</p>\
  <p>Engines engaged. The DropShip vanished into the void, trailing behind it nothing but the dust of a broken oath - \
  and the spark of something reborn.</p>
# Tortuga Dominions
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.TD=The disbandment order didn''t come through secure \
  channels. It was broadcast. Public. Mocking.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "You''re done."<br>\
  "You lost multiple raids, let captives escape, and left salvage on the field."<br>\
  "You''re a disgrace to the Dominions and a waste of good guns."<br>\
  "Your banner''s ashes will be scattered in the garbage chute. That''s all the ceremony you''ve earned."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the middle of a shattered barracks compound, surrounded by silence and scorn. No one was \
  coming to collect the remains. No one cared enough to strip the place bare.</p>\
  <p>{9} kicked over an empty ammo crate. "Quartermaster pulled the plug already. We''re lucky they didn''t \
  send executioners."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked down at {7} sidearm, then at the handful of soldiers still milling around. "No orders. No salvage. No\
  \ reason to stay."</p>\
  <p>"No one left to disappoint either," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>{1} spat into the dust. "We''re not being disbanded. We''re being thrown out with the scraps."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.TD=The laughter on the open comms was loud, jeering, and \
  constant. The Dominions had made it clear: {18} weren''t worth bullets.\
  <p>{0} stalked the launch bay as fuel lines locked in place and cargo nets were cinched around crates of \
  reclaimed gear.</p>\
  <p>"They said we''re garbage," {9} said. "So we leave before they dump us."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s voice was low and dangerous. "We might be garbage - but we''re still armed."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the crews worked with the focus of cornered animals. What couldn''t be taken was torched. What was left \
  behind would burn.</p>\
  <p>"No honor, no flag, no pay," {10} said. "Just a name they already forgot."</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled. "Then we make sure they remember what it cost to throw us away."</p>\
  <p>The last lock clamped down. Engines ignited. {18} weren''t retreating - they were escaping.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.TD=The comm recording looped one last time and cut out with\
  \ a static buzz. No closing line. Just contempt.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "You''re a disgrace to the Dominions and a waste of good guns."<br>\
  "Your banner''s ashes will be scattered in the garbage chute."<br>\
  "That''s all the ceremony you''ve earned."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} slumped in a maintenance bay, watching the unit patch in {7} palm curl under the heat.</p>\
  <p>{9} tossed down a bag of stripped tags. "They''re not hunting us. Not worth it."</p>\
  <p>"They think we''re broken," {1} said. "That we''ll eat each other in a week."</p>\
  <p>{10} sat across from {7}. "They might be right."</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "Not yet."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached over, lit the patch on fire, and watched it turn to ash.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.TD=The engines were hot. Transponders were dead. Every \
  legal registry had been wiped within an hour of lift-off. There hadn''t been many. The Dominions were hardily big on\
  \ legality.\
  <p>{0} stood in the forward loading bay, watching crews round up the last of those who refused to join \
  their exodus.</p>\
  <p>"They wanted us gone," {9} said. "Said we were a waste of guns."</p>\
  <p>{1} grinned, wolfish. "Guess we''ll prove them right - by making those guns sing."</p>\
  <p>There was no plan. No destination. Just a course set for a place where the Dominion could''t reach and grudges \
  lasted generations.</p>\
  <p>"We don''t owe anyone," {10} muttered. "Not anymore."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked down at the deck plating, then up at the black beyond the viewport. "No banner. No rules. No \
  masters."</p>\
  <p>{18} hadn''t been disbanded. They had been loosed.</p>
# ComStar
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.CS=The directive came through a monochrome terminal, \
  encoded in ritual phrasing and sterile syntax.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "This message serves as formal notice that {18} is hereby disbanded, effective immediately."<br>\
  "This decision follows extensive review of combat effectiveness, chain-of-command breakdowns, and mission failure rates."<br>\
  "Your uniforms, insignia, and call signs are to be surrendered upon arrival."<br>\
  "You have served under the shadow of the Word. Let what follows be defined by a return to clarity."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} removed {7} rank sash and folded it in silence. All around {5}, personnel moved with quiet \
  obedience. No shouting. No blame. Just the hum of dissolution.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached with a datapad. "Transport requests processed. Everyone''s being reassigned or returned\
  \ to study and reflection."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a single nod. "The Word has spoken."</p>\
  <p>"And it no longer includes us," {10} replied.</p>\
  <p>{18} would not be punished. They would be forgotten.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.CS=The disbandment order was deleted without discussion. \
  In its place: sealed launch logs, rearmed ''Meks, and final rituals performed without sanction.\
  <p>{0} stood beside the temple gate as engineers silently replaced ComStar insignias with blank metal \
  plates.</p>\
  <p>"We are outside doctrine now," {9} said, offering a final manifest. "Unblessed. Unrecorded."</p>\
  <p>"So be it," {1} replied. "If the Word no longer sees us, we write our own Truth."</p>\
  <p>Their departure would not be broadcast. The DropShip would lift silently, without escort, without liturgy.</p>\
  <p>"They warned us not to repeat our conduct," {10} said.</p>\
  <p>{1} looked skyward. "Then we''ll act by instinct, not decree."</p>\
  <p>The Word had turned away. {18} had not.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.CS=The communiqué displayed one last time before erasing \
  itself from the logs.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Your unit has been deemed incompatible with current operational standards."<br>\
  "Report for reassignment, discharge, or retraining at the nearest ComGuard facility."<br>\
  "You have served under the shadow of the Word. Let what follows be defined by a return to clarity."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} sat quietly in the crew bay. The lighting had dimmed, and even the usual comms chatter had gone \
  still.</p>\
  <p>{9} took the seat beside {5}. "They''ve archived our combat logs. Sanitized the record."</p>\
  <p>{1} traced a finger over the blank space where the unit''s emblem used to be. "Cleansing, they call it."</p>\
  <p>"Closure," {10} added. "But it feels like deletion."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t argue. {2} simply sat, quiet, and let the silence settle in like a benediction.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.CS=There were no prayers, no affirmations, no chanting \
  through the ship''s speakers. ComStar had ceased contact. The Word was withdrawn.\
  <p>{0} stood over the nav computer, plotting an unauthorized vector towards an independent JumpShip.</p>\
  <p>"The Word says we are to be forgotten," {9} said. "But memory is not so easily erased."</p>\
  <p>{1} watched the jump sequence engage. "They revoked our clearance. Not our capability."</p>\
  <p>In the cargo bay, ''Meks stood silent and ready - unadorned, unacknowledged, but still lethal.</p>\
  <p>"We''re rogue," {10} said. "Shadow without source."</p>\
  <p>"Then w are not lost. Just unblessed," {1} replied.</p>\
  <p>{18} had left the Word behind - but not their purpose.</p>
# Word of Blake
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.WOB=The transmission came without encryption. Just purity.\
  \ And finality.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "{18} has been found guilty of systemic doctrinal drift, insufficient battlefield execution, and poor \
  integration with wider faith operations."<br>\
  "Effective immediately, your unit is disbanded under Divine Order 3:19."<br>\
  "Your assets will be reabsorbed by loyalist forces. Surviving personnel will report for reassignment, review, or \
  spiritual cleansing."<br>\
  "You were given a chance to serve the Word. You failed. The silence you leave behind will be louder than your deeds\
  \ ever were."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood under flickering lights as MekTechs disassembled targeting uplinks and tagged weapons for \
  reclamation. The banners had already been incinerated.</p>\
  <p>{9} walked beside {5}, quiet. "They didn''t even try to interrogate us."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s voice was flat. "Because our sin is complete. They don''t need answers. Just ash."</p>\
  <p>Outside, a cleansing squad escorted soldiers off the field. No accusations. Just verdicts.</p>\
  <p>{1} dropped {7} rank medallion into the fire. It was over.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.WOB=The transmission had been intercepted and destroyed \
  before it finished playing. There would be no compliance. No confession.\
  <p>{0} stood before the communications panel, manually decoupling the override link that fed into Militia \
  command.</p>\
  <p>"They call it doctrinal drift," {9} said. "As if belief were a position you could fail to hold."</p>\
  <p>"Belief isn''t the problem," {1} replied. "Obedience is."</p>\
  <p>Outside, the unit scrambled. No livery. No prayers. No rites. Just weapons. Just choice.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll send purifiers," {10} said. "They always do."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked skyward. "Then let them try to silence what they cannot control."</p>\
  <p>{18} were no longer faithful. They were free.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.WOB=The message displayed in stark monochrome. No seal. No \
  signature. Just condemnation.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Effective immediately, your unit is disbanded under Divine Order 3:19."<br>\
  "You failed to serve the Word. Your silence will be louder than your deeds ever were."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} watched the crew deck empty out. Those who could leave had. Those who stayed would not be \
  reassigned. They would be erased.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached, handing over a hardcoded manifest. "Everything we built - gone from the records."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They don''t need to kill us. They just have to remove context."</p>\
  <p>{10} dropped the unit insignia into a disposal unit. "They want silence."</p>\
  <p>"Then we''ll haunt the void they left," {1} whispered.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.WOB=The DropShip ran dark. No beacon. No registry. No \
  scripture piped through the speakers. {18} were beyond the Word now.\
  <p>{0} stared at the nav map - full of black zones, unblessed space, exile routes. Territory where the \
  Word did not reach.</p>\
  <p>"Divine Order 3:19 calls for silence," {9} said. "They''ll scour for us."</p>\
  <p>"Let them," {1} answered. "We are not their echo. We are noise."</p>\
  <p>Below, their ''Meks stood loaded and stripped. The pilots wore no robes. No glyphs. Just coolant suits and \
  purpose.</p>\
  <p>"They erased our name," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>"Then we carve a new one into the void," {1} said.</p>\
  <p>{18} jumped without sanction. Heretics in the eyes of the Word. Warriors by any other name.</p>
# Clan
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.planetside.clan=The order came in precisely, without delay or emotion.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "As of this hour, this unit is formally disbanded."<br>\
  "Your collective failure in the field, repeated insubordination, and loss of strategic assets have led to this \

  "Surviving warriors will be reassigned individually. Commanders will report for judgment."<br>\
  "The name of this force is removed from the rolls."<br>\
  "Your deeds have been weighed and found unworthy of the Remembrance."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood in the central square of the garrison, surrounded by silence. No warriors saluted. No \
  traditions were honored. Their name was already gone.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached. "Our codex records have been purged. Even the sibko tags are revoked."</p>\
  <p>"We have become stravag," {1} said quietly. "Ghosts among the living."</p>\
  <p>"Shall we submit to judgment?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned away. "Judgment is for the worthy."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.planetside.clan=The transmission announcing their dissolution had \
  been received - and ignored. Honor had been stripped, but survival remained.\
  <p>{0} stood beside a dismantled totem banner, now shattered at {7} feet.</p>\
  <p>"They will say we are dezgra," {9} said.</p>\
  <p>"Then we shall be dezgra with steel," {1} replied.</p>\
  <p>The unit moved in silence, repacking weapons, disabling signal transponders, removing every trace of the Clan \
  crest.</p>\
  <p>"Where do we go?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>"Anywhere their judgment cannot reach."</p>\
  <p>The DropShip''s engines roared. No Circle of Equals. No bidding. No trials. Only rejection - and resolve.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.inTransit.clan=The command screen glowed cold blue. The final message\
  \ blinked once and was deleted from the system automatically.\
  <blockquote><p><em>\
  "Unit disbanded."<br>\
  "Warriors reassigned."<br>\
  "Name erased."<br>\
  "Unworthy of the Remembrance."\
  </em></p></blockquote>\
  <p>{0} stood at the center of the DropShip''s observation deck. There were no unit patches left. No \
  rituals. Just stripped walls and personal effects sealed for disposal.</p>\
  <p>{9} approached. "The Remembrance will not carry our name."</p>\
  <p>{1} said nothing. {2} was watching the stars, one hand pressed to the glass.</p>\
  <p>"Do we still exist?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>"Only in memory. And memory fades."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE_DISBAND.inTransit.clan=The DropShip ran cold. No comms. No Clan markings. No \
  name.</p>\
  <p>{0} sat on the edge of the weapons platform, watching the tech crews disable biometric locks designed \
  to prevent dezgra hands from firing weapons meant for warriors.</p>\
  <p>"They cast us out," {9} said. "Not for weakness - but for failure."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They stripped our name. We will forge a new one. One they cannot erase."</p>\
  <p>The nav map was plotted manually - uncharted space. Uncontested. Untouched. A place for something new to \
  begin.</p>\
  <p>"We carry no identity," {10} muttered. "No rite. No Bloodnames."</p>\
  <p>"Then we are free of limits," {1} answered. "Not warriors by their measure. But by ours."</p>\
  <p>{18} jumped. There was no fanfare. Only a blank page - and warriors still holding pens.</p>
# SEPPUKU
## Planetside
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.0={0} kneels in the courtyard of the compound, stripped \
  of insignia, {7} uniform bare but clean. The morning air is sharp, the silence absolute. Before {5} {8, choice, \
  0#lie|1#lies} the blade - gleaming, precise, unforgiving. {2} {8, choice, 0#pick|1#picks} it up without hesitation.\
  <p>Across from {5}, {9} stands, calm, {16} eyes fixed not on {1} but on the moment itself.</p>\
  <p>{1} draws a breath, deep and final, then drives the blade into {7} abdomen, cutting across with practiced \
  resolve. Blood blooms across {7} uniform, but {3} {8, choice, 0#make|1#makes} no sound. {6} body begins to \
  tremble.</p>\
  <p>In that instant - swift as a heartbeat - {10} rises. {15} sword flashes, a blur of motion and steel. The \

  <p>{10} sheathes {16} sword, expression locked, bearing the weight of honor passed from one warrior to another.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.1={0} kneels in the center of the stone courtyard, {7} \
  gaze steady, {7} expression carved from resolve. The blade before {5} rests on a folded cloth, its edge flawless, \
  untouched by hesitation.\
  <p>Wind rustles the banners above - {7} unit''s colors. {9} stands behind {5}, silent, motionless, {16} katana \
  drawn but lowered in respect.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, grips the hilt, and slides the blade into {7} abdomen with slow, deliberate force. {6} jaw \
  tightens as {3} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} it across, blood staining the stone beneath {5}. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#does|1#do} not falter.</p>\
  <p>In that final, shuddering moment, {10} steps forward, lifts {16} blade, and strikes in a single, clean arc. \
  {1}''s body slumps forward, the head tilting but held by a narrow strip of flesh.</p>\
  <p>The silence after is complete. {10} bows once, low and deep, then turns without a word, the ritual complete and\
  \ the shame extinguished.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.2={0} kneels beneath the overcast sky, rain tapping \
  softly against {7} shoulders, staining the ceremonial cloth set before {5}. {4} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} \
  flinch.\
  <p>The courtyard is empty, save for {9}, who stands a pace behind, katana unsheathed and held in both \
  hands, blade down.</p> \
  <p>{1} lifts the short sword with reverence - {7} last act of command - and presses the tip into {7} abdomen. {2} \
  {8, choice, 0#exhale|1#exhales}, slow and steady, then {8, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} the blade across in a \
  sharp, brutal arc. {4} breath catches, but {3} {8, choice, 0#do|1#does} not cry out. {4} {8, choice, \
  0#lean|1#leans} forward, strength failing. In that instant, {10} moves. One clean motion, steel slicing air, and\
  \ {1}''s head dips forward, the body folding over itself.</p>\
  <p>The rain keeps falling. {10} lowers {16} sword, blood dripping from the edge, and bows - deep, respectful. The \
  Combine''s honor, reclaimed in silence.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.3={0} kneels in the gravel courtyard, bare hands resting\
  \ on {7} thighs, the short blade laid precisely before {5}. {6} uniform is spotless, {7} posture perfect - \
  unyielding even now.\
  <p>Across from {5}, {9} waits, katana drawn, face unreadable behind a mask of discipline.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, grips the blade, and raises it to {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} \
  hesitate. The steel sinks in with a wet sound, and {3} pulls it sideways, a grimace flickering across {7} face \
  before resolve clamps down again.</p>\
  <p>Blood flows freely. {6} breath comes shallow. As {3} {8, choice, 0#start|1#starts} to pitch forward, {10} steps\
  \ in - one clean stroke, neck to shoulder. {1}''s head rolls to the ground, and {10} stands still for a moment, rain\
  \ beginning to fall, and then bows, low and wordless. The unit''s shame dies with their commander.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.4={0} kneels in the center of the parade square, \
  shoes placed neatly behind {5}, the cold steel of the tanto resting across {7} palms. The sky is clear, the air \
  still - too calm for what''s about to happen.</p>\
  <p>{6} breathing is steady. {2} {8, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} once, then {8, choice, 0#unsheathe|1#unsheathes} the \
  blade with care, as if it still deserves respect.</p> \
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana drawn; the angle already measured in {16} mind. {1} grips the \
  blade, presses it to {7} abdomen, and drives it in. {2} {8, choice, 0#cut|1#cuts} across with grim precision, \
  teeth clenched, shoulders locked against the pain. As {7} body starts to sag, {10} moves. The katana whispers \
  through the air and finds its mark in a single, practiced strike. {1} folds forward, blood soaking into the earth\
  .</p>\
  <p>{10} holds the pose for a moment longer, then lowers the blade and bows. There are no words. The act speaks for\
  \ itself.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.5={0} kneels on the worn flagstones, back straight, eyes\
  \ forward, the tanto resting before {5} like a verdict. Behind {5}, {9} waits, katana raised, breath \
  held. The silence is total - no wind, no birds, just the slow heartbeat of tradition pressing down on both warriors\
  .</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches for the blade, lifts it, and without ceremony or pause, plunges it into {7} gut. {6} jaw clenches. \
  {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade across, slow and deliberate, pain surging through every nerve. {6} body \
  begins to falter. In that instant, {10} steps forward and strikes. The katana arcs cleanly, stopping the fall, \
  preserving the ritual.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body slumps gently, head bowed, blood darkening the stone. {10} lowers {16} sword, bows deeply, and \
  stands still - honor upheld, shame erased, nothing left but the silence.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.6={0} kneels in the courtyard, the stone beneath {5} \
  scrubbed clean for this final act. {5} uniform is immaculate, {7} posture flawless - {3} {8, choice, 0#face|1#faces} \
  death as {3} faced every order: without flinching.\
  <p>The tanto gleams in the sunlight, resting across {7} knees like a promise. Behind {5}, {9} stands \
  silent, katana drawn, arms steady.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, draws in a breath, and drives it into {7} belly. The cut is deep, decisive. Blood spills, \
  staining the cloth beneath {5}. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} cry out. {6} body trembles, begins to collapse. \
  <p>{10} moves - one fluid motion - and the katana flashes. {1}''s head lowers as the sword completes its arc.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps back, lowers {16} blade, and bows, slow and deep. The ritual is done. The Dragon watches.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.7={0} kneels in the quiet courtyard, back straight, \
  hands steady, the tanto resting across {7} lap like a final command. The banners above {5} hang limp in the still \
  air, as if the world itself is holding its breath. Behind {5}, {9} stands motionless, katana drawn, eyes\
  \ fixed on the warrior {12} once followed into the fire.</p> \
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, the metal catching the light one last time, and plunges it into {7} abdomen. The cut is \
  clean, practiced, unforgiving. Blood wells and spills. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} the blade across with grim \
  resolve, {7} body beginning to waver.</p>\
  <p>In that moment, {10} steps forward - silent, sure - and strikes. The katana sings through the air, and {1}''s \
  head falls forward. {10} lowers {16} blade and bows deeply, the weight of duty settling over {14} like ash. The \
  Dragon''s justice has been done.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.8={0} kneels on the tarmac of the compound, the scent of \
  incense curling through the still air. {6} uniform bears no rank, only the blood-red sash of final duty. The tanto \
  rests before {5}, its edge gleaming - sharp, precise, inevitable. Behind {5}, {9} stands at attention, \
  katana raised, breath measured.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade, bows {7} head once, and drives it into {7} abdomen. {6} breath hitches. The steel carves\
  \ across flesh with slow deliberation, {7} hands steady even as pain surges through {5}. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#lean|1#leans} forward, faltering.</p>\
  <p>In that instant, {10} moves. One step. One strike. The katana falls like judgment, and {1}''s body slumps. {10}\
  \ holds {16} stance, then lowers {5}self to the ground, bowing until {16} forehead nearly touches the stone. The \
  shame has ended. Only silence remains.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.planetside.9={0} kneels beneath an old cherry tree, its blossoms \
  fallen and scattered like the names of the dead. {6} boots are placed neatly behind {5}, {7} gloves folded beside \
  the tanto on the mat. {2} {8, choice, 0#close|1#closes} {7} eyes - not in fear, but in focus.\
  <p>Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana poised, the weight of the moment etched into every muscle.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, breathes in once, then drives it into {7} abdomen with unflinching force. The cut is slow, \
  deliberate, {7} face locked in stoic defiance as blood spills across the cloth.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s body begins to sag. {10} steps forward, swift and sure. The katana arcs, whispering through the air, and \
  finds its mark with surgical precision. {1}''s head lowers but does not fall. The ritual holds. {10} lowers the \
  blade and bows, the silence now sacred. The commander''s honor is restored. The Dragon need not speak.</p>
## In Transit
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.0={0} kneels on the cold steel floor of the DropShip''s \
  staging bay, the low hum of engines thrumming beneath {5} like a funeral drum. The chamber is stripped bare - no \
  banners, no insignia, just gray walls, and the sharp scent of oil and ozone.\
  <p>Before {1} lies the tanto, its blade resting on a white cloth, stark against the dull metal. Overhead, red \
  emergency lights bathe the room in a slow, pulsing glow. Behind, {9} stands motionless, katana drawn, \
  boots braced against the ship''s subtle vibrations.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, lifts the blade, and draws a breath meant to be {7} last. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#plunge|1#plunges} the steel into {7} abdomen and {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} across, {7} jaw locked against the \
  pain. Blood splatters across the deck. {2} {8, choice, 0#begin|1#begins} to falter.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps in. One strike - precise, practiced - severs the moment cleanly. {1}''s head tilts forward, body \
  folding over itself, still. The hum of the ship continues, uncaring.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} blade, bows deeply on the blood-slick deck, and says nothing. In the belly of a machine built \
  for war, a warrior''s end is honored with silence.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.1={0} kneels on the cargo deck of the DropShip, the groan\
  \ of metal echoing through the hull as the vessel idles. Overhead, fluorescent lights flicker in rhythm with the \
  ship''s systems - harsh, sterile, unflinching. The staging area has been cleared, save for a white cloth beneath the\
  \ tanto and a sealed floor drain meant for other kinds of spills.\
  <p>{1}''s uniform bears no rank. No medals. Only the crimson sash tied tightly at {7} waist. Behind {5}, Sergeant \
  {10} stands still, katana drawn, eyes locked forward, face set like stone. The air feels too dry. Too sterile.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade. No ceremony. No hesitation. {2} just {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} it into {7} gut and \
  {8, choice, 0#slice|1#slices} across, {7} breath caught in {7} throat, blood spilling onto the white cloth. The \
  deck vibrates faintly beneath {7}. {2} {8, choice, 0#waver|1#wavers}.</p>\
  <p>{10} moves in, smooth and silent. One clean strike. The katana arcs and lands true, stopping {1}''s collapse \
  with merciful finality. {6} head dips, still held by a fleshly tether. {6} body slumps.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps back. {11} {17, choice, 0#bow|1#bows} - low, exact, unwavering. Around them, the DropShip rumbles, \
  indifferent. In the eyes of the Dragon duty has been fulfilled, and disgrace laid to rest.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.2={0} kneels on the hard plating of the DropShip''s inner \
  deck, the floor vibrating softly with the pulse of fusion engines. Around {5}, the cargo bay is stripped bare - no \
  audience, no ceremony, just steel walls and silence. The overhead lights cast a harsh white glare, throwing {7} \
  shadow long across the deck.\
  <p>The tanto rests before {5} on a folded white cloth. Its blade catches the light, steady and unforgiving. Behind \
  {5}, {9} stands at attention, katana drawn, body still despite the faint shudder of the DropShip.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches for the blade, {7} breath slow and even. No words. No hesitation. {2} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} \
  the tanto into {7} abdomen, the cut deep and clean. {2} {8, choice, 0#drag|1#drags} it across with deliberate \
  force, blood spilling in rivulets across the deck. {6} arms shake. {6} balance wavers.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One motion. One cut. The katana sings through the air and ends it - precise, controlled, \
  merciful. {1}''s body folds forward, head bowed, still tethered.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} blade and bows, the gesture sharp and deep. The ship continues on, unaware. But in that stark, \
  bloodied space, honor has been answered.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.3={0} kneels on the DropShip''s maintenance deck, \
  surrounded by cold metal and the low, steady hum of life-support systems. The walls are lined with tool lockers and\
  \ bulkhead piping - no shrine, no ceremony, just function. The only thing out of place is the white cloth laid \
  neatly before {5}, and the tanto glinting under the harsh utility lights.\
  <p>{2}''{8, choice, 0#ve|1#s} stripped down - no insignia, no armor, just the crimson sash, and the weight of \
  failure. Behind {5}, {9} stands still, katana in hand, {16} expression fixed, {16} boots locked against \
  the subtle shift of the DropShip.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade, inhales once, and plunges it into {7} belly. The steel bites deep. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#pull|1#pulls} it across with firm, methodical precision, blood spilling onto the white cloth, pooling between the\
  \ seams in the deck plating. {6} breath rattles. {6} body starts to give.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward and ends it - one clean, silent stroke. The katana arcs and stops with purpose. {1} slumps, \
  head bowed, the final thread of dignity preserved.</p>\
  <p>{10} bows deeply, the red stain creeping toward {16} boots. The engines drone on. Outside, the stars don''t blink. \
  But here, in this quiet steel tomb, honor has been paid in full.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.4={0} kneels on the DropShip''s secondary hold, a space \
  meant for overflow cargo - now silent, repurposed, sacred in its own grim way. The deck is bare but for a single \
  tarp beneath {5}, a folded cloth, and the tanto resting like a final sentence. Overhead, the lights buzz faintly, \
  cold and clinical. The hum of the vessel is constant, steady, uncaring.\
  <p>{6} uniform has been stripped of rank. Only the red sash remains. Behind {5}, {9} stands ready, katana \
  drawn, feet shoulder-width apart, balance honed against the subtle sway of transit. {15} eyes don''t move from {1}''s \
  back.</p>\
  <p>{1} picks up the blade. {6} hands don''t tremble. No words are spoken - none are needed. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#thrust|1#thrusts} the tanto into {7} abdomen and draws it across, slow and resolute. Blood spills fast onto the \
  tarp, dark and steaming in the recycled air. {2} {8, choice, 0#begin|1#begins} to fall.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. {15} blade arcs in a clean, perfect motion - one stroke, no sound but steel parting air. \
  {1}''s head lowers, body folding with gravity''s pull.</p>\
  <p>{10} stands over {5} for a breath, then bows - deep, precise. The hum of the ship continues. Outside, nothing \
  changes. Inside, everything has.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.5={0} kneels in one of the DropShip''s combat bays, the \
  scent of grease and coolant still thick in the air. Overhead, hydraulic arms hang motionless, and the distant \
  clatter of tools from another deck echoes like ghosts of the living. The bay lights are dimmed by request. All \
  unnecessary systems shut down for this moment.\
  <p>Before {5} lies the tanto on a simple white cloth. No fanfare. No symbols. Just steel and silence. Behind {5}, \
  {9} stands poised, katana drawn, boots braced against the subtle vibration of the DropShip. {15} face is \
  unreadable, {16} duty absolute.</p>\
  <p>{1} takes one final breath, lifts the blade, and plunges it into {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} \
  across slowly, teeth clenched, blood running hot down {7} thighs and pooling on the deck. {2} {8, choice, \
  0#don''t|1#doesn''t} scream. {2} {8, choice, 0#don''t|1#doesn''t} falter.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One step, one swing. The katana arcs with surgical grace and lands true. {1}''s body folds, \
  head bowed, final posture intact.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers the blade, then bows, deep and long. No one claps. No one speaks. But within the sealed metal shell\
  \ of that DropShip, a commander dies with honor - and a soldier bears witness.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.6={0} kneels on the grated floor of the DropShip''s\
  \ deployment bay, surrounded by shadows cast by idle war machines. The red standby lights blink in rhythm with the \
  ship''s heartbeat, casting the scene in a muted pulse of warning and farewell. The air is dense with the scent of \
  metal, hydraulic fluid, and inevitability.\
  <p>Before {5} lies the tanto on a folded white cloth, its edge catching the red light like a quiet threat. {2} {8, \
  choice, 0#wear|1#wears} no insignia, no armor - only the crimson sash across {7} waist, tied with purpose. Behind \
  {5}, {9} stands in silence, katana drawn, body still, eyes forward.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the blade with steady hands. {2} {8, choice, 0#draw|1#draws} in a breath, sharp and final, then drives \
  the tanto into {7} abdomen. The blade carves across, slow and sure, blood spilling down {7} legs, pooling on the \
  mesh floor. The deck continues to hum beneath {5}, indifferent.</p>\
  <p>As {3} {8, choice, 0#start|1#starts} to sag forward, {10} moves. One clean motion. The katana flashes and ends it\
  \ - a precise strike, neither rushed nor delayed. {1}''s body folds, {6} head dipping forward but still held by a \
  slither of skin.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowers {16} sword, bows deeply, then remains still. Outside, stars stretch across the void. Inside, in that\
  \ steel-walled peace between wars, one warrior''s shame has been answered - and another carries it forward.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.7={0} kneels in the DropShip''s auxiliary storage bay, \
  surrounded by empty crates and bare metal walls that echo every breath like a confession. The ship rumbles softly \
  beneath {5}, engines pushing through the void, but in this moment, the world has narrowed to blood, steel, and \
  silence. A single work light casts a harsh cone over the tanto resting on a folded cloth - {7} final companion.\
  <p>{1} wears no rank, only the red sash of obligation. Behind {5}, {9} stands still as a statue, katana \
  drawn, blade angled low, waiting for the final cue.</p>\
  <p>{1} lifts the tanto. There is no tremor in {7} grip. No hesitation. {2} {8, choice, 0#plunge|1#plunges} the \
  blade into {7} abdomen and pulls across, teeth clenched, breath short. Blood flows freely, painting the cloth, \
  dripping onto the steel beneath. {6} strength ebbs. {6} body begins to tilt.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps forward. One perfect arc, honed by duty and grief, and the katana falls true. {1} slumps forward, \
  head bowed, the blade still in {7} hands. {10} lowers {16} sword and bows, slow and deep. Around {14}, the DropShip \
  hums on, unshaken. But for one warrior, the journey ends here - in silence, in steel, in honor.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.8={0} kneels on the bare plating of the DropShip''s crew \
  staging bay, stripped of insignia, {7} uniform marked only by the crimson sash tied tight around {7} waist. The hum\
  \ of the ship surrounds {5} - constant, low, and uncaring. Overhead, a single utility light casts a hard glow on \
  the tanto before {5}, its blade resting on a worn cloth stained from earlier rites.\
  <p>Behind {1}, {9} stands ready, katana in hand, posture razor-straight. The room is sealed, empty but \
  for them. No audience. No ceremony. Just obligation and duty.</p>\
  <p>{1} reaches forward, lifts the blade, and breathes in one last time. Then {3} {8, choice, 0#drive|1#drives} the \
  tanto into {7} belly and drags it across, slow, precise. {6} body seizes, blood spilling fast across the cloth, \
  down to the seams of the steel floor. {2} {8, choice, 0#lean|1#leans} forward, strength giving way.</p>\
  <p>{10} moves. One step, one arc of steel. The katana sings through the silence and ends it cleanly. {1}''s head \
  bows forward, body folding into itself.</p>\
  <p>{10} holds still for a beat, then lowers {16} sword and bows deep, {16} shadow stretching long across the deck. \
  Outside, the stars wait. Inside, the Dragon has been served.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.inTransit.9={0} kneels on the DropShip''s maintenance sub-deck, far \
  below the hum of crew chatter or the familiar clank of ''Mek servos. Down here, it''s quiet - just the drone of the \
  fusion engine and the dim flicker of emergency lights reflecting off steel walls. The floor is cold beneath {7} \
  knees. The tanto lies before {5} on a folded strip of linen, stained faintly from past use, its blade sharp enough \
  to reflect the solemnity in {7} eyes.\
  <p>{1} wears the red sash, nothing more. Behind {5}, {9} stands still, katana drawn, arms loose but \
  ready, eyes fixed on the point beyond the act. There''s no dialogue. No ritual chant. Just breath and gravity.</p>\
  <p>{1} takes the blade, grips it tight, and drives it into {7} abdomen. {2} {8, choice, 0#pull|1#pulls} across \
  with control, not haste. Blood pours out, dark and fast, spattering the deck. {2} {8, choice, 0#waver|1#wavers}.</p>\
  <p>{10} steps in. The katana flashes in the dim light - one cut, clean and final. {1} folds forward, {7} head \
  dipping low but not falling. {10} lowers the blade. {11} {17, choice, 0#bow|1#bows}, slow and deep, the silence \
  thick. Above them, the ship carries on. Below, one warrior finds peace in steel, and another carries the weight of \
  it.</p>
