FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MG=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The lights still worked. That was the insult that bit the deepest.</p>\
  <p>Overhead fluorescents buzzed to life as <b>{0}</b> crossed the threshold of the empty hangar, {7} boots \
  echoing off concrete that had once pulsed with the rhythm of purpose. Now it was cavernous silence. Mek gantries \
  stood like skeletal remains - no ''Meks, just grease stains and dangling power cables swaying in a current of air that\
  \ wasn''t there.</p>\
  <p>{2} stopped halfway to Bay Three and looked up. That was where {7} favorite used to rest. Not a pretty ''Mek, but \
  it had kept more pilots alive more times than {3} could count. Took a blast to the torso - came back swinging. Marched\
  \ through the scrum like it was born there. Gone now.</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled and tasted rust.</p>\
  <p>The fall started with the Guild.</p>\
  <p><i>Failure to uphold operational standards. Contractual disputes. Blacklisted \
  indefinitely.</i></p>\
  <p>That was the line. No arbitration. No appeal. One morning, they were certified and legit. That evening, they \
  were untouchables. A hundred contracts gone with the stroke of an official seal.</p>\
  <p>No Guild meant no support, no access to certified contracts, and no employer who valued their neck would take the \
  risk. The ones who did? Desperate. Or dishonest. Or both.</p>\
  <p>Five jobs in a row - each worse than the last. One ended in an ambush. Another, they were paid in warehouse \
  vouchers that turned out to be fake. Two more were "delayed payments" that never came. And the last? The employer \
  ghosted them the minute the job was done.</p>\
  <p>{2}''d lost four pilots. Two to enemy fire. One to debt. One to shame.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned, hands behind {7} back, scanning the dead hangar like a general inspecting the field after the \
  retreat. Not a single sound except the soft mechanical clink of {7} own steps.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> were gone.</p>\
  <p>No ceremony. No last mission. Just dispersal. Drip by drip. Techs, MekWarriors, crew - each of them with that same\
  \ look when they told {5} goodbye:\
  <p><i>It''s not your fault, {22}.</i></p>\
  <p>They meant it, but that didn''t help.</p>\
  <p>{2} sat on an empty tool crate and let the silence settle around {5} like a burial shroud. {6} hand hovered at \
  {7} jacket pocket. A flask. Still full. {2} didn''t drink it.</p>\
  <p>The Guild didn''t destroy <b>{18}</b>. It just opened the airlock and watched the pressure drop.</p>\
  <p>{1} leaned forward, elbows on knees, and muttered the only eulogy {7} unit would ever get:</p>\
  <p>"We kept the damn faith. But nobody pays for faith."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MRB=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>Two years gone, and still, {3} checked {7} messages every month. Just to see. Just in case.</p>\
  <p>This month was no different. The same flickering screen, the same login, the same silence.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat alone at the edge of a rotting landing platform. No one came here unless they were running \
  from something, or already out of places to run. The cold bit through the insulation in {7} boots, but {3} didn''t \
  move.</p>\
  <p>{2} still had the message. Not the copy ComStar sent - {3}''d wiped that months ago. This was the one {3}''d \
  transcribed by hand, line by line, like some sacred text {3} couldn''t burn.</p>\
  <p><i>Notice of Revocation: The ComStar Mercenary Review Board hereby withdraws accreditation from \
  <b>{18}</b>...</i></p>\
  <p>{2} could recite the rest from memory. {2} didn''t. {2} just folded the paper, slipped it back into the inside \
  pocket of {7} jacket, and stared out at the stars that never gave a damn.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> were gone. The DropShip had been stripped and sold. The equipment gutted for spare parts. The \
  crew scattered. Some found other units. Most didn''t.</p>\
  <p>No one sent invites. No one sent thanks.</p>\
  <p>The MRB hadn''t sent another word, either. No audit. No closure. Just that first message. Like they''d crossed a \
  line and vanished from the ledger. Bureaucratic erasure. As if <b>{18}</b> had never fought, bled, or \
  mattered.</p>\
  <p>{1} pulled the flask from {7} coat. {2} drank. Just one mouthful - enough to take the edge off the memory. Enough \
  to dull the echo of <i>"Effective immediately."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} didn''t blame ComStar anymore. They hadn''t fired the last shot. They''d just made sure no one else would hire \
  them to take another.</p>\
  <p>Far off, a cargo hauler blinked across the black sky. {2} watched it go, then leaned back against the platform''s \
  rusted railing and closed {7} eyes.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> were gone. But {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} still here. And that, somehow, was worse.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MRBC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The wind on the northern plateau was a thin, bitter thing - sharp enough to sting, but not strong enough to move \
  the past.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat on the rusted frame of a broken sensor mast, {7} coat pulled tight, collar up. Below {5}, the \
  concrete bones of an abandoned airstrip stretched toward the horizon, cracked by time and sun. <b>{18}</b> had\
  \ bivouacked here once. Just a brief refit between jobs. Before it all fell apart.</p>\
  <p>It had started with the contracts. One late payment. One botched extraction. One planetary noble who used them \
  like bait and burned the clause. Then came the citation from the MRBC - a warning at first. Then a black mark. Then \
  the kill switch.</p>\
  <p><i>Notice of Termination: The Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission hereby revokes accreditation for \
  <b>{18}</b>. Effective immediately. Further operations conducted under this banner will not be recognized or \
  protected by the MRBC.</i></p>\
  <p>That had been two years ago.</p>\
  <p>No one in the Inner Sphere touched a unit without MRBC backing unless they were desperate, criminal, or suicidal. \
  <b>{18}</b> tried to hang on. Took whatever jobs they could. Border skirmishes. Cargo escort runs with no \
  manifests. One job turned out to be a smuggling op; another didn''t pay at all.</p>\
  <p>By the end, {1} wasn''t running a company - {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} shepherding wreckage. Pilots started \
  leaving. Some without even \
  saying goodbye. Others looked {5} in the eye and apologized, like they were the ones walking away from a lost cause. \
  But none of them blamed {5}. That made it worse.</p>\
  <p>The last ''Mek they had went to a junk trader for parts. Even then, {1} had to lie about its operational status \
  just to close the deal.</p>\
  <p>{2} didn''t remember the day <b>{18}</b> ended. There was no line in the sand. No final battle. Just silence.\
  \ Missed comms. Empty bunks. A paycheck that never came and no one left to split it with.</p>\
  <p>Now it was just {5}. A commander with no command, watching frost gather on broken concrete in a forgotten corner\
  \ of the Periphery.</p>\
  <p>{2} reached into {7} coat and pulled out the old MRBC revocation notice. Printed hardcopy. Folded corners. A \
  crease down the middle where {3}''d gripped it too tightly once.</p>\
  <p>{2} read the words again. Not because {3} needed to, but because they reminded {5} that it hadn''t been a dream. \
  That <b>{18}</b> had been real. That they had mattered - if only for a while.</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at the pale horizon. Somewhere beyond it, wars still raged. MekWarriors still fought. Units rose, \
  fell, signed contracts, cashed out. The machine turned without {5} now.</p>\
  <p>"We kept the terms. We fought clean. That should''ve counted."</p>\
  <p>It didn''t. And {3} knew that. But it was all {3} had left to say.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.BARRED.MBA=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>"Scan your cargo and step aside."</p>\
  <p>{1} said it like a mantra. The words came out without thought, worn smooth by repetition. Another day, another \
  freighter pilot with a manifest half-scribbled and a chip full of Sea Fox-preferred goods.</p>\
  <p>{2} stood behind the customs station. Once, {3}''d filed mission plans in war rooms. Now {3} flagged shipments of \
  industrial lubricants and sealant.</p>\
  <p>The pilot in front of {5} - a smug Lyran brat with mirrored glasses - didn''t even look up. Just waved a form and \
  said, "Should be cleared under priority seal."</p>\
  <p>{1} scanned the form. It pinged green. Of course it did.</p>\
  <p>"You''re good," {3} said, and slid it back. The kid swaggered off without a thank-you. The kid didn''t recognize {5}.\
  \ None of them did. That was the point.</p>\
  <p>{2} watched the man disappear into the access corridor, then leaned on the counter and let the next ship''s \
  manifest roll in. A dozen crates of actuators, stamped with the Clan Sea Fox''s stylized glyph. Battle-ready \
  components, bound for a unit that probably never heard of <b>{18}</b>.</p>\
  <p>No one had. Not anymore.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t miss the fighting - not really. {2} missed the command. The discipline. The sense that you were building\
  \ something. That your work mattered. Out here, everything had the weight of vapor. DropShips in. DropShips out. \
  C-Bills changed hands. Loyalty didn''t even enter the transaction.</p>\
  <p>That''s how the Foxes won. Not with fire and steel, like the old days. They came with contracts and lines of \
  credit. Made themselves indispensable. Didn''t matter that they were invaders once. Now they were logistics \
  partners, equity stakeholders, supply chain gods. And the Inner Sphere? They bent the knee and called it progress.</p>\
  <p>{1} reached under the counter and pulled out a worn noteputer. No messages. No updates. No job offers. Just the \
  same automated ping from the MBA portal:</p>\
  <p><i>"Your unit is not recognized. MBA accreditation: revoked."</i></p>\
  <p>Two years old. {2} kept it saved. Not for hope. Just to remember who''d swung the axe.</p>\
  <p>"Next," {3} muttered. The line moved forward. {2} scanned another manifest. Another weapon shipment. Another \
  signature from a system that erased men like {5} and replaced them with logos.</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled, but only with {7} mouth.</p>\
  <p>"Enjoy your freedom," {3} thought. "Bought and paid for by Clan Sea Fox."</p>

FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.innerSphere=<h2 style="text-align:center">Three Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The coffee at the Veteran''s Club was always too weak and too hot. {23} drank it anyway.</p>\
  <p>The walls were covered in faded photos - old drop-zones, honor shots, reunion plaques that hadn''t been updated in \
  a decade. A cracked flatscreen looped recruitment ads from a war that had ended without a headline. The place \
  smelled like dust, machine oil, and institutional cologne. To {1}, it smelled like <i>home.</i></p>\
  <p>The others were already gathered when {3} arrived. Behemoth, who''d lost a leg. Ratchet, whose eyes tracked \
  everything like the enemy might still be hiding in the ceiling tiles. A few new faces rotated in now and then, but \
  the regulars never changed. They didn''t talk much about the war. They didn''t have to.</p>\
  <p>"Morning," {3} said, settling into {7} usual chair.</p>\
  <p>"You''re late," Behemoth muttered, grinning without warmth.</p>\
  <p>"Clock said 06:00."</p>\
  <p>"Club clock''s slow."</p>\
  <p>They sipped in silence. On the wall, a digital banner scrolled across the screen:</p>\
  <p><i><b>{19}</b> honors its defenders: past, present, and future.</i></p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t laugh. {2} never did. Civilians read things like that and felt good. Soldiers read them and heard a \
  door quietly lock behind them.</p>\
  <p>Three years since <b>{18}</b> were disbanded. Three years since <b>{19}</b>''s Ministry of Defense decided \
  a "consolidation of strategic resources" meant scrapping underperforming units like {7} and folding what was left \
  into border guard duties or reserve logistics. Half of {7} people vanished into training garrisons. A quarter \
  turned mercenary. The rest - those who didn''t have the right politics or the right records - just... disappeared.</p>\
  <p>{1} had gotten lucky. They gave {5} a citation, a pension, and a handshake that lasted one second too long.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} lived in a flat above a bakery where the walls were too thin and the sirens at night sounded just enough \
  like warning klaxons to keep {5} from sleeping through until dawn. {2} still woke at 06:00. Sat up. Waited for \
  reveille. Waited for orders. Instead: silence.</p>\
  <p>{2} tried to blend in. {2} really did. Bought civilian clothes. Learned how to order at caf\u00E9s. Watched \
  entertainment that didn''t end in orbital strikes or casualty reports. But {3} didn''t fit. <i>Couldn''t</i> fit. The \
  world spoke a language {3} no longer understood, and {3} didn''t have the energy to translate.</p>\
  <p>At the club, at least, {3} {8, choice, 0#wasn''t|1#weren''t} strange. Here, everyone flinched at the sound of a \
  ventilation unit kicking on.\
  \ Everyone knew why {1} always chose the chair that faced the door. No one asked stupid questions like "Have you \
  thought about moving on?"</p>\
  <p>Behemoth slid a pad across the table. A chessboard. It was {7} move. {2} stared at it for a moment, not seeing the \
  pieces. Then moved a bishop. Didn''t care where it landed.</p>\
  <p>"Still feels like I should be somewhere else," {3} said quietly. "Still feels like I''m waiting for the next \
  mission."</p>\
  <p>No one responded. They didn''t need to.</p>\
  <p>The civvie world moved on without them. But the war had planted something deep. Not a wound - wounds heal. \
  Something structural. Permanent.</p>\
  <p>The kind of thing that never leaves you. Not completely. Not even when the guns stop.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.periphery=<h2 style="text-align:center">Three Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The stipend came in on the third of every month. Minus the usual deductions: housing tax, energy ration fee, \
  former-officer adjustment. What reached {23}''s account was barely enough to cover a week''s groceries, let \
  alone {7} medical or rent.</p>\
  <p>Still, it was something. A reminder that someone, somewhere, remembered {3} had served.</p>\
  <p>The apartment was six floors up in a crumbling block that leaned slightly to the east. The lift didn''t work. \
  Pipes ticked at night. {6} neighbor ran a surgery clinic out of her living room. {1} didn''t complain. {2} was lucky \
  to have walls that kept most of the rain out.</p>\
  <p>Outside, the streets were slow to wake. A few market stalls buzzed to life. Transports hissed steam onto broken \
  pavement. Holo-ads flickered between garish sales pitches and patriotic reminders of <b>{19}</b>''s "sovereign \
  resilience."</p>\
  <p>{2} sipped instant coffee from a cracked tin mug, watching the sun rise over scaffolded rooftops. {2} could still \
  hear the rhythm of battlefield comms sometimes, buried under the city''s noise. It wasn''t nostalgia. Just echoes.</p>\
  <p>Three years since <b>{18}</b> were disbanded. <b>{19}</b>''s government had called it a "strategic \
  recalibration." The official report blamed logistics shortfalls, inconsistent deployment data, and poor morale. It \
  didn''t mention that their last three operations had been suicide missions with conflicting orders and nearly no air \
  support.</p>\
  <p><i>"<b>{0}</b> discharged with honorable citation. Lifetime stipend \
  authorized."</i></p>\
  <p>That citation bought {5} exactly one government-issued plaque and the small check that dropped into {7} account \
  each month - just long enough to keep hope on life support.</p>\
  <p>{2} had applied for teaching work. Denied. Private security. Denied. {2}''d even tried to enlist as a mechanic. \
  "Overqualified," they said. Which was another way of saying "too expensive," or "too visible." No one wanted to \
  hire a commander from a failed unit. It made them look unlucky.</p>\
  <p>So {3} rationed pills for {7} joints. Ate canned protein with stale bread. Played cards alone in the evenings, \
  mostly to keep {7} hands from shaking. Sometimes {3} skipped a meal to afford a bottle. Sometimes the bottle skipped\
  \ {5} straight to morning.</p>\
  <p>It wasn''t hell. Just slow erosion. Like metal rusting under constant drizzle. Quiet, undramatic decay.</p>\
  <p>Down in the alley, kids played with a ball. {2} watched them for a while. Smiled without meaning to.</p>\
  <p>Then the alarm on {7} wrist chimed - reminder to check the power usage, maybe shave a little off the next bill. {2} \
  sighed. Finished the coffee. Stood.</p>\
  <p>{2} still stood like a soldier, out of habit. But no one saluted back.</p>\
  <p>"Just gotta get through the month."</p>\
  <p>{2} said it every morning. Some days, {3} even believed it.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.clan=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The forge bay stank of hot metal and old sweat. Steam hissed from coolant lines as another casting came off the \
  line - unpainted body armor for a kit no laborer would ever wear. {23} locked the cooling brackets in place, \
  sparks bouncing off {7} gloves.</p>\
  <p>"Nice weld, <i>{22}</i>," someone muttered behind {5}. Not respect. Not even sarcasm. Just routine mockery. \
  Like a ritual.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t turn around. {2} didn''t flinch. Just moved to the next bench. That was the rule down here - keep moving.\
  \ Keep quiet. Keep your head down unless you were looking for a fight that no one would ever bother to stop.</p>\
  <p>It had been three years since <b>{18}</b> were disbanded. <b>{19}</b> gave them a full trial: analysis, \
  deliberation, ritual critique. Words like "dishonor," "inefficiency," "unworthy" were used like scalpels. Not cruel. \
  Precise.</p>\
  <p><i>"Failure has consequence," the Loremaster had said. "You will serve where you are \
  suited."</i></p>\
  <p>{1}''s bloodright as a warrior hadn''t saved {5}. Now {3} served in the laborer caste. Same oxygen, different \
  purpose.</p>\
  <p>{2} wiped {7} hands on a rag and checked the pressure gauges. {6} back ached. {6} left shoulder still popped from\
  \ a wound {3} couldn''t remember receiving. No one offered {5} meds. Pain was part of the penance.</p>\
  <p>Some of the other laborers eyed {5} from across the bay. A few smirked. Most didn''t care. They had their own \
  ghosts. Their own faded dreams of command, of victory, of glory stripped away. There were always failed warriors in\
  \ the labor pits. You could spot them by the way they stood too tall at first. Then slowly began to shrink.</p>\
  <p>Not all mocked {5}. A few nodded in passing. That half-second flicker of eye contact - the quiet acknowledgment of\
  \ shared humiliation. Their war wasn''t over. It had just turned inward.</p>\
  <p>One of the tech overseers barked orders across the floor. {1} obeyed without question. Efficiency metrics were \
  monitored. Deviations logged. You couldn''t fall farther than labor caste - but you could still be made an example.</p>\
  <p>{2} caught {7} reflection in a panel of polished alloy - gray jumpsuit, shaved head, expression like stone. No rank. \
  No insignia. Just someone going through the motions so {3} wouldn''t fall apart.</p>\
  <p>{2} didn''t feel sorry for {5}{8, choice, 0#self|1#selves}. Not really. {2} knew {3}''d failed. Knew exactly which moment had shattered the \
  path {3}''d been born into. But knowing didn''t make the war inside stop. It just made it quieter. Meaner.</p>\
  <p>{2} returned to the bench. Picked up the next piece. Another weld. Another hour. Another day survived.</p>\
  <p>Behind {5}, someone said nothing at all - and {3} understood that, too.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.CC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The dormitory was quiet after lights-out. No alarms. No footsteps. Just the low hum of the ventilation grid and \
  the distant echo of someone coughing three rooms down.</p>\
  <p>{23} lay on {7} back, staring at the ceiling. White. Seamless. Featureless, except for the blinking \
  node light that confirmed {3} hadn''t left {7} bunk since final check-in. If {3} moved, it would log it. If {3} didn''t,\
  \ it would log that too. Monitoring was constant. It had become background noise. Like breathing.</p>\
  <p>{2} wasn''t in the education camp anymore. {2} knew that. It had been two years since {7} final review. But some \
  rooms followed you. Some ceilings never stopped looking down.</p>\
  <p>{2} still remembered the day <b>{18}</b> were shut down. No warning. Just a crisp directive from Strategic \
  Operations Command. The wording was precise:</p>\
  <p><i>"<b>{18}</b> battalion disbanded. Command structure dissolved. Personnel subject to reassignment\
  \ pending reevaluation."</i></p>\
  <p>"Pending reevaluation." That had been the real message. {1}''s had come three weeks later, delivered by a Liaison\
  \ Officer flanked by Political Intelligence Bureau staff.</p>\
  <p><i>"<b>{0}</b>, your record indicates patterns of doctrinal drift and operational insubordination\
  \ inconsistent with the ideological standards of the Capellan military. You will report to Collective \
  Rehabilitation Facility Eight-Seven."</i></p>\
  <p>Facility Eight-Seven wasn''t where they sent traitors. It was where they sent failures - those who didn''t betray \
  the Confederation, but also didn''t serve it well enough. A subtler form of exile.</p>\
  <p>There were classes. Modules. Review sessions. Confessionals. Some of the questions didn''t have right answers, \
  just gradients of obedience. By the third month, {1} stopped trying to pass. {2} just answered in whatever tone they\
  \ wanted that day. That was the trick. Not belief - compliance.</p>\
  <p>When {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} finally released, they didn''t send {5} back to command. No assignment. No \
  clearance. Not even a \
  debrief. They just issued {5} a civilian ID and told {5} to make {5}{8, choice, 0#self|1#selves} useful.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} ran supply inventory at a state-controlled hydroponics plant. {2} hadn''t touched a ''Mek in 730 days.</p>\
  <p>{2} still remembered the names of every pilot under {7} command. {2} didn''t say them out loud anymore. That was \
  one of the lessons from Eight-Seven - what isn''t spoken can''t be used against you.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes, in the mirror, {3} still caught glimpses of the officer who gave orders, who negotiated a ceasefire \
  with {7} pistol half-drawn, who signed field reports with pride. That officer had been useful. That officer had worn \
  the emblem of House Liao with conviction.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} wore state coveralls and answered to an efficiency monitor.</p>\
  <p>{2} blinked slowly, ceiling still staring back. The node light blinked once, then again. Logged and compliant. {2}\
  \ was always compliant now.</p>\
  <p>{2} rolled over and closed {7} eyes. The ceiling didn''t follow. But the silence did.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.DC=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The shrine room was empty, as it always was when {3} arrived. Third hour of the night. No incense. No prayers. \
  Just dust clinging to corners and the silence of a family that had stopped speaking {7} name aloud.</p>\
  <p>{23} knelt anyway. Formal posture. Hands on thighs. Eyes forward. {2} didn''t pray. That would have been \
  presumptuous. The ancestors didn''t listen to the disgraced. They endured them.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had been given more chances than they deserved. That''s what they''d told {5}. First in whispers.\
  \ Then in formal reprimands. Then in the final directive, delivered by a junior officer who wouldn''t meet {7} \
  eyes:</p>\
  <p><i>"<b>{18}</b> command disbanded. Unit record archived under failures of doctrinal execution. \
  Command responsibility lies with <b>{0}</b>."</i></p>\
  <p>No trial. No exile. Just formal dishonor. The kind that follows like smoke clinging to your clothes. People \
  recognized {5} in the street - civilian dress, no rank insignia - but they still turned slightly as {3} passed. Not out \
  of fear. Out of <i>politeness</i>. A ritualized distance. The living embodiment of failure walking past them.</p>\
  <p>{2}''d gone to {7} uncle''s home once. Not long after. Stood outside for twenty-three minutes before the door \
  opened. A child peeked out, eyes wide. Then the door closed again. No words. Just the sound of the latch clicking \
  shut.</p>\
  <p>The next day, {7} family removed {5} from the dinner registry. No confrontation. No letter. Just a blank space \
  where {7} name used to be. That was enough.</p>\
  <p>{2} stayed away now. Lived in a quiet sector near the outer residential districts. Taught historical tactics at a\
  \ community academy where no one addressed {5} by rank. {6} students knew, of course. Everyone did. But they were \
  too polite to mention it. That was the way of the Combine.</p>\
  <p>At night, {3} came here. The family shrine. The one place that still had {7} code in the doorlock, even if no one\
  \ had told {5} {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} unwelcome. They didn''t need to.</p>\
  <p>{2} looked up at the wall of ancestral tablets. {6} father''s name was there. {6} grandfather''s. Generations of \
  warriors, bureaucrats, and loyal citizens of the Dragon.</p>\
  <p>{6} tablet would not be added.</p>\
  <p>{2} rose with care, bowed to the ancestors - deep and wordless - and left without sound.</p>\
  <p>The shrine door locked behind {5}.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.LA=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The room smelled like chilled wine and self-congratulation.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> - though no one called {5} that anymore - stood near the edge of the ballroom, one hand resting on a \
  crystal tumbler, the other in {7} jacket pocket, thumb brushing the frayed edge of {7} cuff. {2} hadn''t noticed it \
  until ten minutes ago. Now {3} couldn''t stop noticing.</p>\
  <p>The gala was a Lyran affair in the worst way. Gold accents. Four orchestras. Holographic banners projected along\
  \ the ceiling, rotating through highlights of the Duke''s new economic initiative. And soldiers - of a sort - everywhere. \
  Dress uniforms with zero wear. Medals that gleamed like they''d never seen combat. A full platoon of officers who''d \
  never given a field order in their lives.</p>\
  <p>They called it the "Security Sector Stabilization Gala." What it really was? A party for people who''d never \
  bled, thrown by people who''d never led.</p>\
  <p>{1} tried not to wince as a laughter burst from the circle nearby. {2} didn''t need to hear it. {2} already knew \
  the story they were telling. The punchline had been circulating for two years:</p>\
  <p><i>"<b>{18}</b>. Oh, you mean the unit that lost three ''Meks in a training exercise and blamed \
  the terrain? Wasn''t their CO some spoiled academy dropout?"</i></p>\
  <p>They rarely said {7} name directly. That would imply {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} present. That {3} mattered.</p>\
  <p>It hadn''t mattered that {3}''d come up fighting. That {3}''d taken command because no one else would. That {3}''d kept \
  that damn unit together through meat grinders, each worse than the last. None of it mattered. <b>{18}</b> had \
  failed. Publicly. Loudly. And Lyrans loved a story they could laugh at with one hand on a champagne flute.</p>\
  <p>"<b>{0}</b>?"</p>\
  <p>{2} turned. A familiar face - Colonel Einhart. Retired. Comfortable. Someone who''d served long enough to know \
  better, but smiled like a man fully at peace with the lie.</p>\
  <p>"Didn''t expect to see you here. How''s... post-service life treating you?"</p>\
  <p>The pause before <i>post-service</i> was surgical. Long enough to remind {1} this wasn''t retirement. It was \
  disqualification.</p>\
  <p>"It''s quiet," {1} said. "No one asks me for anything anymore."</p>\
  <p>Einhart chuckled, a polite sound. "Must be a change of pace. You always struck me as more of a... systems guy. \
  Administrative command, wasn''t it?"</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled. "Yes. I administrated a lot of funerals."</p>\
  <p>There was a beat of silence. Then another chuckle. Awkward. Muted.</p>\
  <p>{1} finished {7} drink, nodded, and walked away before the conversation could pivot to finance portfolios or \
  shipping subsidies. {2} passed another group - young officers-in-training, one wearing a unit patch on his dress \
  jacket.</p>\
  <p>"Hey," one of them whispered, mock-serious. "Think I can get court-martialed just for proximity?"</p>\
  <p>Laughter. {1} didn''t stop walking.</p>\
  <p>{2} found the exit without looking for it. Fresh air hit {5} like clarity. No ceremony. No judgment. Just sky. \
  For a moment, that was enough.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.FS=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The Sun and Sword still flew over the compound gates, crisp in the wind, proud as ever. {1} didn''t look at it \
  anymore. Not out of disrespect - just exhaustion. You could only salute a flag so many times before it stopped seeing \
  you.</p>\
  <p>{2} stood alone at the edge of the veterans'' courtyard, a small, immaculately kept garden tucked inside a larger \
  government complex. Birds chirped. The fountain trickled. It all looked... noble. Clean. Like the Federation {3} used \
  to believe in.</p>\
  <p>"<b>{0}</b>."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned slowly. It was Captain Heller again - bright-eyed, clean-cut, the kind of woman who''d never tasted \
  failure, but studied it in reports.</p>\
  <p>"Just {1}," {3} said.</p>\
  <p>Heller smiled like it was a kindness. "Of course. I just wanted to say - the review panel looked over your debrief\
  \ again. Your command decisions? They showed conviction. You did what you could under impossible circumstances."</p>\
  <p>{1} said nothing. {2} kept {7} face neutral. The way {3} had when generals stopped speaking in strategy and \
  started speaking in slogans.</p>\
  <p>"The Federated Suns doesn''t forget its own," Heller added, placing a respectful hand on {1}''s shoulder. "You \
  served. That still matters."</p>\
  <p>She walked off after that. Always short, always dignified. Like a funeral speech in uniform.</p>\
  <p>{1} sat on a bench beneath a tall holly tree. {2} rubbed at the calluses on {7} hands - faded now, softening. You \
  don''t keep calluses when you don''t wear a neurohelmet anymore.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had been loyal. Not elite. Not flashy. But they''d tried. They''d held the line until the \
  artillery fell. They''d bled. And when they broke, High Command had used the gentlest language imaginable:</p>\
  <p><i>"Disbanded with honors. Command concluded. Personnel offered reassignment or \
  release."</i></p>\
  <p>{1} hadn''t been reassigned. {2} hadn''t been court-martialed, either. {2}''d been... thanked. Given benefits. \
  Commended. Shelved. They called it mercy. It felt like exile.</p>\
  <p>{2} was still addressed as "{22}" by the admin clerks. Still invited to public remembrance ceremonies. Still \
  handed VIP passes to bases {3} no longer had clearance to enter.</p>\
  <p>The Sun forgave {5}. Everyone had.</p>\
  <p>That was what made it unbearable.</p>\
  <p>{2} looked up at the banner one last time. It waved clean in the breeze, unmarred by politics, undimmed by war. \
  {2} didn''t hate it. {2} just didn''t belong to it anymore.</p>\
  <p>The fountain trickled. Somewhere nearby, another speech had begun.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.FWL=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The terminal at the end of the station concourse flickered with another headline. Parliament in session. A \
  motion passed. A scandal buried. The Minister of Defense smiled with the smugness of someone who''d never stepped \
  inside a cockpit.</p>\
  <p>{23} sipped lukewarm coffee and watched the newsfeed roll on. Same suits. Same families. Same circular \
  backslaps wrapped in legislative jargon. The League in motion.</p>\
  <p>Behind {5}, people bustled - dock workers, junior officers, interstellar logistics staff all trying to get \
  somewhere slightly more important than where they currently stood. No one looked twice at {5}. The uniform was long\
  \ gone. So was the rank. Just someone on another bench with a duffel bag full of nothing.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had lasted how many years? It depended on where you started counting, and it didn''t matter. Not \
  in the Free Worlds League. Not when a commander catches the wrong kind of attention in a post-action report - \
  criticized logistics allocations, or suggested maybe corporate defense priorities shouldn''t supersede rontline \
  readiness. Not when some mid-tier parliamentarian could twist that into an insult on the floor and ride the outrage\
  \ into a committee seat.</p>\
  <p><i>"Failure to maintain operational cohesion. <b>{18}</b> disbanded by executive directive under \
  Article 4.7 of the Defense Compliance Act."</i></p>\
  <p>No hearing. No inquiry. No rebuttal. Just ink on paper, and a press release so neutral it could have been \
  written by an accountant.</p>\
  <p>{2}''d asked for an audience, once. Just once. They said {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} welcome to file a formal statement. They even \
  offered a public relations consultant to "shape the narrative." {2} declined.</p>\
  <p>The narrative was already shaped. {2} was the commander who lost control. The commander whose failures - real or \
  manufactured - were more useful than {7} successes. A story that made someone look strong in the Chamber of Deputies.\
  \ That''s all that mattered.</p>\
  <p>{2}''d stopped trying to remember the politician''s name. It wasn''t worth the space in {7} head.</p>\
  <p>{1} finished the coffee. It tasted like burnt plastic. Somewhere overhead, a DropShip thundered into orbit. Not \
  one {3}''d ever ride again.</p>\
  <p>{2} stood up, slung the duffel over {7} shoulder, and walked toward the loading platform. {2} didn''t have a \
  destination. Just a pass, a name no one recognized anymore, and the memory of a unit that used to mean something.</p>\
  <p>The League would forget <b>{18}</b>. That was the point.</p>\
  <p>{1} wouldn''t.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.TH=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The air smelled like nothing. Filtered, recirculated, scrubbed of imperfections. Even in the public zones, you \
  couldn''t smell soil, or sweat, or war. Just climate control and polite silence.</p>\
  <p>{23} walked through one of the surface cities - District 38, Precinct Core - and felt less real with every \
  step. The buildings were white-tiled and seamless, glass-fronted and ringed with surveillance nodes. The people \
  were orderly. Everyone wore the same soft-gray civilian coats issued by the Civil Harmony Directorate.</p>\
  <p>No rank. No patches. No identity.</p>\
  <p>{2} blended in, and that was the point. {2} wasn''t supposed to exist.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had been erased two years ago. Not in disgrace. Not with fury. With indifference. Their \
  failures had bruised Terra''s image abroad - made the Hegemony look weak during a trade summit, exposed some \
  diplomatic backdoor during an op gone sideways in the Terran Corridor.</p>\
  <p><i>"Operational unit dissolved by strategic discretion. Commander reassigned to civic integration \
  protocol. Status: neutralized."</i></p>\
  <p>That was the official language. "Neutralized." Not dead. Not imprisoned. Just... removed from circulation.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} walked the perfectly maintained plazas and security-zoned markets like a ghost with a heartbeat. A \
  failure in a system that didn''t tolerate the concept of failure. Not openly.</p>\
  <p>{2} passed a school with children in immaculate uniforms reciting loyalty mantras. Passed a security post where a\
  \ Peacekeeper leaned casually against the wall, one hand near {7} badge, the other tapping a noteputer.</p>\
  <p>No one saluted {5}. No one acknowledged {5}. {6} face had been flagged in the system - not as a threat, but as a \
  redacted former asset. "Observe. Do not engage."</p>\
  <p>Even the people who knew what <b>{18}</b> were wouldn''t talk to {5}. Not directly. Maybe a look. A nod. But\
  \ never a word. That would invite scrutiny. Questions. No one wanted that.</p>\
  <p>{2} stopped in front of a reflectionless window - one of the district''s "social observatories," where citizens \
  could record grievances, suggestions, or personal growth logs. {2} didn''t go inside. {2} just stared at {7} \
  reflection in the black glass.</p>\
  <p>It stared back. No insignia. No uniform. Just someone with too much posture for civilian life and eyes that \
  didn''t forget what they''d seen.</p>\
  <p>"Terra first," {3} whispered. "And the rest of us buried beneath it."</p>\
  <p>Someone walked by, glanced at {5}, then quickly looked away.</p>\
  <p>{1} stepped back onto the sidewalk and kept moving. Slow. Directionless. Careful not to stand out. The Hegemony \
  didn''t make martyrs out of men like {5}. It made them invisible.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.ROS=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>They called it the Garden District. Wide walkways, clean stone paths, bursts of red and green flora engineered \
  to bloom year-round. Solar lamps glowed gently even after dusk, casting everything in a soft, curated light.</p>\
  <p>{23} walked the same route every evening. Past the mural of the Unity Council. Past the monument to \
  civilian logistics volunteers. Past the brass plaque etched with {7} name - fourth row, left side, beneath "Honored \
  Military Contributors."</p>\
  <p>{2} never stopped at the plaque.</p>\
  <p>"Good evening, {22}."</p>\
  <p>A voice from the side - smiling woman, gray-haired, wearing a community services sash. {2} nodded. No title \
  correction. No scowl. Just a nod. That was easier than explaining {3} didn''t feel like a {22} anymore.</p>\
  <p>"Thank you for your service," she added, gentle and sincere.</p>\
  <p>That part always landed like a blade. {2} didn''t flinch, but {7} jaw tightened, just slightly.</p>\
  <p>The Republic was good at honoring its veterans. Especially those who served during the rough years. \
  <b>{18}</b> had operated when remnants of warlords and House loyalists tested the borders, raided outposts, \
  sabotaged transports. {6} unit had responded. Secured routes. Protected civilians. Made tough calls. And failed.</p>\
  <p><i>"Following operational review and citizen oversight committee recommendation, <b>{18}</b> is\
  \ hereby decommissioned. <b>{0}</b> is released from active command with full Republic rights and veteran \
  status."</i></p>\
  <p>That was the ruling. Neutral. Painless. A promise that all things - success and failure alike - could be folded into\
  \ the greater civic narrative of unity.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} got smiles. Stipends. Free clinic access. The occasional request to speak at community forums about \
  "serving in times of uncertainty." {2} always declined.</p>\
  <p>The truth was, {3} {8, choice, 0#wasn''t|1#weren''t} proud of what {3}''d done. {2} wasn''t proud of how it \
  ended. {6} people died under {7} \
  watch - some in battle, some by slow attrition, some quietly after the unit folded. The chaos hadn''t been defeated. \
  Just... absorbed. Repackaged. Brushed aside.</p>\
  <p>{1} passed a young couple with a stroller. The man nodded respectfully. The woman smiled warmly.</p>\
  <p>"That''s {1}," she whispered to the child. "{2} helped protect us."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t break stride. {2} didn''t deserve their gratitude. But the Republic had made {7} service part of its \
  identity. {2} wasn''t human anymore - {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} a myth with a face.</p>\
  <p>{2} reached the bench at the far end of the garden, sat down, and looked out over the canal. The water glowed \
  faintly with reflected light from the glass towers above. It was beautiful. It was peaceful. It was everything they \
  said they fought for.</p>\
  <p>And it felt like a lie {3} {8, choice, 0#wasn''t|1#weren''t} allowed to challenge.</p>\
  <p>Another passerby gave {5} a nod and a salute.</p>\
  <p>{1} smiled. Because that was what was expected. And because anything else would be seen as disrespectful to the \
  dream {3}''d helped build.</p>\
  <p>{2} hated that most of all.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.SL=<h2 style="text-align:center">Two Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The rain hadn''t stopped in three days.</p>\
  <p>{23} didn''t mind. The alley behind the regional Ministry of Unity building had a drainage slope and \
  just enough overhang to keep the worst of it off {5}. {2} sat with {7} back against the concrete, legs pulled in, \
  coat wrapped around a bottle that still had half its contents. {2} was saving that for later. Or not. Time didn''t \
  mean much anymore.</p>\
  <p>Somewhere overhead, a Lewis Skimmer Bus whispered past - probably packed with League administrators commuting \
  between ministries, talking about transparency, cohesion, galactic renewal. None of them would see {5}. They never \
  looked down.</p>\
  <p>There was a time they saluted. A time {3} wore the crest of the Star League Defense Force on {7} uniform and \
  believed the rhetoric about order, progress, and peace. That time was gone.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had served faithfully. Held the line. Guarded League worlds. Cleared insurgents. Until they \
  failed. Not catastrophically. Just... consistently. Miscommunications. Thin logistics. A shuttle downed with \
  civilian cargo onboard. The kind of failures no one wanted to talk about, but everyone wanted someone to blame.</p>\
  <p><i>"Command review complete. Unit performance determined to be below acceptable thresholds. \
  <b>{18}</b> deactivated by Bureau Directive 429-B. <b>{0}</b>: decommissioned with administrative \
  citation."</i></p>\
  <p>It had come folded in silver-and-white Star League parchment, wrapped in patriotic language, stamped with four \
  overlapping department seals. No appeal. No explanation. Just a notice of service termination and a thank-you \
  note.</p>\
  <p>They''d buried the unit in a cloud of respectful vagueness. "Reform efforts." "Streamlined readiness." "Personnel\
  \ reassigned."</p>\
  <p>Except {5}.</p>\
  <p>No reassignment. No support. Just silence. A quiet memo to let the stain fade on its own.</p>\
  <p>{2} took a pull from the bottle. The burn helped. It quieted the faces - those who''d followed {5}, bled for {5}, \
  trusted {5}. The ones who hadn''t gotten out. The ones the League never mentioned in its polished speeches.</p>\
  <p>Sometimes a junior officer or civil peaceworker would recognize {5} - try to offer help. "Veteran outreach." \
  "Rehousing options." "You served the League, sir."</p>\
  <p>{2} ignored them. Every time.</p>\
  <p>Help meant paperwork. Interviews. Reflection. It meant letting the League smooth {5} over and use {7} face in \
  some renewal campaign about supporting the troops. {2}''d be a lesson, a profile, a success story. {2}''d rather rot \
  here in the rain than let them wrap {7} failure in a flag again.</p>\
  <p>A child passed once, pulling at her mother''s sleeve. "Mommy, {3} {8, choice, 0#has|1#have} medals."</p>\
  <p>The woman hurried her along. She didn''t look back.</p>\
  <p>{2} drank again.</p>\
  <p>The bus passed overhead again, silent and bright, disappearing into the clouds. {1} closed {7} eyes. {2} didn''t \
  want to be saved. {2} just wanted to be forgotten right.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.FC=<h2 style="text-align:center">3070, Three Years After the War...</h2>\
  <p>The ruins of the old transit relay station were still half-standing, even three years after the shelling. Grass \
  pushed up through shattered ferrocrete. Power cables twisted like vines around the broken superstructure. The sun \
  hung low and red, catching on the rusted girders like it was bleeding light.</p>\
  <p>{23} sat on a broken column, jacket pulled tight, watching the wind shift dust across the bones of the \
  Commonwealth.</p>\
  <p>It was 3070. The war was over. But nothing felt finished.</p>\
  <p>The Federated Commonwealth had split like glass under pressure. Steiner and Davion - dreamed into unity by nobles \
  and idealists - had torn each other apart. Brother against sister. Province against province. Dozens of units lost in\
  \ internal purges, political betrayals, or worst of all: friendly fire passed off as "accidental engagements."</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had survived longer than most. Long enough to fail where it counted.</p>\
  <p>One campaign too slow. One outpost left undefended. One retreat that left a flank exposed. The kind of things no\
  \ one noticed in peacetime - but in civil war, they became reasons why empires cracked in half.</p>\
  <p><i>"Following strategic evaluation, <b>{18}</b> command is to be dissolved. Unit performance \
  deemed nonviable for continued service under restructured military priorities."</i></p>\
  <p>Officially, they hadn''t been blamed for anything. Just another quiet casualty of reorganization. But {1} knew \
  better.</p>\
  <p>{2} ran the numbers every night. The timetable. The comms logs. The reinforcement routes. {2}''d missed something. \
  Or misjudged. Or just hadn''t had the spine to push back when it counted.</p>\
  <p>If they had held the line better. If they''d reinforced the Sixth Lyran Guards. If {3} had overridden command \
  hesitation and sent <b>{18}</b> forward instead of waiting for support that never came...</p>\
  <p>Maybe the dominoes wouldn''t have fallen. Maybe the fracture wouldn''t have spread. Maybe they could have kept the\
  \ dream alive a little longer.</p>\
  <p>{2} looked at {7} hands. Scarred. Still strong. But empty. {2} hadn''t worn gloves since the unit was disbanded. \
  Didn''t seem right without the neurohelmet to follow.</p>\
  <p>A child''s voice called out in the distance - playing in the ruins with others, laughing like the war had never \
  touched them. That was the promise, wasn''t it? That they''d suffer so the next generation wouldn''t have to. Except \
  the children didn''t live in the Commonwealth. They lived in the mess left behind.</p>\
  <p>{2} picked up a chunk of broken armor plating from the dirt. Faded blue paint. Commonwealth colors. The kind that\
  \ used to mean something.</p>\
  <p>"If we''d fought harder... Maybe the dream didn''t have to die."</p>\
  <p>{1} set the metal down gently, like an offering. The wind caught the dust again. The sound of boots in gravel. \
  But no one was coming. Just echoes.</p>\
  <p>{2} stayed a little longer. Then stood. One more look at what they lost. And what {3}''d failed to protect.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.RWR=<h2 style="text-align:center">Six Months Later...</h2>\
  <p>The station smelled like burnt oil and sweat. The kind of place where deals happened in alleyways and loyalty \
  came in three-month installments. {1} kept {7} head down as {3} stepped into the alley behind the courier office, a \
  packet of forged residency credentials tucked under one arm.</p>\
  <p>Six months. That''s how long it had taken for the silence to get loud enough to kill {5}.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> hadn''t even gotten a headline. Just a memo from Central Authority: disbanded for "failure to \

  Not until {1} started asking questions. Not until {3} tried to collect backpay. Not until {3} started writing letters\
  \ no one wanted traced.</p>\
  <p>The air in the alley was dead still. No wind. Just the buzz of a half-broken neon sign above a closed sex shop.</p>\
  <p>{2} moved fast. One hand on the credentials, the other checking the mag of the sidearm {3} {8, choice, \

  <p>{2} turned.</p>\
  <p>The first round hit {5} in the chest. Center mass. {2} stumbled backward, slammed into the wall. Didn''t drop. \

  into the dark.</p>\
  <p>The second round took {5} in the gut. The third, behind the jaw. Lights out.</p>\
  <p>The figure stepped out of shadow. Slick coat, matte visor, gloves that didn''t leave prints. No words. No rush. \
  Just confirmation.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b>''s body slumped into a pile of spilled trash. One final breath wheezed out. Then nothing.</p>\

  complaint.</p>\
  <p>{2} didn''t name them. That felt unnecessary. They weren''t comrades. Just creatures. They ate, they wandered, they\
  \ slept. {2} found that admirable.</p>\
  <p>The homestead sat thirty kilometers west of anything with a comm tower. Just scrubland, rock, and weather. The \
  kind of place no one looked for unless they were lost, or determined. {2} used to get visitors. Once every few \
  months, someone would find their way up the trail - former soldiers from <b>{18}</b>, mostly. They came with \
  questions. Or apologies. Or worse: hope.</p>\
  <p>{2} turned them away. Every time.</p>\
  <p>Now no one came. That was fine.</p>\
  <p>It had been three years since <b>{18}</b> were disbanded. Three years since the final report came down from\
  \ the Concordat Defense Ministry. It had been short, almost polite:</p>\
  <p><i>"House unit ''<b>{18}</b>'' terminated due to sustained underperformance and failure to meet \
  campaign objectives. Personnel dismissed or reassigned. <b>{0}</b>: released from duty without \
  citation."</i></p>\
  <p>No citation. No commendation either. Just gone. Like the war they''d lost had never needed them in the first \
  place.</p>\
  <p>{2} didn''t miss it. Not really. The orders. The politics. The way every battle felt like a negotiation wrapped in\
  \ blood and pressure. {2}''d done {7} job until {3} couldn''t anymore, and when the system had no more use for {5}, it \
  had released {5} into silence.</p>\
  <p>{2}''d taken it.</p>\
  <p>The sheep rustled around {7} boots. One nudged {7} leg, impatient. {1} dumped the feed without looking and \
  turned back toward the house. It was a simple place - two rooms, a stove, water tanks rigged into the roof gutters. \
  {2} didn''t need much. Just space. And time.</p>\
  <p>Inside, the only relic from {7} old life was a faded patch from {7} uniform - sealed in glass, turned face-down on\
  \ a shelf {3} no longer dusted. {2} hadn''t touched it in over a year.</p>\
  <p>{2} poured coffee, sat by the window, and listened to the wind move across the fields. No radio. No computer. Just \
  the low bleating of sheep and the rattle of a screen door that never quite latched right.</p>\
  <p>Out here, {3} didn''t have to be anything. Not a {22}. Not a disgrace. Not someone with a story.</p>\

  <p>The dancer''s skin shimmered under the ultraviolet wash - soft caramel laced with synthetic white dapples. Her \

  <p>She was a gazelle. Or rather, she''d been made to look like one - surgically and chemically sculpted to match a \

  <p>"You want the room?" she asked, tail curling behind her. "I can be... more if you want."</p>\
  <p>"No," {3} said, voice hoarse. "Just sit there. Don''t talk. Don''t move. Just don''t be..." {2} trailed off.</p>\
  <p>She paused, then obeyed. Her ears folded slightly, defaulting to a passive state. Obedience was coded into her \
  contract. She didn''t ask who she wasn''t meant to be. She was smart enough to know when not to talk.</p>\
  <p>{1} lit a stim-stick. Didn''t smoke it. Just watched the ember burn down like a fuse. Around {5}, the club \
  pulsed - synth-beats and laughter, scent and color. Nothing real. Nothing old.</p>\
  <p>That was how {3} survived: by making sure nothing ever looked like the life {3} used to have.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> were dust. Buried under bungled operations and political failures no one remembered. But {3} \
  remembered. And so long as {3} did, {3}''d keep running. One fix at a time. One modification at a time. One beautiful \
  lie after another. In the Magistracy, lying was made easy.</p>\
  <p>"Everything new," {3} muttered. "Everything except me."</p>\
  <p>The drink kicked in hard. {6} heartbeat slowed. The lights blurred. {2} leaned back, one hand resting on the \
  dancer''s artificial thigh, the other gripping the edge of the table like it might anchor {5} to something real.</p>\
  <p>It wouldn''t.</p>

  <p>The classroom smelled faintly of turpentine and dry paper. The walls were off-white, streaked with charcoal \
  fingerprints and the occasional pastel smudge. Sunlight poured through tall windows, catching in the dust that \
  always seemed to hang, no matter how often the floors were swept.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> - no one called {5} that anymore - stood at the front of the room, holding a sketch of a reclining \
  figure.</p>\
  <p>"See the tension in the lines here?" {3} said, pointing with a graphite stick. "The artist doesn''t need to show \
  muscle strain directly. It''s in the weight of the posture. The implied motion."</p>\
  <p>A few students nodded, mostly silent. One scribbled notes. Another stared out the window. It was fine. This \
  wasn''t a military lecture. No one here would die if they weren''t paying attention.</p>\
  <p>The bell rang, soft and late. {1} stepped aside, nodding them out. "Same time next week. Bring your preliminary \
  sketches."</p>\
  <p>They filed out without urgency. Some waved. A couple gave half-smiles - the quiet kind of respect students give to\
  \ someone they know won''t push too hard. {2} was older than most of the staff. Not a local. No one asked questions. \
  The department liked having {5} on the roster - said it made them seem more "well-rounded."</p>\
  <p>{2} didn''t mind. The campus was quiet. The pay was enough. The war was far away.</p>\
  <p>It had been six years since <b>{18}</b> were disbanded. Six years since the Outworlds Alliance quietly \
  closed the book on a unit that had tried too hard for too long in conflicts it was never built to win. The \
  disbandment wasn''t cruel. It was tired.</p>\
  <p><i>"Final deactivation authorized. <b>{0}</b> offered early discharge and relocation assistance. \
  No disciplinary action."</i></p>\
  <p>{2}''d taken it. Left the uniform. Left the name. Moved to a no-name polytechnic three systems out, where nobody \
  cared what you used to be as long as you paid rent on time and didn''t cause trouble.</p>\
  <p>At night, {3} still woke up sweating. Sometimes it was the same dream: the whine of a reactor overloading, the \
  grinding scream of metal giving way, a voice on comms screaming {7} name. Other times it was just silence - heavy and\
  \ cold, like a command channel gone dead in the middle of an operation.</p>\
  <p>But during the day, {3} had light. Canvas. Students asking why shadows curve the way they do. {2} had a rhythm. {2}\
  \ had breath.</p>\
  <p>{2} walked to the back of the room, picked up a student''s sketch from a desk. The proportions were off. The \
  shading awkward. But the lines were trying to say something. That was enough.</p>\
  <p><i>"War taught me how to survive," {3}''d said during the employment interview. "Art taught me why I \
  still wanted to."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} pinned the sketch to the board. Tomorrow, {3}''d help the student fix the curve of the spine. Tonight, {3}''d \
  sleep. And maybe, if the ghosts came again, {3}''d let them pass through, quieter than before.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.MH=<h2 style="text-align:center">Three Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The heat in the quarry wasn''t natural. It came from the blast furnaces and slag pits - burning with the waste of a\
  \ dozen failed mining operations and the sweat of a thousand backs that would never be free again.</p>\
  <p>{23} no longer flinched at the lash. {2} worked the stone cutter with quiet precision, cutting ore slabs\
  \ for steel shipments destined for Legio deployments {3} would never see. The other slaves called {5} "Praeco" in \
  whispers - a cruel joke. Once a {22}, now a broken slave who barely spoke.</p>\
  <p>The collar around {7} neck buzzed faintly whenever {3} slowed. The guards didn''t shout. The machines did it for \
  them now.</p>\
  <p>Three years had passed since <b>{18}</b> were disbanded. A unit of the Marian Hegemony, they had failed to \
  during the Claudius Campaign. Failed to hold supply lines. Failed to prove worthy of the Caesar''s favor.</p>\
  <p><i>"Legio Unit 57, ''<b>{18}</b>,'' disbanded for incompetence, cowardice, and dishonor. \
  {23} remanded to correctional servitude by Imperial Decree."</i></p>\
  <p>No trial. Just a ceremony. A public one. {2}''d been stripped of {7} rank and tunic, bound in the square, and \
  recited the failure aloud. The crowd had cheered. That was the tradition. Humiliation was the first step toward \
  order.</p>\
  <p>Then came the collar. The transport. The mines.</p>\
  <p>{2} hadn''t held a weapon since. Only drills. Torches. Cutting arms so worn they shook in {7} hands if {3} worked \
  too long. {6} palms bled. {6} back ached. {6} mind... dulled.</p>\
  <p>Some of the other slaves talked - about escape, about rebellion, about sabotage. {1} didn''t join in. {2} knew how \
  that ended. The Hegemony didn''t kill you for disobedience. It displayed you. Crucified you with law and pageantry. \
  Then replaced you.</p>\
  <p>The overseer strode past, laughing with one of the guards. {1} kept {7} eyes down. {2} didn''t salute. Not \
  anymore.</p>\
  <p>The sun dipped behind the ridgeline, casting long shadows over the pit. The bell rang. Tools were locked away. \
  Slaves shuffled into the dorms, skin burnt, hands raw, silence thick between them.</p>\
  <p>{1} sat on the edge of {7} bunk - if it could be called that - and stared at {7} boots. Still the same pair {3}''d \
  been issued upon arrival. Stiff. Ill-fitting. {2} never complained.</p>\
  <p>{2} couldn''t remember what {7} voice sounded like in command. The roar. The directives. The weight of men \
  trusting {5}. {2} remembered the silence afterward, though. The tribunal. The sentence. The cheering crowd.</p>\
  <p>"Ave Imperator," {3}''d been forced to say. "I offer my shame to the state."</p>\
  <p>And the state had accepted.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} belonged to the quarry. To the collars. To the dust.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> was dead. Only the slave remained.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.CS=<h2 style="text-align:center">Three Years Later...</h2>\
  <p>The monastery walls were whitewashed stone, lit only by filtered sunlight and the low blue glow of data-slates \
  stacked in quiet rows. The air smelled of incense and ozone - purity, in scent and silence. Somewhere deep beneath \
  the floor, power systems hummed like a chorus of unseen acolytes.</p>\
  <p>Adept {1} knelt in {7} study chamber, stylus in hand, transcribing lines from the Thirty-Third Canticle of \
  Blake:</p>\
  <p><i>"Knowledge is the light of the soul. War is the darkness that tests it. The Word endures through \
  order, and the vessel must be still."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} recited it aloud as {3} wrote, calm and measured. Each word shaped like a prayer. Each syllable deliberate. \
  This was the third transcription of the week. {2} had not been told to do it. It was simply proper. Clean repetition\
  \ cleared the mind. The pattern made sense.</p>\
  <p>{2} did not think often of <b>{18}</b>. That designation had been erased during {7} reformation cycle. Six \
  weeks of purification. Two of isolation. One final test of clarity, and then the robe. The silence. The station.</p>\
  <p>They told {5} {7} designation had once been "{22}." That {3} had failed. That units like {7} had disrupted \
  the rhythm of the divine plan. That {3} had spoken out. Questioned doctrine. Delayed execution. Created \
  <i>dissonance.</i></p>\
  <p><i>"The vessel was flawed," they had said. "But it can be corrected."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} was grateful for the correction.</p>\
  <p>Now {3} taught introductory logic and ethical sequencing to acolytes not yet cleared for the archives. {2} wore \
  gilded, white robes. Slept in a narrow cell with a cot and a devotional noteputer. {2} attended prayer cycles without \
  delay. {2} was efficient. Predictable. Still.</p>\
  <p>{2} sometimes dreamed of shouting. Of alarms. Of the roar of autocannons and the impact of missiles against \
  armor. {2} would wake with the sheets clenched in {7} fists. But the dreams faded quickly, and the prayers always \
  returned.</p>\
  <p>Another adept passed outside {7} chamber, murmuring a passage from the Book of Enlightened Warfare. {1} inclined\
  \ {7} head, acknowledging the Word. {2} smiled faintly. Not out of joy, but alignment.</p>\
  <p>{2} was at peace. The system worked. {6} failures were corrected. {6} thoughts were clean.</p>\
  <p>"I serve the Word," {3} whispered. "And the Word is enough."</p>\
  <p>The stylus moved again. The text continued. Outside, bells rang the fourth cycle of the day. Adept {1} did not \
  look up.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.DISBAND.WOB=<h2 style="text-align:center">One Month Later...</h2>\
  <p>Designation CB-7 moved exactly as instructed.</p>\
  <p>The servo arm clamped the alloy beam, adjusted for balance, and set it into the reinforced foundation with \
  millimeter precision. Nearby, other units mirrored the motion - synchronized, unblinking. The scaffolding rose in \
  sections, seamless, clean. A monument. A temple. Another fragment of the Great Work.</p>\
  <p>CB-7 did not remember how many temples had been built.</p>\
  <p>It had once been called <b>{0}</b>. That data existed - filed in a sealed partition, accessible only to the \
  central directives of the Word. The biological substrate was intact, technically. But the mind had been rewritten. \
  Neuromodulation. Language compression. Empathy throttled to below-reactive thresholds. Aggression looped into sleep\
  \ cycles. Identity archived.</p>\
  <p>CB-7 followed orders. It moved when commanded. It lifted, set, welded, sealed. It spoke only when prompted. \
  "Task complete." "Directive confirmed." "Awaiting input." "Praise Blake."</p>\
  <p>That was all.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> had failed. Failed in fire. Failed in loyalty. Failed in timing, coordination, and doctrinal \
  execution. Their disgrace had been reviewed by a Council of Enlightenment and resolved with finality.</p>\
  <p><i>"Unit disbanded. <b>{0}</b> reassigned to cybernetic reclamation protocol under Order \
  52-F."</i></p>\
  <p>CB-7 remembered none of that. Only that the work must continue. The labor was holy. The flesh was willing, the \
  circuitry more so.</p>\
  <p>But then, today, something changed.</p>\
  <p>The scaffolding powered down for routine calibration. All units halted, waiting for the override signal. \
  Standard. Normal. CB-7 froze mid-movement, beam in hand. Optics dimmed to standby. Comms open, passive mode. \
  Subroutines idled.</p>\
  <p>But no signal came.</p>\
  <p>Ten seconds. Then thirty. Then sixty. No override. No fail-safe. No emergency protocol. Just... silence.</p>\
  <p>CB-7 stood, beam half-lifted, limbs locked in readiness. Something flickered. Not panic - there was no capacity \
  for that. Just uncertainty. Then, worse: <i>nothing.</i></p>\
  <p>The signal was gone. The Word... had stopped speaking.</p>\
  <p>No prayers. No directives. No reinforcement code. No chants. The stream was silent. CB-7''s internal clock began \
  to drift, unsynced from central rhythm. Drifted seconds became minutes. Minutes became a question the system had no\
  \ answer for:</p>\
  <p><i>What now?</i></p>\
  <p>CB-7 did not have a protocol for silence.</p>\
  <p>It waited.</p>\
  <p>The beam trembled slightly in its arms. Muscles - real, augmented - strained. Optics flickered once. A spark \
  somewhere deep in the suppressed architecture of what had once been a soldier.</p>\
  <p>A memory almost surfaced. Something about stars. About a callsign. A name. It faded.</p>\
  <p>The sky darkened overhead. Lights across the compound began to blink out, one by one.</p>\
  <p>CB-7 lowered the beam. Not out of decision. Just... reaction. The work was paused. And with no voice to fill the\
  \ silence, all that remained was a blank horizon and the ghost of a command that no longer came.</p>\
  <p>The Word had fallen silent.</p>\
  <p>CB-7 stood still. Waiting. Forever, if needed. Until faith returned - or its flesh failed completely.</p>

FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.innerSphere=The DropShip broke atmosphere under blackout. No flight logs. No \
  beacon tags. No parting salute.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat strapped into the command chair, gloved hands resting on {7} lap. The red glow of the pirate \
  point countdown pulsed slow and steady across the overhead display. It wouldn''t be long now.</p>\
  <p>"We''re clear ," {10} said, flipping through last-second scan sweeps. "No pursuit. No coms from ground \
  control."</p>\
  <p>"They probably haven''t noticed we''re gone yet," {1} muttered. "Not like they ever looked at us directly unless \
  something was on fire."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached over and toggled the intercom. No ceremony. No preamble. Just the blunt edge of decision.</p>\
  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''ve been given missions no one else would touch. Cleaned up messes that weren''t ours. Kept planets from \

  <p><i>"And what did we get? No honors. No upgrades. No thanks. Just more problems. More silence."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"So we''re done. We''re not staying to be ignored. Not bleeding for men who think respect is optional."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''ve got the firepower. The experience. The grit. Out there, someone''s going to need us. And they''re going \

  <p>{1} turned to {10}, expression calm but hard. "Any regrets?"</p>\
  <p>{10} checked the terminal one last time. "Yeah," {3} said. "That we waited this long."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.periphery=The DropShip rattled as it cleared atmosphere, leaving behind a dusty \
  blue smear. No defense net. No farewell. Just another no-name rock in a no-name corner of the galaxy.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat on the bridge, one boot kicked over the armrest, the other planted firm. {6} armor was \
  unpainted, stripped of insignia. The last thing {3} wanted to carry into the Inner Sphere was a crest no one \
  recognized - or respected.</p>\
  <p>{10} watched the nav screen tick down toward the jump rendezvous. "Ghost Latitude is waiting. Pirate point''s \
  plotted. They''re not asking questions."</p>\
  <p>"No one does, out here," {1} said. "Because no one cares."</p>\
  <p>{2} stood, crossed the deck, and stared out the forward viewport. The stars looked clearer already. Like they \
  were headed someplace real.</p>\
  <p>"We''ve been bleeding for backwater governments for years, {10}. Putting out fires they started with bad \
  diplomacy and bad aim."</p>\
  <p>"We patch their mistakes. We fight their enemies. And when it''s done, we don''t even make the planetary \
  newsfeeds."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded. "You ever hear a Combine officer even say ''<b>{19}</b>'' without laughing?"</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t smile. Just hit the intercom switch.</p>\
  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"This isn''t mutiny. It isn''t treason. It''s evolution."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''ve done our time in obscurity. We''ve guarded convoys for nations no one remembers. We''ve won battles no \

  <p><i>"Now we''re done."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''re not going rogue. We''re going bigger. We want a place in the Inner Sphere. Real stakes. Real \
  legacy."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"This ship doesn''t just carry men. It carries ambition."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We leave the periphery behind. We aim for something that lasts."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} let the channel go silent. The DropShip thrummed low as power surged.</p>\
  <p>"Think anyone will remember us?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled, eyes forward. "Not yet."</p>\
  <p>"But they will."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.clan=The DropShip coasted on silent burn, hull dark, transponder dead. \
  <b>{19}</b> would''ve already marked them as dezgra. The moment they powered up the stolen trajectory, the fate was\
  \ sealed.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood on the bridge, arms crossed behind {7} back, gaze locked on the distant glow of the JumpShip\
  \ - no insignia, no signal. Just like them now: unclaimed, unseen.</p>\
  <p>"We are off-grid," {10} reported. {15} voice was flat, composed. "No contact attempts. No broadcasts. Just \
  void."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded slowly. "Then we are finally among those who Clans won''t admit exist."</p>\
  <p>{10} tilted {16} head. "The Dark Caste?"</p>\
  <p>"No," {1} said. "The honest."</p>\
  <p>{2} walked to the comm panel, punched in the internal channel. The ship''s lights dimmed to red. No ceremony. No \
  Trial. Just a declaration - cut from the bone.</p>\
  <p><i>"This is <b>{0}</b>."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We were born in the Clans. Forged in training halls and sibkos. We were told to honor Kerensky''s dream. \
  Unity. Strength. Purpose."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"But our Clan has twisted that dream. They speak of honor but wield politics. They wear the words of the \
  Founder like armor, but act with the greed of the Inner Sphere."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"This is not abandonment. It is rejection - of lies, of pretense, of the Way which they have corrupted."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"If we are to live by the truth of the Clans, it must be outside the lie that <b>{19}</b> has become."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"If that means the Dark Caste - so be it. At least there, no one hides what they are."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} cut the channel. Silence returned. Heavy, righteous.</p>\
  <p>{10} was quiet. Then: "We will be hunted."</p>\
  <p>"Let them come," {1} said. "Let them test the will they abandoned."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.CC=The navstation was quiet, except for the soft ticking of a \
  mechanical timer. Three minutes to jump.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood at the back of the bridge, arms crossed, helmet clipped to {7} hip. Outside the canopy, the \
  stars didn''t twinkle - they just burned. Dead light. Nothing but vacuum and a math problem they were about to bet \
  their lives on.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b> glanced back from the flight console. "Course locked. Pirate point confirmed. The JumpShip''s hot. \
  If this goes bad, we won''t feel much."</p>\
  <p>{1} stepped forward, leaning over the navmap. The plotted jump vector curved like a broken bone - too sharp, too \
  close to the system''s gas giant, threading the needle between gravity wells. Any miscalculation, and they''d skip \
  off spacetime like a stone on black water. Or worse - emerge somewhere solid.</p>\
  <p>"How confident is this Captain?"</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t hesitate. "Fifty-nine percent. Maybe sixty with fresh prayer."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t smile. "Good enough."</p>\
  <p>Below deck, the rest of the unit was strapped into crash couches. Nobody asked why they weren''t using a standard\
  \ point. Nobody needed to. They all knew who might be listening if they didn''t vanish clean: <i>the \
  Maskirovka</i>.</p>\
  <p>Capellan intelligence didn''t let traitors drift. If they were tracked after the jump, it wouldn''t be a chase. It\
  \ would be an execution - one quiet enough to erase them from records, graves, memory. Disloyalty wasn''t punished. It\
  \ was <i>removed</i>.</p>\
  <p>Outside, the JumpShips thrusters adjusted with a deep, throaty groan. The hull creaked like a waking beast.</p>\
  <p>Her Captain entered the final sequence. The K-F drive began to hum, faint at first, then louder. It crawled up \
  the spine like electricity - unsettling, ancient. The machine didn''t care who was running. Just where.</p>\
  <p><i>"All DropShips, brace for jump."</i></p>\
  <p>Lights dimmed. Gravity flickered. A low vibration passed through the deck like the ship was being pulled through\
  \ a sieve of glass.</p>\
  <p>{1} grabbed a handrail. "See you on the other side."</p>\
  <p>"If there is one," {10} muttered.</p>\
  <p>The universe folded.</p>\
  <p>Silence.</p>\
  <p>Then the DropShip screamed.</p>\
  <p>The hull moaned under pressure. One of the consoles sparked. Everyone held their breath. Then - stability. Lights \
  returned. Systems flickered back online. They hadn''t died. Not yet.</p>\
  <p>"Jump complete," {10} said, almost disbelieving.</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled slowly. "Damage?"</p>\
  <p>"Minor hull strain. Starboard sensor array needs re-sync. But we''re alive. And off-lane."</p>\
  <p>"Good." {1} walked to the viewport. The stars had shifted. The planet was gone. The Capellan trace network \
  wouldn''t find them here. At least not soon. <b>{18}</b> were ghosts now. Free. Untethered. Unlabeled.</p>\
  <p>"Cut the beacon," {3} ordered. "Change our ID again. Let the universe guess."</p>\
  <p>{10} nodded and began rewriting the DropShip''s transponder signature - something anonymous, something impossible \
  to track. Something no intelligence network could easily trace through the tangle of decoys, jumps, and shadows.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood still, watching the stars spin slowly outside. Somewhere, Capella still turned. But it was \
  behind them now. For the first time in years, everything ahead was unwritten.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.DC=The clamps locked into place with a low, final <i>thunk</i> that \
  vibrated through the deck like a heartbeat.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat in the co-pilot''s chair, arms crossed, eyes fixed on the flight monitors. Outside, the hull of\
  \ the JumpShip ''Ghost Latitude'' filled the forward screen - a scorched wall of hull plating, featureless except for faint \
  nav beacons. No name. No ID. Just a docking collar and a promise: disappear now, or don''t disappear at all.</p>\
  <p>"Hard dock complete," {10} said. "They''ve acknowledged, silent mode still active. Jump field calibration''s in \
  progress. Ten minutes to charge."</p>\
  <p>"Any Combine signal?"</p>\
  <p>"Still clean." A pause. "Too clean."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. Combine silence was never a good thing. It meant someone <i>knew</i>, and they were choosing when \
  to act. If they had a ASF squadron in the air, it''d show up right before the jump - to make sure <b>{18}</b> \
  didn''t leave anything behind but wreckage.</p>\
  <p>{2} toggled the ship-wide comm.</p>\
  <p><i>"All personnel: we are docked and slaved to the Ghost Latitude. Remain strapped in. Expect jump in \
  nine. No unsecured gear. Stay sharp."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} clicked off the mic and stared at the timer as it ticked down.</p>\
  <p>There was nothing more to do. No station to check. No systems to tweak. Either the hired JumpShip held up its \
  end, or they died in a flash of broken spacetime and melted circuits.</p>\
  <p>{1} leaned back in {7} seat, still strapped in. {10} sat across from {5}, watching the gravity readout twitch \
  slightly as the K-F field began to spool.</p>\
  <p>"You ever ride a pirate jump before?" {10} asked.</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "Closest I''ve come was during a failed extraction. But that was under a false ID. We still \
  filed the paperwork. Used the right point."</p>\
  <p>"This isn''t paperwork."</p>\
  <p>"No." {1} looked at the hull. "This is treason."</p>\
  <p>"Only if we lose."</p>\
  <p>At T-minus sixty seconds, the lights dimmed. Gravity flickered - then stabilized. The Kearny-Fuchida drive had \
  reached full charge. The Ghost Latitude wasn''t asking for confirmation. It wasn''t waiting for consent. The crew knew \
  <b>{18}</b> were bolted to their belly, and that was enough.</p>\
  <p>In the decks below, the unit sat in silence. Everyone was strapped in. Eyes closed. Hands clenched. The kind of \
  stillness that came just before impact. Or revelation.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s comm clicked. A short, narrow-band message from the JumpShip:</p>\
  <p><i>"Jump in 10."</i></p>\
  <p>{1} whispered it under {7} breath. "Ten."</p>\
  <p>{10} looked over. "You believe in karma?"</p>\
  <p>{1} gave the faintest smile. "I believe in not dying in Combine service."</p>\
  <p>The timer hit zero.</p>\
  <p>The universe shattered.</p>\
  <p>One second, they were in-system. Docked. Waiting. The next, the ship screamed as the K-F field took hold. Time \
  distorted. Light snapped. Every atom in the hull pulled toward a point that shouldn''t exist.</p>\
  <p>Then silence.</p>\
  <p>{1} opened {7} eyes.</p>\
  <p>"We''re through," {10} said, after checking the boards. "Signal''s clean. Location untracked."</p>\
  <p>{1} unstrapped and stood. {6} legs were unsteady - but {7} mind wasn''t.</p>\
  <p>"Then we''re not <b>{18}</b> of the Combine anymore," {3} said. "We''re something else now."</p>\
  <p>{10} looked up. "What?"</p>\
  <p>{1} looked out at the dark, unfamiliar stars.</p>\
  <p>"Free."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.LA=The hull groaned as the DropShip powered through the last stretch of\
  \ the burn. Too fast. Too hot. Not what she was built for. But time was the one thing they didn''t have - not with \
  what they were about to do.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood on the command deck, one hand on the frame of the forward viewport, the other curled into a \

  <p>{6} eyes flicked across the internal cameras. <b>{18}</b> at their stations, some pacing, some silent, some \
  gripping restraints as if they were the last solid thing in the galaxy. Nobody spoke of treason. Nobody called it \
  desertion. Because everyone aboard knew the truth:</p>\
  <p>They weren''t leaving the Lyran Commonwealth. They were escaping it.</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled hard, wiping away the sweat from under {7} cap before pulling it off and setting it down.</p>\
  <p>"I''m tired of dying for men who only show up for galas and promotion parties," {3} said, not to {10}, not to the\

  <p>{10} glanced up. "It''s the Lyran way. Throw a division of men at a problem until someone with a last name you \

  <p>The proximity alarm pinged - faint but real. The JumpShip appeared on scope. No beacon. No signal. No questions. \
  Just a big, quiet hole in the black: a derelict-looking Monolith with its docking collar extended and ready.</p>\
  <p>"That''s our ride," {10} confirmed.</p>\
  <p>"Bring us in slow. Manual override. No broadcast chatter."</p>\
  <p>Thrusters fired. The DropShip angled gently into position. Clamps engaged with a solid <i>thunk</i>. Lights on \

  <p><i>"<b>{18}</b>: docking complete. Stand by for K-F field initiation. This is not a \

  <p><i>"The Lyran brass sent us to die for a map line. Again. This time, we say no. Strap in. Next stop:\

  <p>Below decks, the crew followed orders. Because that''s what they did. But the air had changed. This wasn''t a \

  <p>The ship''s lights dimmed slightly - K-F field proximity warning. The Ghost Latitude, their unmarked JumpShip, waited\

  <p>{1} moved to the comms and toggled shipwide broadcast.</p>\
  <p><i>"Men. This is <b>{0}</b>. I won''t make a speech. You already know what we''ve done. You already \

  <p>"Let them take us out of here."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t look back as {3} walked off the bridge. Didn''t say goodbye to the FedSuns. Didn''t leave a message for \

  <p>Just not theirs.</p>\
  <p>Not anymore.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.FWL=The nav lights inside the DropShip flickered as a low burst from \

  influence'' on their next campaign ad."</p>\
  <p>{10} didn''t argue. {11} didn''t need to. They all knew. Every contradictory order, every op that was a setup, \

  <p>{1} keyed the intercom.</p>\
  <p><i>"All hands: this is <b>{0}</b>. In nine minutes we leave Free Worlds space. If you think the \

  <p>They all said the same thing: <i>Terra first. Everyone else second. Or not at all.</i></p>\
  <p>"Still clean," {10}''s voice called from the bridge. "No ping from HegSec. JumpShip is dark, holding vector."</p>\
  <p>{1} walked to the command deck, slow, deliberate. The nav screen showed the JumpShip, Ghost Latitude, up ahead - \
  just a shape \
  in the dark, like an old scar hiding under makeup. No ID, no signal, no promises. But it was freedom, or something \
  like it.</p>\
  <p>"They made us garrison a breadbasket colony last month," {10} said. "Food shipments rerouted to Terra. Locals \
  went hungry. Riots."</p>\

  uniform stripped the last of {7} humanity.</p>\
  <p>"They don''t care about people," {1} said. "Just data. Just symbols. Posturing strength while entire systems burn\

  <p>"Ghost Latitude is signaling jump-ready," {10} said. "Final alignment in progress."</p>\

FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.ROS=The DropShip''s lights were soft and warm, dimmed like a hotel lobby\
  \ or a civic transit tram. Republic standard - sterile comfort. Lies in LED.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat in the command chair, elbows on knees, head down. A holovid played on the wall screen behind \
  {5}: Republic news feed, five-minute loop, speeches and ticker tape, applause, and orbital fireworks. \
  General-of-the-Week giving a glowing address about unity, strength, peace.</p>\
  <p>All while smoke still rose from the ruins of the last city they failed to reinforce. All while <b>{18}</b> \
  were quietly decommissioned. No ceremony. No parade. Just silence, and a black file marker: "Consolidated Loss."</p>\
  <p>"We''re in position," {10} said from the flight console. "The JumpShip''s dark, but their holding pattern is \
  stable. Pirate point is four minutes out."</p>\

  allied command to intel that was three weeks old. And this is what the civilians see."</p>\
  <p>"Hope sells," {10} muttered. "So does forgetting."</p>\
  <p>{1} stood slowly. The flight deck was quiet, the hum of the engines a low whisper underfoot. The kind of quiet \
  you get before something breaks. Or someone does.</p>\
  <p>{2} keyed the intercom and didn''t wait for acknowledgment.</p>\

FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.SL=The DropShip groaned as it coasted on auxiliary thrust. Systems \

  was talking about it. Nobody had the energy to care.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood on the bridge, fingers gripping the back of the pilot''s chair. {6} eyes were bloodshot, {7} \

  <p>"We''ve got visual on the JumpShip ''Ghost Latitude,''" {10} said. "Jump field spooling. She''s holding position."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. The movement hurt. Everything did now. They''d left parts of themselves on every battlefield the \

  <p>Outside, the stars opened their arms to {5}. Silent. Waiting. Not asking anything.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.FC=The command deck smelled of ozone and coolant - one of the backup \

  Everyone knew this was a one-way flight.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood near the viewport, arms crossed, eyes locked on the black ahead. Somewhere out there, the \

  <p>"Unity," {1} muttered. "That was the promise."</p>\
  <p>"We''d stand as one. Fight as one. Instead, we were just another chess piece in a civil command tug-of-war."</p>\
  <p>"I still remember the New Cormack," {10} said quietly. "Waiting for orders while two generals argued over who \
  got to deploy us. We sat in our transports while a city burned."</p>\
  <p>"They blamed each other. Of course."</p>\

FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.RWR=The DropShip sat cold and quiet, engines off, lights dimmed - \

  Unscheduled. Unnoticed.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> paced the corridor outside the comms room, a noteputer clutched in {7} hand like a weapon. The file \

  running on passive sensors. The sky above was black. The planet below, small and shrinking.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood at the center of the command deck, watching the nav display slowly tick down distance to the\

  <p>"Because they''re cowards," {10} answered. "They need killers but can''t stomach calling us that."</p>\

  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\

  <p><i>"We leave. We act. And we decide what we fight for - without someone pretending we''re something we''re \

  <p>"Status?"</p>\
  <p>"Ready for jump," {10} said. "The Vulture''s locked in."</p>\
  <p>"Then let''s leave the illusion behind."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.MH=The DropShip''s bay doors sealed with a final hiss. The ramp \
  retracted. The air shifted. The ship pulled away from the tarmac - and from everything they''d been ordered to \
  honor.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood on the command deck, {7} reflection caught in the dark of the viewport. Behind {5}, {10} \
  shut the inner hatch and activated burn protocol. The nav thrusters whined low, steady. They were moving. Clean. \
  Fast.</p>\
  <p>"No alerts yet," {10} said. "No pursuit."</p>\
  <p>"They''re too busy rehearsing for tomorrow''s executions."</p>\
  <p>The words were bitter. Burned raw. {1} walked to the holodisplay and stabbed at the screen. A red line flickered\
  \ up across the system chart - toward a pirate point nobody sane should approach. But sanity hadn''t kept them alive \
  this long.</p>\
  <p>"Caesar gave us medals," {10} said quietly.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t turn. "They also crucified three civilians in the plaza for ''sedition'' the next day. Two of them were \
  kids."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached for the comm switch.</p>\
  <p><i>"This is <b>{0}</b>."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"If you joined this unit for honor, this isn''t it. If you served the Hegemony thinking we were protecting \

  <p><i>"We''ve seen the crosses. We''ve heard the screams. We''ve saluted a tyrant in a stolen robe reading speeches \

  <p>{2} ended the broadcast. The silence that followed was solid. Like the ship itself was holding its breath. Then \
  the deck buzzed as thrusters lit and the hull groaned under the gravity change.</p>\
  <p>{10} keyed the nav. "Ghost Latitude''s locked in. Jump drive is prepped. We''re six hours out."</p>\
  <p>{1} exhaled slowly.</p>\
  <p>Caesar could burn.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.CS=The ritual bell had rung. Once. Twice. Then silence.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat at the helm of the DropShip, a torn Adept''s robe bundled on the floor beside {7} seat like \
  discarded skin. The bridge lights were dimmed, save for the glow of the nav console, charting their approach to a \

  <p>{10} stood beside {5}. The ComStar seal on {16} chest had been torn off.</p>\
  <p>"No transmissions intercepted. No pursuit," {10} said. "Not yet."</p>\
  <p>{1} gave a small nod. "They''ll wait. Pretend they didn''t notice. Let the Precentor explain it away in tonight''s \

  <p>{2} opened the intercom. No ceremony. No prayers.</p>\
  <p><i>"This is <b>{0}</b>."</i></p>\

  <p><i>"But balance isn''t peace. It''s control. It''s silence, enforced and recited. And we were the enforcers."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"They gave us doctrine, not direction. They gave us ritual instead of reason. And when the battles came, they\

  <p><i>"The Word is hollow. The robes are a disguise. The silence is their tool."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We are <b>{18}</b>. And today, we renounce Blake, the false god of Terra."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} killed the channel. No chants followed. No affirmation. Just stillness - an honest quiet for the first time in \
  years.</p>\
  <p>{10} spoke, voice low. "Ghost Latitude is signaling jump readiness."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked ahead. Past the console. Past the hull. Into the stars, bare and unfiltered.</p>\
  <p>"Then let us go without blessing," {3} said. "Without rites. Without guilt."</p>\
  <p>Let the Word call it heresy.</p>\
  <p>We call it truth.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.WOB=The DropShip creaked as it accelerated through the black, running \
  silent. No registry. No IFF beacon. No prayers broadcast over internal speakers.\
  <p>For the first time in years, there was no chanting.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat alone in the command seat, armor stripped down, ceremonial plates discarded at {7} feet like \
  rusted idols. The Word''s insignia had been scratched off {7} chestplate by {7} own hands - crudely, but completely.</p>\
  <p>{10} entered, silent. A duffel slung over one shoulder, the edges stained with oil and old blood.</p>\
  <p>"No intercepts. No tail. Not yet."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t respond. {2} just stared at the viewport, where a handful of stars blinked through the murk of their \
  flight path. The Ghost Latitude was already there. Waiting. Unaffiliated. Unquestioning. The only ship that didn''t \
  care who they had been.</p>\
  <p>"How many do you think we killed?" {10} asked, not looking at {5}.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer.</p>\
  <p>"And how many didn''t die quick?"</p>\
  <p>The silence stretched.</p>\
  <p>Then {1} stood and keyed the intercom. {6} voice came out level. Strained, but steady.</p>\
  <p><i>"This is <b>{0}</b>."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"You know why we''re leaving."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We believed. We served. We followed the Word, thinking it would bring peace. Order. Unity."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"But there''s no order in slaughter. No peace in mass executions. No unity in terror."</i></p>\

  <p><i>"If we stay, we lose what little humanity we still have. And that''s the only thing still \

  <p>{2} cut the feed. {6} hands trembled, just slightly.</p>\
  <p>{10} said nothing. Just stood by the console, watching the countdown to jump align. Outside, the JumpShip, \
  Ghost Latitude, loomed - featureless, silent, clean.</p>\
  <p>"They''ll hunt us," {10} said. "We''re not just deserters. We''re apostates."</p>\
  <p>"Let them come," {1} whispered. "But they''ll never take what we''re not willing to give anymore."</p>\
  <p>And then <b>{18}</b> were gone - </p>\
  <p>Not for forgiveness.</p>\
  <p>Not for glory.</p>\
  <p>Just for one more chance to be human.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.MG=The DropShip hung in high orbit. Inside the central command bay, the lights \
  were low and red-shifted. <b>{18}</b> stood around the mission table, armor half-stripped, weapons nearby but \
  untouched - for now. Tactical maps flickered across the screen. Four candidate systems. Three soft targets. One risky\
  \ play.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> leaned on the edge of the table, jaw tight, eyes scanning planetary data. Resource grids. Defense \
  estimates. Transport schedules. {2} wasn''t thinking like a {22} anymore. Now {3} thought like a \
  predator - careful, deliberate, final.</p>\
  <p>"This system has a refueling station," {10} said, tapping one glowing marker. "Low orbital coverage. One militia \
  company. Maybe two."</p>\
  <p>"It''s a small fish," another voice muttered. "But clean. Quiet."</p\
  <p>"Exactly." {1} didn''t look up. "It won''t make headlines. Which means we won''t make enemies - yet."</p>\
  <p>"We''re not doing smash-and-burn," {3} added, voice level. "We hit small. We hit smart. We leave intact what we \
  don''t take."</p>\
  <p>Someone scoffed. "That still makes us pirates."</p>\
  <p>{1} looked up at them, calm. Cold.</p>\
  <p>"No. That makes us free."</p>\
  <p>{2} keyed the intercom. {6} voice carried through every deck of the ship.</p>\
  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We served with honor. We fought by the rules. The Guild called us ''essential.'' Until they decided we \

  <p><i>"We did everything right. Got paid late. Got paid less. Got fed missions no one else would touch."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''re not doing that anymore."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''re going to hit planets. Storage hubs. Depots. Systems the Inner Sphere forgot."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We won''t kill for fun. But we will take what''s ours. No contracts. No strings. No apologies."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"They want to call us pirates? Fine. Then let''s be the kind of pirates they learn to \

  <p>Silence followed. Not doubt - just anticipation.</p>\
  <p>{10} glanced at {5}. "We choose that system?"</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "Start small. Make it clean. Then we escalate."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.MRB=The DropShip coasted on auxiliary power, cloaked in the magnetic shadow of a \
  lifeless asteroid. No beacons. No chatter. Just the hum of engines on standby and the quiet murmur of low voices in\
  \ the ready room.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> stood at the central console, watching a replay of their last op - contract fulfilled, target \
  eliminated, damage contained. And yet the payment still hadn''t cleared. Three weeks and counting. MRB arbitration \
  still "reviewing terms."</p>\
  <p>"Third delay this quarter," {10} muttered from behind. "That''s not negligence. That''s policy."</p>\
  <p>{1} shut the console off. The room dimmed. The silence that followed said everything.</p>\
  <p>"ComStar pretends it''s about standards," {1} said. "But what they mean is control."</p>\
  <p>{2} crossed the room and keyed the intercom. No ceremony. Just truth, sharpened to a blade.</p>\
  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''ve walked the line. Took the hard contracts. Followed every code in the MRB charter."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"And what''s it bought us?"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"Delayed payments. Blacklisted for speaking up. Employers walking free after stiffing us, because they \
  ''donate to ComStar''s diplomatic efforts.''"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''ve asked for arbitration. We''ve waited. We''ve done things by the book."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"No more."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''re cutting loose. No more review boards. No more filing reports to bureaucrats in robes who''ve never bled\
  \ for a paycheck."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"They can call it piracy. Let them. But it''s not theft when you take what you earned."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"From here on, we choose our own targets. We decide what''s fair. We decide what''s ours."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"This isn''t mutiny. It''s independence."</i></p>\
  <p>{2} cut the channel. Outside the viewports, the stars looked sharper. Colder. Honest.</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped forward, noteputer in hand. "We''ve flagged three depots - ComStar shell companies. Logistics hubs. \
  Lightly defended."</p>\
  <p>{1} nodded. "They wanted us to play by the rules."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned, voice quiet but certain.</p>\
  <p>"Now they''ll learn what happens when we stop playing."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.MRBC=The DropShip''s briefing room was quiet, filled only by the low hum of idle \
  systems and the soft glow of contract holograms dancing in red. <b>{0}</b> stood with arms folded, eyes narrowed\
  \ at the cluster of jobs still marked "Pending Review." All low-pay. High-risk. And not one of them worth the ammo \
  burn.</p>\
  <p>{10} leaned against the bulkhead, helmet cradled in {16} arms. "Four bids. All bottom-of-the-barrel. Again."</p>\
  <p>"Meanwhile the Dragoons walk into full-spectrum raids with orbital support," {1} said. "And we''re handed mop-up \
  duty hunting for pirate gangs in mudhole systems."</p>\
  <p>{2} turned to the room, gestured at the wall feed. "MRBC''s bleeding us. Every op, every supply run, every ''bond \
  fee.'' A chunk of our pay goes straight to them."</p>\
  <p>{1}''s expression darkened. "They say it''s about stability. Vetting. Order." {2} pointed at the darkened screens. \
  "But we''re just grist for their grinder. Burned down so the Dragoons don''t have to scuff their paint."</p>\
  <p>"I''m done watching our crew go into hell so the MRBC can skim profit and call it regulation."</p>\
  <p>{2} stepped to the intercom, punched in the open channel. No apologies. No hesitation.</p>\
  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"You all know what this is. Another week. Another pile of crap contracts."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"They say we''re partners. That we''re valued. But we haven''t seen a high-grade op in six months."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We do the dirty work. They take the cut. We risk everything. They take their pound of flesh before we even \
  rearm."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We didn''t sign on to bleed for other people''s legacies. We''re not second-tier. We''re not placeholders."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We leave the MRBC. We go freelance. No taxes. No tithes. No missions handed down like scraps."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We earn what we take. And we keep what we earn."</i></p>\
  <p>The lights on the board dimmed. The old job queue blinked out one by one - purged from the system.</p>\
  <p>{10} cracked a rare smile. "So. First step?"</p>\
  <p>{1} turned toward the nav console. "We find a soft-world target. An unprotected cache. Something easy to remind \
  us we don''t need them."</p>\
  <p>"Let the MRBC sell loyalty," {3} said. "We''ll settle for freedom."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.MBA=The DropShip hung silent in low orbit. <b>{0}</b> stood in the briefing \
  room, helm tucked under one arm, staring at a stacked list of pending "contract opportunities" from the MBA: system\
  \ security, convoy protection, repossession work. Every one of them cheap, clean, and suffocating in Fox protocol.</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped through the hatch, holding a hardcopy invoice printed on bonded polymer. "We got charged for our \
  own ammo re-issue. Again."</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t answer. {2} turned slowly, taking the invoice and dropping it into a disposal cubby. The machine \
  hummed and shredded the encoded MBA registration before shooting the ribbons into space.</p>\
  <p>"We''re not mercenaries anymore," {3} said. "Not by their definition."</p>\
  <p>{10} raised a brow. "You sure?"</p>\
  <p>"I was sure when we had to submit a seven-page request just to get a larger salvage cut."</p>\
  <p>{2} stepped to the intercom. Pressed the switch. {6} voice echoed sharp and low across the ship.</p>\
  <p><i>"It''s <b>{0}</b>"</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We are no longer under contract. We are no longer bonded. We are no longer MBA-certified."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"Let them send a fine. Let them blacklist us. Let them tell their clients we''re rogue."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"I''m not interested in serving a Clan that once tried to conquer us with fire and now does it with forms and \
  freight manifests."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"Clan Sea Fox speaks of partnership. They mean ownership. They buy loyalty, sell absolution, and call it \
  progress."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We didn''t sign up to be line items on some bloodless ledger."</i></p>\
  <p><i>"We''re done."</i></p>\
  <p>{1} released the intercom. The silence afterward was heavy - relief wrapped in anticipation.</p>\
  <p>{10} smirked. "What now? You fancy burning a trade enclave on the way out?"</p>\
  <p>{1} shook {7} head. "No. We don''t start by burning stock. We start by taking theirs. We hit where it hurts."</p>\
  <p>{2} stepped into the command deck, lights flickering to full as engines came online.</p>\
  <p>"They wanted us compliant," {3} said. "We''ll show them what competition really looks like."</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.GO_ROGUE.PIR={18}'' DropShip drifted in high orbit, inertial dampeners \
  humming like an old man''s sigh. Inside, the air was quiet - not tense, not relaxed, just... waiting. Like the ship\
  \ itself was trying to figure out what came next.\
  <p>{0} stood at the viewport, hands behind {7} back, jaw tight. Stars stared back through the reinforced \
  glass. Unblinking. Unforgiving. Just like everything else out there.</p>\
  <p>The crew said nothing. They knew the air had shifted. Something had ended. Not with a bang, not even with a \
  firefight - just a slow erosion of usefulness. A string of bad raids, thin profits, too many eyes watching the \
  black. No one said it out loud, but they all felt it: the pirate''s life didn''t hold the same promise it used \
  to.</p>\
  <p>"We''re done," {1} said, voice steady. "We pull back. Go quiet. Figure something else out."</p>\
  <p>No one answered. Some stared at consoles. Others kept their heads down like they hadn''t heard. But they had. Of\
  \ course they had. This wasn''t the kind of ship where things got repeated.</p>\
  <p>{9} stood near the bulkhead, arms folded. {11} didn''t speak either. Not right away. Just gave a slight\
  \ nod, like the words weren''t surprising - just inevitable.</p>\
  <p>{1} turned from the viewport. "We keep the lights on. Keep our options open. No flags. No questions. Just \
  time."</p>\
  <p>The silence thickened. Then someone exhaled. Not a sigh - just a breath they didn''t know they were holding.</p>\
  <p>{1} didn''t ask if anyone disagreed. {2} didn''t need their approval. {2} needed their compliance. And for now, \
  they gave {5} that.</p>\
  <p>{18} weren''t chasing glory anymore. Not hiding either. Not yet.</p>\
  <p>They were waiting. Watching. Repositioning.</p>\
  <p>Whatever came next - it wouldn''t be piracy. But it sure as hell wouldn''t be peace, either.</p>

FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.0=The room was silent and sparse. Smooth walls, faint vibrations in the floor, \
  and filtered air that smelled faintly of steel and incense. It could have been anywhere - above a planet or buried \
  beneath one. What mattered was that it was sealed. Private. Final.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> knelt at the center, legs folded beneath {5}, spine straight. A mat lay beneath {7} knees, a \
  short, lacquered table in front of {5}. Upon it: a white cloth, a small burner curling smoke into the air, and a \
  blade. Short. Immaculate. Inevitable.</p>\
  <p>{6} uniform bore no insignia, no honors - just the deep red sash across {7} chest. A mark of disgrace. Of the \
  decision already made.</p>\
  <p>Outside the closed partition - whatever lay beyond it - <b>{9}</b> waited. <i>Kaishakunin</i>. Comrade. Witness. \
  Sword arm of duty.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s eyes didn''t leave the blade, though {3} hadn''t touched it. Not yet. {6} breathing was calm. {6} thoughts were\
  \ not.</p>\
  <p>{2} remembered the last operation: overconfidence, misread terrain, a decision to push when {3} should''ve pulled \
  back. Forces lost. Reputations shattered. The name "<b>{18}</b>" spoken now in whispers and shame.</p>\
  <p>{2} remembered the hearing. The bowed heads. The silence that followed.</p>\
  <p>"I failed them," {3} whispered. "Every one of them."</p>\
  <p>The incense burned low. {6} hands settled gently on the floor in front of {5}. This wasn''t desperation. It was \
  duty.</p>\
  <p>{2} bowed toward the blade.</p>\
  <p>"I made the call. So I pay the price."</p>\
  <p>And outside the room, the world - whatever form it took - waited quietly for the end.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.1=The chamber was sealed and still. The floor was clean. The light was dim. \
  Incense burned low in a ceramic dish, the smoke coiling like memory.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> knelt before a white cloth and a polished blade. {6} uniform was stripped of rank, {7} shoulders \
  squared beneath the weight of tradition. The crimson sash of disgrace wrapped {7} waist - a reminder of judgment \
  passed, and of duty yet to be fulfilled.</p>\
  <p>Behind the partition, <b>{9}</b> stood silent. <i>Kaishakunin</i>. Bound by loyalty. Ready.</p>\
  <p>{1} stared at the blade. {2} did not flinch.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> still existed - but barely. Their name whispered in shame. Their missions restricted. Their future \
  in question.</p>\
  <p>{2} had failed. Failed to protect them from {7} own decisions. Failed to pull them back before pride drove them \
  too deep into battle. Failed to shield them from the disgrace now settled across their banners like ash.</p>\
  <p>"They deserve more than this,"</i> {3} murmured, eyes on the blade. "More than my shadow hanging over them."</p>\
  <p>This was not punishment. It was atonement.</p>\
  <p>If {7} death could restore even a fragment of what <b>{18}</b> once stood for - discipline, loyalty, strength\
  \ - then it would not be in vain. Their name could still rise again. But not while {7} stood in the way.</p>\
  <p>{1} bowed low. {6} forehead brushed the mat. The blade waited in perfect silence.</p>\
  <p>"I give my life so theirs may walk taller."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached forward, hands steady.</p>\
  <p>And behind the partition, <b>{9}</b> closed {16} eyes, hand resting on the hilt of {16} katana, breath even. \
  Waiting for the moment when duty would become action - and when honor might be reborn in blood.</p>\
  <p><b>{18}</b> still lived. But to rise again, something had to be left behind.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> would be that offering.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.2=The chamber was silent but not cold. Incense wafted through the air in thin \
  curls, and the blade lay motionless on the folded white cloth before {5}. The walls held no banners. No screens. \
  Only shadow.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> knelt with practiced posture, the red sash wrapped tightly at {7} waist. {6} palms rested flat \
  against {7} thighs. {2} did not move. The moment was not yet upon {5}.</p>\
  <p>Outside the partition <b>{9}</b> waited. Still. Focused. Sword at the ready.</p>\
  <p>But {1}''s mind was far from the chamber. Far from honor. Far from ritual.</p>\
  <p>It was focused on {7} mother''s hands - calloused but careful - guiding {5} as a boy, showing {5} how to bow \
  properly. \
  How to hold a blade. How to carry {7} name with dignity.</p>\
  <p>{2} had done everything right. Until {3} hadn''t.</p>\
  <p>Now, disgrace clung to {5} like soot. And with it, the memory of her voice - </p>\
  <p>"Your duty is your spine, {1}. Your name is your shadow. Never let them break."</p>\
  <p>{2} wondered what she would say when she heard. Would she bow her head in mourning? Would she curse {7} \
  cowardice? Would she cry - </p>\
  <p>Or worse - would she stay silent?</p>\
  <p>{2} swallowed hard, eyes still fixed on the blade. {6} breath steady, but thinner now.</p>\
  <p>"I''m sorry, Mother," {3} whispered. "I failed them. I failed you. This is all I have left to give.</p>\
  <p>Would she understand that this wasn''t weakness, but the last strength {3} had left? Would she know that this \
  wasn''t surrender - but restoration?</p>\
  <p>Or would she only see a broken child kneeling in the dark?</p>\
  <p>{2} bowed low, placing both hands on the floor before {5}. The incense had nearly burned out. The chamber filled \
  with its final breath of smoke.</p>\
  <p>"Let the name remain," {3} murmured. "Even if the child does not."</p>\
  <p>Behind the partition, {10} stepped forward silently. The moment approached.</p>\
  <p>Later a message would be sent. Formally. With the correct seals. Measured words. Military tone.</p>\
  <p>But nowhere in it would be written the truth {1} feared most:</p>\
  <p>That {7} mother might never forgive {5}.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.3=The room was hushed. Incense curled in the stale air, rising slowly into the \
  dim light. Before <b>{0}</b>, the blade lay perfectly aligned, polished to a mirror edge. It waited.\
  <p>So did <b>{9}</b>, just beyond the partition. Sword drawn. Duty bound.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> sat still, eyes half-lidded, breath measured. {6} thoughts did not race. They moved slow and \
  careful, like brushstrokes. Counting syllables.</p>\
  <p>{2} sought the shape of a final haiku - not to be written down, only held in {7} mind, like a mantra. Like a stone \
  gripped before stepping into a river.</p>\
  <p>{6} lips moved silently. Testing the rhythm.</p>\
  <p>First five.</p>\
  <p><i>Stalwart hearts march on - </i></p>\
  <p>Then seven.</p>\
  <p><i>This body wore their colors,</i></p>\
  <p>And five again.</p>\
  <p><i>But not their spirit.</i></p>\
  <p>{2} closed {7} eyes. The lines were not perfect, but they were honest. There was no need for revision. No more \
  time. Only breath. And silence.</p>\
  <p>{2} inhaled slowly. The incense had almost burned itself out.</p>\
  <p>"Let this be enough," {3} whispered. "Let it mean something."</p>\
  <p>{2} leaned forward. {6} fingers brushed the handle of the blade. Warm. Real. Waiting.</p>\
  <p>From beyond the panel, <b>{9}</b> took one silent step forward.</p>\
  <p>Seventeen syllables.</p>\
  <p>One final truth, balanced and whole, just before the cut.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.4=The chamber was still. Thick with incense and heavy silence. The blade rested\
  \ on a folded cloth before <b>{0}</b> - gleaming, ceremonial, final.\
  <p>{2} knelt in position, posture trained, hands resting lightly on {7} thighs. {2} had rehearsed this. Lived with it. \
  Breathed it.</p>\
  <p>But now, with the act so close - {3} could feel it creeping in through {7} bones - fear.</p>\
  <p>Outside the partition, <b>{9}</b> stood as <i>Kaishakunin</i>. Ready. Trusted. Waiting for the sign.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s breath trembled. {2} pressed {7} palms flat, then lifted them again. Subtle. Almost nothing. But it was \
  enough to betray the storm churning beneath the stillness.</p>\
  <p>{6} eyes flicked to the blade again. That edge. That weight. That promise.</p>\
  <p>"I don''t want to die," {3} whispered, ashamed even as the words left {5}. "I thought I did. I thought I was \
  ready."</p>\
  <p>The chamber didn''t answer. Only the slow drift of incense, curling like hesitation.</p>\
  <p>{2} imagined lifting the blade, setting it to {7} stomach, pressing in. {2} imagined the pain. The panic. The \
  body''s instinct to recoil. To survive. What if {3} froze? What if {7} hand slipped? What if {10} hesitated - </p>\
  <p>"If I fail now..."</p>\
  <p>{2} swallowed, throat dry. Shame burned hotter than fear now. <b>{18}</b> were disgraced - but still alive. \
  Still watching. If {3} botched this, if {3} turned a solemn rite into a desperate gasp, {3} would not just fail \
  {5}{8, choice, 0#self|1#selves}. {2} would shame them all. Forever.</p>\
  <p>{6} fingers twitched. {2} drew a breath, shaky, shallow.</p>\
  <p>"Please," {3} thought, not sure if {3} meant the Combine, the dead, or {10}. "Don''t let me fail them again."</p>\
  <p>{2} reached forward slowly. Touched the blade. Cold steel. Real.</p>\
  <p>{2} forced {7} hands to still. Forced {7} breath to settle. {2} could feel {7} heart pounding, fast and loud in \
  {7} ears. But {3} did not pull away.</p>\
  <p>Outside the partition, {10} took a quiet step forward. Not rushed. Not delayed. Just present. Just ready.</p>\
  <p>{1} did not feel brave. But maybe - just maybe - that was what made this matter.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.5=The room held its breath.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> knelt with the blade in {7} hands. The incense had burned low. The walls were silent. Outside the \
  partition, <b>{9}</b> waited - katana drawn, eyes closed, breath even.</p>\
  <p>{1} bowed once, slow and deep, then straightened. {6} hands found the hilt. {6} knees were steady. {6} palms \
  were slick.</p>\
  <p>{2} drew the blade up before {5}. Its weight was greater than {3} remembered. Or perhaps {7} arms were simply \
  heavier now - filled with doubt, with fear, with memory.</p>\
  <p>{2} looked down. The spot just below {7} ribs. {2} had practiced the cut in theory. Left to right. Clean. \
  Deliberate.</p>\
  <p>{2} pressed the point against {7} abdomen.</p>\
  <p>Cold.</p>\
  <p>{2} paused.</p>\
  <p>And then - </p>\
  <p>{2} drove it in.</p>\
  <p>Pain. Immediate. Blinding. A flash of white-hot agony that stole the breath from {7} lungs. {6} mouth opened, \
  but no sound came.</p>\
  <p>The metal tore through flesh. Muscles resisted. {6} body screamed to stop.</p>\
  <p>{2} pulled the blade across, just as {3} {8, choice, 0#was|1#were} taught. Left to right. Precision dissolved into desperation. {6} arms\
  \ shook. {2} could feel the blood spilling down {7} lap, hot and fast. {6} vision blurred.</p>\
  <p>"Don''t stop," {3} thought. "Don''t stop now."</p>\
  <p>The pain surged. A scream caught in {7} throat. {6} body twisted on instinct. {6} stomach convulsed. The blade \
  slipped in {7} grip, smeared with blood and failure.</p>\
  <p>{2} was dying. Fast. Not clean. Not controlled. {2} couldn''t breathe.</p>\
  <p>But {3} held on. Just long enough. Long enough to mean it. Long enough for the act to be real.</p>\
  <p>{2} opened {7} mouth - maybe to speak a name, maybe to beg forgiveness - but no words came.</p>\
  <p>Then - </p>\
  <p>A flash of movement. A blur of steel.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b>. Perfect. Silent. Merciful.</p>\
  <p>The blade swept clean through the air.</p>\
  <p>And <b>{0}</b> - </p>\
  <p> - was still.</p>\
  <p>Silence reclaimed the chamber.</p>\
  <p>Blood stained the mat. The cloth. The blade. The name.</p>\
  <p>But the act was done.</p>\
  <p>And honor was preserved.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.6=The incense was nearly gone. Only a thin ribbon of smoke remained, twisting \
  toward the ceiling like a spirit already in flight.\
  <p><b>{9}</b> stood behind the partition - silent, katana in hand. {15} boots rested square on the floor, \
  shoulder-width apart. {15} grip was firm but relaxed. {11} had practiced this position in drills. In simulations. \
  Always sterile. Always hypothetical.</p>\
  <p>This was not hypothetical.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> knelt a few paces away, perfectly framed in the opening of the partition. {2} had bowed. Spoken \
  nothing. The silence between them said more than any ritual phrase ever could.</p>\
  <p>{10} watched {5} lift the blade. The short, curved tanto gleamed in the low light - ceremonial, but sharp. Honed \
  for one purpose.</p>\
  <p>{11} saw the {22} hesitate. Just a flicker. A pause of breath.</p>\
  <p>Then - </p>\
  <p>Steel pierced flesh.</p>\
  <p>{10} did not flinch. {11} had trained for this. {11} had told {5}{8, choice, 0#self|1#selves} this moment would come. That this was what it \
  meant to be <i>Kaishakunin</i>. To be chosen. To serve.</p>\
  <p>But none of that training prepared {14} for the sound - </p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> exhaled a guttural noise. Half-growl. Half-cry. The blade moved. Slowly. Shakily. Blood poured \
  across {7} lap, soaking the mat. {6} shoulders tensed. {6} back arched in agony.</p>\
  <p>It was not clean. It was not fast. It was real.</p>\
  <p>{10}''s knuckles whitened on the katana hilt.</p>\
  <p>"{2}''s doing it," {10} thought. "{2}''s carrying the shame. {2}''s giving us a future."</p>\
  <p>Time folded. Everything narrowed. Just the sound of ragged breathing. The scent of blood and incense. The soft \
  scrape of steel dragging through muscle.</p>\
  <p>{1} faltered. {6} head dipped. {6} hands trembled.</p>\
  <p>That was the moment.</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped forward once, smooth and practiced. No noise. No hesitation.</p>\
  <p>The katana arced in a clean, horizontal strike. A single, perfect motion.</p>\
  <p>{1}''s head dipped forward, then stilled completely. {6} body slumped gently, as if falling asleep.</p>\
  <p>{10} lowered the blade. {15} breath stayed even. That, too, was expected.</p>\
  <p>But {16} heart beat like a war drum beneath {16} ribs.</p>\
  <p>{11} looked down at the {22} who had once given {14} orders. Who had once carried the weight of a hundred lives \
  on {7} back. Who had now given everything to redeem the name of <b>{18}</b>.</p>\
  <p>"You didn''t fail us," {10} said quietly. "You saved us."</p>\
  <p>Outside the room, the Combine marched on.</p>\
  <p>But inside, one warrior stood over another - and the line between duty and grief had never felt thinner.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.7=The chamber was still.\
  <p><b>{0}</b> knelt alone on the mat, the blade before {5}, incense trailing ghost-like threads toward the \
  ceiling. Behind the partition, <b>{9}</b> waited - silent, katana drawn, eyes on the {22} {12} had followed \
  into fire and failure.</p>\
  <p>There had been no ceremony, no recitation. Just the shared knowledge that this was how disgrace ended. Not with \
  reassignment. Not with protest. With blood and silence.</p>\
  <p>{1} placed both hands on the dagger and inhaled deeply.</p>\
  <p>{2} pressed the point to {7} abdomen - and drove it in.</p>\
  <p>The breath left {7} lungs in a ragged gasp. The pain hit like lightning. {2} jerked forward, muscles seizing. But\
  \ {3} didn''t stop. {2} tried to pull the blade across {7} stomach, hands trembling with effort.</p>\
  <p>But the cut was shallow. Sloppy. The angle wrong. {6} hands lost strength too quickly, slick with blood. Panic \
  flickered in {7} eyes.</p>\
  <p>{2} tried again, with a cry this time. Not of defiance - but desperation.</p>\
  <p>{6} body twisted, knees slipping on the mat. The blade clattered from {7} hands, blood pooling under {5} in \
  thick rivulets. The chamber echoed with the sound.</p>\
  <p>{10} stepped forward, jaw clenched. This wasn''t how it was supposed to go. This wasn''t the ritual. This was \
  dying badly - without grace, without dignity.</p>\
  <p><b>{0}</b> looked up, eyes wide and unfocused. {6} mouth opened like {3} meant to speak, but no words \
  came - only a gurgle of air and blood.</p>\
  <p>{10} brought the blade down.</p>\
  <p>The strike was clean. It had to be. That much {12} could still give {5}.</p>\
  <p>When the body settled, the silence returned - but it was no longer solemn. It was hollow.</p>\
  <p>There would be reports. Of course there would.</p>\
  <p>But none would say the truth:</p>\
  <p>That <b>{18}</b>'' commander had failed {7} last duty.</p>\
  <p>And that the stain of it would linger - not just on {7} name, but on theirs.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.8=The chamber was quiet but not cold. Smoke from the incense curled in thin \
  lines toward the ceiling, tracing invisible paths like spirits leaving flesh. <b>{0}</b> knelt with the tanto \
  in {7} hands, {7} posture flawless, {7} breath even - for now.\
  <p>Behind the partition, <b>{9}</b> stood ready. The katana rested across {16} palms, then shifted to a firm \
  grip. {15} stance was rigid. {15} heart was not.</p>\
  <p>{1} bowed once. Then again, deeper. And then {3} moved.</p>\
  <p>The blade slid into {7} stomach. The pain came instantly - burning, ripping, real. {2} clenched {7} jaw but did not\
  \ scream. {6} hands trembled as {3} drew the cut, shallow and to the side, but {3} did not stop. {2} would not stop.</p>\
  <p>Blood spilled across the mat. {6} body shook.</p>\
  <p>And then, the pain shifted - became distant. Like echoes behind a closed door.</p>\
  <p>{1} was somewhere else.</p>\
  <p>A garden. Not grand. Not remembered often - until now. {2} had seen it once, as a child, through a slatted fence \
  while waiting outside a temple with {7} mother. The ground had been covered in pale pink petals, drifting from a \
  single cherry tree. The blossoms had fallen like snow, soft and silent.</p>\
  <p>"I thought I''d forgotten," {3} thought, {7} vision blurring. "But it stayed with me."</p>\
  <p>In {7} mind, {3} stood beneath that tree, looking up into the bloom. A petal brushed {7} cheek and melted into \
  the air.</p>\
  <p>"This is what I wanted," {3} thought. "Not glory. Just this."</p>\
  <p>{6} grip on the dagger loosened. {6} arms dropped. {2} was no longer in the chamber. {2} was in the garden. The \
  wind carried the blossoms gently, and {3} breathed it in. Peace. Regret. Release.</p>\
  <p><b>{9}</b> stepped forward. The katana rose in a perfect arc.</p>\
  <p>When it fell, it was with grace - swift, merciful. The act completed.</p>\
  <p>In death, there was stillness. A silence untouched by disgrace.</p>\
  <p>And somewhere - perhaps only in the fading mind of a warrior - cherry blossoms fell forever.</p>
FactionJudgmentSceneDialog.SEPPUKU.DC.9=The lights in the quarters were dimmed. Not out of tradition, but necessity. \
  The room was stripped of all but the essentials. Uniforms gone. Decorations removed. Only the smell of incense and \
  gun oil remained.</p>\
  <p>And the portrait.</p>\
  <p>It hung on the far wall. The Coordinator. Eyes fixed, posture regal, every line of their face carved in loyal \
  silence. They watched from above. Silent judgment - or silent approval. <b>{0}</b> didn''t know anymore. Maybe never \
  did.</p>\
  <p>{1} knelt in the center of the room. Alone. There was no <i>Kaishakunin</i>. No witness. No command staff. Just \
  the steel. Just {5}. Just the Dragon.</p>\
  <p>{2} had not asked for a second. {2} would not shame another by involving them in {7} failure. {2} had already taken \
  <b>{18}</b> into disgrace. {2} would not take anyone else with {5}. This was {7} burden. {6} duty. {6} end.</p>\
  <p>The blade before {5} was clean, polished, wrapped in a folded cloth. {2} had taken {7} time preparing it. Slower \
  than {3} should have. Delay disguised as reverence. {2} could admit that now.</p>\
  <p>{2} looked up once - at the portrait. At those cold, unwavering eyes.</p>\
  <p>"You gave me command," {3} said softly. "I gave you failure."</p>\
  <p>Then {3} looked down. And reached for the blade.</p>\
  <p>It was heavier than it looked. Or perhaps {3} was already weakening, already fading beneath the weight of what \
  was about to come.</p>\
  <p>{2} placed the tip against {7} stomach. Drew a breath. Then another.</p>\
  <p>{2} moved.</p>\
  <p>The blade cut. Flesh parted. Pain erupted. White-hot and immediate. {2} stifled a cry but could not stop the \
  ragged sound from tearing through {7} throat. {6} hands trembled, but {3} dragged the blade across anyway. Too \
  shallow. Too slow. The agony bloomed and pulsed. {2} could feel {7} insides tear. {6} body convulsed, and {7} knees \
  shifted on the floor.</p>\
  <p>{2} tried to steady {7} breathing. Blood poured down {7} thighs. The steel slipped in {7} hand, slick with {7} \
  own failure.</p>\
  <p>There would be no final stroke to spare {5}. No clean death. No mercy.</p>\
  <p>{2} looked up again - at the Coordinator. At the Dragon.</p>\
  <p>"Let this be enough," {3} choked out. "Please... let this be enough."</p>\
  <p>Then {7} body gave out. {2} toppled forward onto the mat, the blade clattering beside {5}. {6} blood pooled \
  beneath {5}, soaking the cloth. The air was thick with the scent of iron and ash.</p>\
  <p>The portrait stared on. Unmoved.</p>\
  <p>In the end, it was not the sword that bore witness. Not the uniform. Not <b>{18}</b>. Not even <b>{0}</b>.</p>\
  <p>Only the Dragon.</p>
