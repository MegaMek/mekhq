    desc: Galatea is an arid planet located just three jumps from Terra. It served
      as a major training location for the Star League Defense force and transitioned
      into the Mercenary Star after the League collapsed after the Amaris Coup. The
      planet fell out of prominence with the rise of the Hiring Hall on Outreach,
      but returned to some of its former glory during and after the Jihad due to the
      destruction of the facilities on Outreach. The primary spaceport, Galaport,
      is located just northwest of the planet's capital Galatean City.
