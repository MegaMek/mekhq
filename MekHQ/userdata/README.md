# User Data Folder
Written 23-APR-2021
MekHQ version 0.49.0

This is a list of all supported files in the userdata directory. Any file not listed here has not been checked to ensure it works properly, and thus the userdata folder is not supported for them. Directories are especially likely to not work if you place them here.

## General Suite Directories/Files:

## MegaMek-specific Folders/Files:

## MegaMekLab-specific Directories/Files:

## MekHQ-specific Directories/Files:
### data/universe Directory
ranks.xml: This contains custom rank files. This is merge implemented, so that is will be merged with the default rank systems in MekHQ on load.
