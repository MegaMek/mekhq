/**
 * Utility class for managing resupply operations and events in MekHQ campaigns.
 *
 * <p>The functionalities provided by this class assist in handling various resupply and convoy-related
 * scenarios, including:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Managing abandoned convoy scenarios by removing units, updating crew statuses, and triggering dialogs.</li>
 *     <li>Estimating cargo requirements for resupply missions based on campaign context and contract details.</li>
 *     <li>Determining the outcomes for personnel (e.g., prisoners of war, killed in action) following combat-related events.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The class interacts heavily with the campaign's {@link Campaign} context and dynamic scenarios
 * from AtB (Against the Bot) contracts. It also integrates random computations for decision-making,
 * ensuring variability in outcomes for immersive campaign simulation.</p>
 *
 * <p>This utility is central to the logistics and event-handling systems present in MekHQ's resupply mechanics.</p>
