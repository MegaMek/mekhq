     * Initializes the minimal set of subsystems required to create a {@link Campaign} object for use in unit testing.
     *
     * <p>This includes loading system data, initializing equipment types, and setting up rank systems. If {@code
     * shouldInitializeSkillTypes} is {@code true}, skill types are also initialized, which is necessary for random
     * personnel generation when using the {@link Campaign#newPerson(PersonnelRole)} family of methods.</p>
     *
     * <p>If personnel objects are being created via {@link Person#Person(Campaign)}, skill type initialization may
     * not be required, and this parameter can be set to {@code false}.</p>
     *
     * <p><b>Usage:</b> this method should be used judiciously and only once per battery of tests. Generally
     * speaking, creating {@link Campaign} objects is expensive and not suitable for every test battery. Instead,
     * consider breaking the dependency on {@link Campaign} in the method you're trying to test. This can be done by
     * only passing in the values essential to the method (or class's) function, rather than the entire {@link Campaign}
     * object. If this cannot be done, then create a single {@link Campaign} object for the whole test class (via this
     * method) and then modify that single object to meet your needs. This will help ensure test time doesn't balloon
     * unnecessarily.</p>

     *                                   generation; {@code false} otherwise. This can generally be left {@code false}
     *                                   unless using the {@link Campaign#newPerson(PersonnelRole)} methods.
