The class address of parts is stored in the campaign save. That means you cannot reorganize the classes in the parts
directory without breaking the save. To account for this, please see Part#fixForRenamedClasses. There you can update
the class references. Once a campaign is loaded, the fixForRenamedClasses method will be called automatically, rectifying
the issue. - Illiani, Sep 21 2025
