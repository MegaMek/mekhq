/**
 * Handles Bloodmark-related logic for characters, including assassination attempt scheduling and execution.
 *
 * <p>A Bloodmark in MekHQ represents a standing bounty or vendetta against a person, triggering periodic
 * assassination attempts ("bloodhunts") against them based on their {@link BloodmarkLevel}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class provides static utility methods to:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Generate future dates for possible bloodhunts depending on bloodmark severity</li>
 *     <li>Check whether an attempt should occur on a given date and whether the target is eligible</li>
 *     <li>Execute an assassination attempt: calculating results, inflicting wounds or injuries, and updating reports
 *     and character status accordingly</li>
 *     <li>Handle special modifiers like the Toughness or Glass Jaw traits, advanced vs. basic medical handling, and
 *     generate appropriately formatted feedback for the campaign event log</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The class also encapsulates internal utility logic for wounds calculation, bounty hunter name generation, and
 * formatting of result reports.</p>
