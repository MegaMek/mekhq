 *     <li>Filtering and sorting Admin/Transport personnel by their skill levels.</li>
 *     <li>Negotiating support points for either a single contract (initial negotiation) or all
 *     active contracts (monthly negotiation).</li>
 *     <li>Calculating support points based on dice rolls and personnel skill levels.</li>
 *     <li>Generating appropriate campaign reports reflecting the success or failure of negotiations.</li>
