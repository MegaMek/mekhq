/**
 * Provides an ITechnology interface for every MekSummary, optionally customized
 * for a particular
 * faction. This requires loading each Entity and calculating the
 * CompositeTechLevel. It usually
 * runs once when the campaign is loaded after the faction is set but also needs
 * to run if date from
 * another faction is needed. This is usually a result of changing the faction
 * or changing the option
 * to use faction-specific tech, but the data can be calculated for multiple
 * factions and used, for example,
 * for a tracked OpFor. The calculation is performed on a separate thread and
 * only blocks if the data is
 * needed before the task completes. There is also a non-blocking call.
