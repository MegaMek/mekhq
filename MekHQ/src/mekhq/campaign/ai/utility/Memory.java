/**
 * Memory class to store data for state processing and decision-making.
 * The memory class is not much dissimilar from the "Options" that many objects have, the difference is that the memory is supposed to be
 * volatile, it is not saved anywhere, it is just a temporary storage for the AI to use during the execution of the AI.
 * The memory will usually keep tabs on "things" that happened, so you can iteratively build on top of what happened in the past to
 * determine future events. One example would be to keep track of the last target that was attacked, so you can avoid attacking the same
 * twice in a roll, or maybe you have a penalty if you were shot at last turn by a specific weapon or in a specific place, this avoids
 * having to keep track of all this information in the object itself, adding an indefinite amount of flags and toggles, and instead
 * allowing for arbitrary information to be stored "on the fly" and used as needed. And of course, to be forgotten when done with.
 * To push anything into memory all you have to do is get a reference to the memory and put the information in it, either with "put" or
 * with computeIfAbsent, which will only put the information if it is not already there, and also good if you want to put a default value
 * such as a list or a map.
 * Every memory has to have a key, which is a string that identifies the memory, and a value, which can be any object, but it is recommended
 * to use the same type of object for the same key, as the memory does not enforce any type of type safety, and you will have to remember
 * the type of the object you put in the memory when you get it back, otherwise you may get a ClassCastException if you try to do it by
 * hand, or an optional empty if you use the "get" method with the wrong type.
 * The use of the memory is reasonably safe, you should not find issues with nullpointers, as the memory will return an empty optional if
 * the key is not found, and you can check if the key is present with "containsKey". Requesting for a specific return type will also return
 * an empty optional if the key is found but the type is not the one you requested, which hardens even more the feature against clerical
 * mistakes.
