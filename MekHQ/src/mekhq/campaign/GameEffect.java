 * A game effect consists for two parts: A (human-readable) description of what it does, and a
 * function (consumer) to be called when it should do it. The function expects a pseudo-random integer

 * <p>
 * Effects are transient structures, used to implement effect generation at a different spot than
 * effect application as well as implementing player choice with useful information about what
 * effect the choice will potentially have.
