/**
 * Handles the optimization of doctor-to-patient assignments.
 *
 * <p>The {@code OptimizeInfirmaryAssignments} class is responsible for efficiently assigning doctors to patients
 * based on the severity of patients' injuries and the experience level of doctors. The assignment process takes into
 * account the maximum number of patients a doctor can handle, as well as the prisoner status of the patient.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key features of this class include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Sorting doctors by their experience level to ensure the most skilled doctors are utilized first.</li>
 *   <li>Sorting patients by the severity of their medical needs, prioritizing critically injured individuals
 *       and deprioritizing prisoners.</li>
 *   <li>Assigning doctors to patients based on the sorted lists, ensuring capacity limits are adhered to
 *       while maintaining an efficient assignment strategy.</li>
 *   <li>Generating medical assignment events for doctor-patient pairings, which can be tracked throughout
 *       the campaign for monitoring and reporting purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to be instantiated with a {@link Campaign} object, after which it automatically
 * organizes doctors, sorts patients by priority, and assigns them according to the specified constraints.</p>
 *
 * @see Campaign Represents the campaign containing doctors, patients, and configuration details.
 * @see Person Represents an individual in the campaign, such as a doctor or patient.
