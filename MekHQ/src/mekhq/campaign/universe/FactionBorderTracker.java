/**
 * Checks all planets within a given region of space and can report which factions control one or more
 * planets in the region, which planets they control, and which foreign-controlled planets are within a
 * certain distance of a friendly planet. For improved performance the region is defined as a hexagon
 * rather than a circle, with the radius being the distance from the center to each vertex.
 *
 * Recalculates in the background whenever the date or the bound of the region to examine change. By
 * default queries made while the background thread is working will block until it finishes, but thresholds
 * can be set for a number of days or a distance, any query made while a change falls under that threshold
 * will use the partially updated data.
 *
 * Changes in campaign date or location will update automatically on each new campaign day if the instance
 * is registered with the event bus.
