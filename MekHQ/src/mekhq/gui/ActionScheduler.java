/**
 * Schedules a future execution of a method after a specified delay. Additional schedulings reset
 * the timer. This is designed for cases when an action produces multiple events that would cause
 * part of the gui to refresh. As long as the events are received within the delay period, only the
 * final one will cause a refresh. This also causes the refresh to occur on the Swing event dispatching
 * thread regardless of which thread it is scheduled from.
