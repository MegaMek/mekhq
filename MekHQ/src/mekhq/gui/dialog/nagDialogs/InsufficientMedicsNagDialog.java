 * A dialog used to notify the user about insufficient medics required to meet the medical needs of the campaign.

 * This nag dialog is triggered when the count of available medics in the campaign falls short of

 *   <li>Displays a dialog to warn the user if the required number of medics exceeds the available count.</li>
