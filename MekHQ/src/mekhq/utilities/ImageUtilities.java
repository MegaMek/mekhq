     * Scales an {@link ImageIcon} to the specified width while maintaining its aspect ratio.
     * The method dynamically determines the scaled height proportional to the original
     * image dimensions to retain visual quality and appearance.
     *
     * <p>The scaling process follows these steps:</p>
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Adjusts the provided {@code width} to account for GUI scaling factors
     *         by using {@link UIUtil#scaleForGUI(int)} to ensure consistent dimensions.</li>
     *     <li>Calculates the new height required to maintain the image's original aspect ratio
     *         using the formula {@code height = (width * originalHeight) / originalWidth}.</li>
     *     <li>Uses {@link Image#getScaledInstance(int, int, int)} to create a resized image
     *         with smooth scaling for better visual quality ({@code Image.SCALE_SMOOTH}).</li>
     *     <li>Packages the resulting scaled image into a new {@link ImageIcon} object
     *         and returns it.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>By dynamically scaling both width and height based on the GUI scaling factor,
     * the method ensures that the resized icon adapts seamlessly across high-DPI displays
     * and varying screen resolutions.</p>
     *
     * @param icon  the {@link ImageIcon} to be resized. This represents the source image
     *              that requires scaling.
     * @param width the desired width (in pixels) to scale the {@link ImageIcon} to.
     *              The actual applied value will consider GUI scaling factors to ensure
     *              consistent appearance across different display settings.
     * @return a new {@link ImageIcon} instance representing the scaled image while
     *         preserving the original aspect ratio.
