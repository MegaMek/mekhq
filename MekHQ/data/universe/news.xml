The investigation, which raised no outliers on the first look but on second pass, uncovered a long buried report regarding the <em>Sholagar</em> aerospace fighter, which Kurita Akiro-<em>sama</em> was piloting on that day. In 2989, during the Battle of Severn a lance of <em>Sholagar</em> fighters followed an aerospace unit into atmospheric conditions that interfered with the operational profile of the <em>Sholagar</em>. We have also found additional evidence in the technical reports we have acquired from the Capellan Confederation regarding their <em>Thrush</em> aerospace fighter, which has the same operational profile as our <em>Sholagar</em>.]]></desc>

Moreover, the operational tempo did not let up until half of the general's command was stretched over a salvage-covered wasteland. General Crawford retreated with what is left of his command off world. We at S7NN welcome the Donegal Guards and hope they enjoy the Games while on Solaris 7.]]></desc>

  		<headline>House Davion, Mercenaries Attack New Aragon</headline>
  		<date>3008-03-30</date>
  		<desc><![CDATA[Yesterday ten BattleMech regiments, along with more than twice that in conventional forces, from the Federated Suns attacked the Capellan world of New Aragon. The Capellan Confederation Armed Forces, long expecting the attack, had already gathered eight BattleMech regiments to repulse them.

      <p>Half the Suns forces are the elite and mysterious Wolf's Dragoons mercenaries who have made such a name for themselves along the Capellan border for the last several years. The Dragoons, who have founded what seems a feud with the Capellan-employed mercenaries known as McCarron's Armored Cavarly, are heavily involved in the initial attacks.</p>

      <p>Speaking from New Avalon, First Prince Ian Davion cheered the no-doubt coordinated assault, calling New Aragon "the crown jewel of the Sarna Commonality" and a keystone in the Capellan defense strategy.</p>

      Capellan military spokespersons have refused comment, but the fact that our Blessed Order's representatives were able to speak to Crucis Lancer officers on-planet certainly suggest the Davion landings were successful.</p>]]></desc>

  		<headline>Wolf's Dragoons Vanish</headline>
  		<date>3009-01-11</date>
  		<desc><![CDATA[AFFS spokespeople confirmed today that the bulk of Wolf's Dragoons has left the New Valencia system, but would not confirm or deny they knew the mercenaries' destination. The few Dragoons left on-planet also refused to comment on their comrades' intentions, only saying it was an approved movement order.
      <p>It is not unusual for almost all of the Dragoons to be off of New Valencia. Just last year before the spectacular assault on New Aragon almost all the combat elements left. But what is unusual this time is that almost the enture support apparatus the insular Dragoons have maintained is gone with them this time. The streets and halls of Fort Jaime are deserted.</p>
      <p>Federated Suns News Service spole with one AFFS officer, who refused to be identified, who claims the Dragoons are off on a long strike against another powerful Capellan target, perhaps Sarna itself, or even Sian. Our military consultants say that is unlikely, given the mauling the Dragoons suffered on New Aragon, but possible.</p>
      <p>A more likely scenario is simple: wherever the Dragoons first got their windfall of 'Mechs, tanks and more, they didn't use it all. And they've gone back for more.</p>
      <p>That's an idea this reporter can't wait to see played out.</p>]]></desc>

		<headline>Hendrik Grimm III Founds Oberon Confederation</headline>
		<date>3012-06-05</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[In a surprising turn of events, self-styled King, Hendrik Grimm III has declared the founding of the Oberon Confederation, with a power base consisting of his large pirate band that has existed since at least 2855 when his grandfather, Hendrik Grimm, deserted from the LCAF along with many of the soldiers that served under him. The unit turned to piracy and made Oberon VI their base of operations and they have been plaguing surrounding system for more than a century.

<p>Oberon VI was once a jewel of the Rim Worlds Republic in the days of the Star League but never recovered from the ravages of the Amaris Coup. A century after the fall of the Star League the planet made for an easy target for the original Hendrik Grimm and a pirate's haven was founded and slavery became rampant.</p>

<p>King Grimm III has promised social and political reform and a change to his ways, including using his men and 'Mechs to defend his new Confederation and to take on legitimate mercenary work for units that can be spared. What will actually become of the new nation remains to be seen. When asked for comment Lyran officials refused to make any public comments, though a few annonymously condemned Hendrik Grimm III and his "pirate nation".</p>]]></desc>

		<date>3013-10-22</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[The Federated Suns is in mourning today with the arrival of news that First Prince Ian Davion was killed yesterday while fighting on Mallory's World. Davion forces, led by General Eugene Drivers and his 17th Avalon Hussars and the local militia held off the larger Combine forces consisting of the elite 2nd Sword of Light and the 24th Dieron Regulars for 11 days before First Prince Ian Davion arrived with the 4th Davion Guards.

<p>Within a week of landing on Mallory's World, the First Prince and the 4th Guards broke the Combine's siege of Colterville, where they had the Hussars pinned. The First Prince then pushed the Davion Guards to break the 2nd Sword of Light, ordering the Hussars to guard his flank and keep the 24th at bay. Unfortunately, disaster struck with the 17th attempted an orbital drop, a specialty of the unit, on the numerical superior 24th Dieron Regulars and the 17th Hussars were crushed. The survivors fled back to Colterville and the 4th Davion Guard's flank was left unprotected.</p>

<p>The Guards quickly found themselves surrounded, however the First Prince managed to spend more than a week evading the trap before the Guards were bottlenecked at the Desolation Pass canyons on October 21st and could no longer keep ahead of their pursuers. The fighting was brutal and the 4th Davion Guards were soon forced to pull further into the canyons. First Prince Ian Davion elected to act as rear-guard for his battered soldiers where he ultimately fell in battle.</p>

<p>The Kell Hounds mercenaries, sent to rescue the Prince, made it to Desolation Pass moments too late to save the First Prince but they were able to drive off the 2nd Sword of Light.</p>

<p>As the late First Prince's heir, Hanse Davion was crowned First Prince of the Federated Suns during a hasty ceremony on New Avalon earlier today. The new First Prince named Yvonne Davion as his Champion.</p>]]></desc>

On May 22, Anton Marik, brother to Captain-General Janos Marik and defender of the Free World League's border with the Capellan Confederation, named himself Captain-General and called for the 'loyal sons and daughters of the League' to support him in overthrowing his brother. Pointing out his brother's recent military failures and self-imposed seclusion, Anton Marik maintained that his brother is unfit to rule and must be replaced for the safety of the realm.

<p>Sources indicate that while most of the Protectorate and several minor provinces have thrown in their support with Anton Marik while the Duchy of Graham-Marik and the Duchy of Oriente have publicily declared for Captain-General Janos Marik, most provinces in the Free Worlds League have so far either not made any public declaration or have already come forward and invoked the Home Defense Act while declaring their neutrality in any potential conflicts between the brothers.<p>

Insider reports indicate that forces loyal to Anton Marik, the rebelling brother to Captain-General Janos Marik, have secured some key victories in their fight to overthrow the leader of the League, including the capture of the 'Mech factories on Irian and Emris IV, as well as additional military manufacturing on Bernardo and Asuncion.

    <p>However, Anton's forces have suffered several setbacks and reversals that could put an end to this war soon. So far the biggest setbacks have been political and not on the battlefield.</p>

    <p>While many regions of the Free Worlds League have declared their neutrality in the conflict and have reserved their forces for the defense of their holdings from Liao and Steiner, the Captain-General has secured support of both Sirius and Regulus, two of the most powerful regions of the League. With the new forces they can provide to the Captain-General, even the elite Wolf's Dragoons may not be enough to keep Anton's Rebellion alive.</p>]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[Rumors abound that Anton Marik, rebel brother of Captain-General Janos Marik, has been colluding and working closely with the Capellan Confederation before and during his ongoing revolt. While no hard evidence exists, rumors continue to surface, and the fact that the Wolf's Dragoons left the service of Liao early and without any complaints of contract breaking, suggest that the contract was instead passed to Anton Marik by agreement. How can a man that claims to be fighting for the benefit of the Free Worlds League collude with our enemy?]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The Civil War between Captain Janos Marik and his brother Anton has ended today. Reports are still coming in from New Delos, however, all reports indicate that some major disagreement between Colonel Jamie Wolf and Anton Marik resulted in the deaths of more than two-dozen Dragoons dependents. After which, Colonel Wolf unleashed the full fury of the Dragoons against Anton Marik and his forces on New Delos.

<p>Reports indicate that Anton Marik's palatial fortress and headquarters at Cienfuegos was completely leveled by the enrgaged Dragoons and the “Ducal Guards” and the 18th Marik Militia defending him were reportedly hunted down and destroyed to the last man.</p>

<p>With their leader lost, the already flagging rebel forces are quickly falling to loyalist forces and for the first time in months, the Free Worlds League may be nearing peace.</p>]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The so-called “New Delos Treason Trials” have finally ended, closing the curtain on a dark period in the long history of the Free Worlds League. The trials were ruthless for those that supported the rebel Anton Marik and fought against Captain-General Janos Marik. The majority of Anton's top supporters and senior officials were found guilty and executed, while lesser supporters were exiled to prison planets or sent to hard labor for their treason. Even the nobles of the League were not spared, even the Captain-General Janos Marik's second son, Gerald Marik, was executed for his part in Anton's Revolt.

<p>Beyond the bloody results of the treason trials, the Free Worlds League remains a nation divided. The rebels are gone but distrust remains between loyalists and those that remained neutral after invoking the Home Defense Act and the FWL Parliament remains splits politically, with many members at odds with each other or the Captain-General.</p>]]></desc>

While declaring no hesitation in asserting the primacy of the Commonwealth, Archon Katrina notes the centuries of unrelenting warfare and indicated a desire to find a way for all nations to peacefully coexist. She did, however, halt at reasserting the Archon's traditional insistence on inheritance of the old Star League title First Lord.

    <p>While it is far too soon for the other lords to have responded, experts here at TBC do expect any response.

    <p>The wedding itself was beautiful, everyone agreed. And the reception after had collected more Successor State lords than any even since the fall of the Star League so many centuries ago. But when it came time for the toasts...</p>

    <p>The bride went first, gifting her husband a regiment of 'Mechs. Kind of tacky, some might have said. But in line. What else could a Davion prince want more?</p>

    <p>The entire Inner Sphere found out when Hanse Davion rose to toast his wife. "I give you the Capellan Confederation!" Davion proclaimed.</p>

    <p>People went <em>crazy</em>. Most of us in the press thought that was it, but later in the hotel lobbies and bars we heard the first reports from ComStar: Davion regiments had crossed into the Confederation in overwhelming strength.</p>

    <p>Hanse Davion clearly means to deliver on his promise. Which means, fellow mercenaries, business is about to get <em>good</em>.</p>]]></desc>

    <p>To say the Federated Commonwealth has had a rough year would be a major understatement; following allegations that Archon Prince Victor Ian Steiner-Davion ordered Joshua Marik, heir to the Free Worlds League, replaced with a body double while he was being treated at the New Avalon Institute of Science, the Archon Prince's sister Katrina Steiner-Davion removed the Lyran half of the realm from the long standing alliance two days after the Capellan Confederation and Free Worlds League used the alleged crimes of the Archon Prince as grounds to launch an invasion. On September 16th, the Capellan Confederation and the Free Worlds League launched a massive invasion of our realm, striking planets captured nearly 30 years ago during the 4th Succession War.</p>
    <p>Peace was formally declared between the Federated Commonwealth, Free Worlds League and Capellan Confederation on December 15th, 3057.</p>]]></desc>

		<headline>Inner Sphere In Conflict</headline>
		<date>3058-03-15</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[Low-level conflict abounds across the Inner Sphere. Reports are flooding in from each realm of worlds invaded or unrest; although none of the Successor States are in open warfare, except the Lyran Alliance which has suffered a major Jade Falcon invasion.

<p>The next biggest hotbed by far is the Federated Commonwealth's Sarna March, which is now being called the Chaos March. After the recent Free Worlds League and Capellan Confederation invasion shattered the March's defenses dozens of planets have found themselves with no centralized authority and the result has been chaos. The entire area is experiencing or in fear of riots, pirates, and raids from minor neighbors and superpowers alike. However, several planets have banded together in mutual defense to form several new minor powers, such as the Tall Trees Alliance and the resurrected Sarna Supremacy, which was originally conquered centuries ago by the Confederation. The violence has even grown to include Towne as forces from the Draconis Combine vie for supremacy and endanger the nearly decade long peace that the Federated Commonwealth has enjoyed with its once bitter enemy.</p>

<p>As the March descends into anarchy, even surrounding planets are being swept into the whirlwind. Terra, the birthplace of humanity, is currently the site of a brutal battle between ComStar and the Word of Blake. Details are almost non-existent but INN has learned that ComStar forces on planet are all but defeated and the Word of Blake will soon be returning home.</p>

<p>But by far, the most overt fighting is taking place along the Lyran Alliance border with Clan Jade Falcon. Shortly after we received word that the fighting between Clans Wolf and Jade Falcon had ended, the Jade Falcons began a vicious invasion of the Lyran Alliance; hitting multiple planets and ultimately driving for Coventry, a major manufacturing center for the Alliance. However, the planet is well defended and so far the Falcon's invasion has bogged down after landing on the planet. Reports indicate extensive losses for the Lyran forces initially defending the planet, the arrival of a mercenary coalition, hired by the Alliance and led by the Wolfs Dragoons is all that kept the planet from falling to the Falcons.

		<desc><![CDATA[The Jade Falcon threat has finally been removed from Coventry, thanks to the arrival of a multi-national task force. Months of bitter fighting for the planet ended peacefully when, shortly after the task force landed, the defenders and the Falcons met for peace talks. Due to the show of strength from the multi-national force, the Jade Falcons agreed to leave the system with no further fighting. This puts an end to more than three months of intense-combat for the manufacturing jewel and also brings an end to the massive Jade Falcon invasion. The multi-national coalition, led by First Prince Victor Davion, inspired Archon Katrina Steiner to invite the other nations of the Inner Sphere to a peace conference, scheduled for October 1st, to further peaceful relations between the realms of the Inner Sphere and to counteract the Clan threat that hangs over everyone.]]></desc>

<p>In his infinite wisdom, the Chancellor called an emergency meeting with the Star League council and declared a state of emergency and requested peacekeeping forces from the rest of the Inner Sphere to secure and demilitarize the St. Ives border to prevent any further unsanctioned attacks by the aggressive rebellious nation. The peacekeepers are expected to arrive within the next few weeks and I am sure the people of the Confederation will feel safer knowing the mighty Star League will help ensure our safety from our belligerent neighbors.</p>]]></desc>

		<headline>Clan Smoke Jaguar Defeated</headline>
		<date>3061-02-15</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[Breaking news from Luthien. Star League Defense Force General Victor Ian Steiner-Davion has made his first public appearance in well over a year and announced the end of the Clan threat.
    <p>Reports are only now being made public that Operation Bulldog, the operation to remove the Smoke Jaguars from Inner Sphere space was only the first half of the plan and was completed in a few months in 3059. The rest of the mission, Task Force Serpent, was kept completely classified until now and was a second attack sent directly to the Clan Home-worlds to destroy the Smoke Jaguars in their den. This second prong of the attack was led by Duke Morgan Hasek-Davion and General Ariana Winston, commander of the famed SLDF Eridani Light Horse. Reports indicate that both commanders were killed while on the Jaguar homeworld of Huntress, though their mission was ultimately a success when the forces from Operation Bulldog, following the Smoke Jaguar forces fleeing the Inner Sphere, arrived in Clan Space.</p>

    <p>After the Jaguars were completely destroyed, Victor Steiner-Davion led his coalition forces to the Clan's capital world, Strana Mechty, and waged a trial against the Clans to end their invasion for good. Forces from each realm squared off against Clan forces and were ultimately victorious, defeating the Clans by their own rules. The Inner Sphere can breath a collective sigh of relief to know that the Clans' invasion plans have been ended and we may be able to expect peace along that front for the immediate future.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately for Victor Steiner-Davion, he returns home to find himself an Archon Prince without a realm. Just three months ago his youngest sister Yvonne abdicated her regency to their sister Katrina Steiner-Davion. The relationship between Victor and Katrina has reportedly been strained for years, starting with the revelations that Victor attempted to replace Joshua Marik with a double, leading to Operation Guerrero, which saw Katrina remove the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth out of the alliance and renamed the realm the Lyran Alliance. For now, the future of the ex-Archon-Prince is unknown. Currently, he is still the commander of the Star League Defense Force and the mighty coalition he used to crush the Smoke Jaguars and stop the rest of the Clan juggernaut.</p>]]></desc>

		<date>3068-01-02</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[It seems that for every mercenary command of sterling character (such as Wolf’s Dragoons, the Kell Hounds or the Twelfth Vegan Rangers),
		there is one for whom money is the only thing that matters. The Word of Blake highlighted this with deadly clarity when they bought Waco’s Rangers, Smithson’s
		Chinese Bandits, the Tiger Sharks and the 51st Dark Panzer Jaegers and unleashed them on Harlech. Now to this roll of dishonor must be added the Broadsword Legion.
		<p>Hired by Wolf’s Dragoons in their moment of need, the Legion turned on their employers as the Dragoons battled to defend their homes from the onslaught of the Blakists’ Sixth and Tenth Divisions.</p>
    <p>At the height of this second battle of Outreach, just as it appeared the defenders were gaining the upper hand, the Broadsword Legion launched a
		furious assault on the rear of the Dragoons’ Wolf Spiders Battalion. Pinned between the Legion and the Blakist Diplomacy of Force III-Alpha, the Wolf Spiders (proud holders of the Black Widow Battalion legacy) were almost annihilated before they could rally. That costly act of treachery further weakened the Dragoons. In an apparent effort to finish off the famed mercenaries once and for all, the Blakists reportedly launched devastating strategic attacks against the planet from orbit.</p>
    <p>Across the Inner Sphere, the same question is being asked: Who will next turn their coat? Which mercenary command will turn on its employers and do the evil bidding of the Word of Blake? This fear has already led to tragedy on Epsilon Indi, where the Com Guards Second Division launched an unprovoked attack on the Tooth of Ymir. Reportedly, relations between the Com Guards and the mercenaries had been strained ever since the mercenary unit arrived on-world.</p>
    <p>Faced with overwhelming odds, Colonel Shadwell wisely ordered the battered Tooth to surrender. Following an exhaustive investigation, Precentor Regis Grandi has reluctantly been forced to concede that no tangible proof exists linking the Tooth with the Word of Blake. The Tooth of Ymir, now under the minimum strength stipulated by their contract, is reportedly headed for Arc-Royal to rebuild. In the meantime, many mercenary commanders are left nervously wondering how long it will be before their equally nervous employers turn on them.</p>]]></desc>
