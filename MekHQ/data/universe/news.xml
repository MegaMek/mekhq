Even more surprising was the news that the 'Mech was of a brand new design, dubbed the Merlin by MWBM, it is a sturdy heavy 'Mech that uses parts common throughout the Inner Sphere and Periphery. The news of a new 'Mech has the military community quite excited as this is the first entirely new design in over 100 years. MWBM is reported to already have a line of customers interested in pruchasing the new 'Mechs just as quickly as they can make them.]]></desc>

While there is very little known about the newly reformed regiment, reports indicate the unit is comprised primarily of heavy and assault 'Mechs. While one regiment is unlikely to make an impact on the highly contested border, the addition of a new assault regiment is never welcome news.]]></desc>

The new mercenaries made off with their entire Wing of fighters, support personnel, and even a rare Vengeance class dropship.

The 2nd Winfield Guards were decimated and reports indicate that the unit is completely combat ineffective and survivors will be rolled into the 1st Winfield Guards, which also suffered heavy damage. This battle represents yet another major failure by the Commonwealth's intelligence community for failing to note the relocation of such a large Combine force. If the 1st Guards had not arrived from Laurent when they did it is likely the planet Sevren would now belong to the Combine and all members of the 2nd Guard captured or killed.]]></desc>

This latest promotion is just one of many in Hanse's meteoric rise in power in recent years. He has worked his way from Lance commander in the 3rd Davion Guards to ultimately become the CO of the entire famed regiment barely a year ago and then barely a month ago he was appointed Military Governor of newly liberated New Aragon. The latest promotion for Hanse makes him one of the most powerful men in the Suns and is a show of great faith from his older brother First Prince Ian Davion.]]></desc>

		<headline>Hendrik Grimm III Founds Oberon Confederation</headline>
		<date>3012-06-05</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[In a surprising turn of events, self-styled King, Hendrik Grimm III has declared the founding of the Oberon Confederation. With a power base consisting of his large pirate band that has existed since at least 2855 when his grandfather, Hendrik Grimm, deserted from the LCAF along with many of the soldiers that served under him. The unit turned to piracy and made Oberon VI their base of operations and they have been plaguing surrounding system for more than a century.

Oberon VI was once a jewel of the Rimworld Republic in the days of the Star League but never recovered from the ravages of the Amaris Coup. A century after the fall of the Star League the planet made for an easy target for the original Hendrik Grimm and a pirate's haven was founded and slavery became rampant.

King Grimm III has promised social and political reform and a change to his ways, including using his men and 'Mechs to defend his new Confederation and to take on legitimate mercenary work for units that can be spared. What will actually become of the new nation remains to be seen. When asked for comment Lyran officials refused to make any public comments, though a few annonymously condemned Hendrik Grimm III and his "pirate nation".]]></desc>

Following the death of the Captain-General's second wife, Ana Stewart, and two of their children earlier this year, sources in the Captain-General's offices say that Janos Marik has completely withdrawn from the public eye and sees only a very select few people and otherwise has barely ventured from his personal suite. While various news outlets have noted the lack of public appearances by the Captain-General no one knew just how far withdrawn Janos Marik had become. What will this mean for the League if the Captain-General is absent and can he adequately lead from behind closed doors? We ask our panel of experts.]]></desc>

While the new 'Mech is 33% heavier than the original, the 'Mech has a lot in common with its lighter sire, pairing a PPC and laser in each arm, with a large laser in place of the traditional autoocannon. While the new Marauder II is slower, engineers have compensated by adding jumpjets that allow this 'Mech to jump up to 90 meters at a time. The initial line of Marauder IIs are slated for the Wolf's Dragoons, however Blackwell represntatives stated that they would begin taking orders on a first-come, first-serve basis starting in six-months.]]></desc>

While Capellan officials refuse to comment, stating that they can "never discuss military deployments due to security concerns" rumors abound that the infamous mercenary unit has been deployed to garrison Carver V. If true, it would explain the lack of action from the Dragoons in recent months, though it does not take a military analyst to question why such a powerful unit would be withheld from combat.]]></desc>

		<date>3013-04-12</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[It is with great remorse that I bring you the following report. Herodias Ap Gwynn, the founder of the Pan-Humanist doctrine, was found dead earlier today. Herodias Ap Gwynn was well respected throughout the Alliance as an idealist, pacifist and philosopher, whose idea attracted hundreds if not thousands of followers to his view that humantiy shares a common path and goal. He spent his life as a conciliator, diplomat and techer, instructing his followers to offer aid to those in need and to spread peace, education and medicine throughout the known galaxy. Herodias Ap Gwynn was 60 years old, at this time the cause of death is unknown, though authorities do not suspect foul-play was involved. Ceremonies will be held on Alpheratz in two weeks, with hundreds of Pan Humanists expected to be in attendance. Officials from the organization that Herodias Ap Gwynn began decades ago promised that his works and teachings will continue even after his death.]]></desc>

		<headline>Federated Suns In Mourning</headline>
		<date>3013-10-22</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[The Federated Suns is in mourning today with the arrival of news that First Prince Ian Davion was killed yesterday while fighting on Mallory's World. Davion forces, led by General Eugene Drivers and his 17th Avalon Hussars and the local militia held off the larger Combine forces consisting of the elite 2nd Sword of Light and the 24th Dieron Regulars for 11 days before First Prince Ian Davion arrived with the 4th Davion Guards.

Within a week of landing on Mallory's World, the First Prince and the 4th Guards broke the Combine's siege of Colterville, where they had the Hussars pinned. The First Prince then pushed the Davion Guards to break the 2nd Sword of Light, ordering the Hussars to guard his flank and keep the 24th at bay. Unfortunately, disaster struck with the 17th attempted an orbital drop, a specialty of the unit, on the numerical superior 24th Dieron Regulars and the 17th Hussars were crushed. The survivors fled back to Colterville and the 4th Davion Guard's flank was left unprotected.

The Guards quickly found themselves surrounded, however the First Prince managed to spend more than a week evading the trap before the Guards were bottlenecked at the Desolation Pass canyons on October 21st and could no longer keep ahead of their pursuers. The fighting was brutal and the 4th Davion Guards were soon forced to pull further into the canyons. First Prince Ian Davion elected to act as rear-guard for his battered soldiers where he ultimately fell in battle.

The Kell Hounds mercenaries, sent to rescue the Prince, made it to Desolation Pass moments too late to save the First Prince but they were able to drive off the 2nd Sword of Light.

As the late First Prince's heir, Hanse Davion was crowned First Prince of the Federated Suns during a hasty ceremony on New Avalon earlier today. The new First Prince named Yvonne Davion as his Champion.]]></desc>

In a ceremony honoring his brother, First-Prince Hanse Davion christened the 1st Federated Suns Armored Cavalry.

Without a doubt, the First-Prince is hoping to capture the planet so that this technology can be claimed by the Suns.

News from the planet seems to be cut off, however we have received initial reports from the planet which indicate the fighting is fierce between the Draconis Combine defenders and the Suns invaders.]]></desc>

		<headline>Open Rebellion In The Free Worlds League</headline>
		<date>3014-05-25</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[Today, we received shocking news, out of New Delos. On May 22, Anton Marik, brother to Captain-General Janos Marik and defender of the Free World League's border with the Capellan Confederation, named himself Captain-General and called for the 'loyal sons and daughters of the League' to support him in overthrowing his brother. Pointing out his brother's recent military failures and self imposed seclusion, Anton Marik maintained that his brother is unfit to rule and must be replaced for the safety of the realm.

Sources indicate that while most of the Protectorate and several minor provinces have thrown in their support with Anton Marik while the Duchy of Graham-Marik and the Duchy of Oriente have publicily declared for Captain-General Janos Marik, most provinces in the Free Worlds League have so far either not made any public declaration or have already come forward and invoked the Home Defense Act while declaring their neutrality in any potential conflicts between the brothers.

We will have more as this story develops. Next, our analysts will discuss what Anton Marik's rebellion will mean for citizens across the League. Stay tuned.]]></desc>

We are unaware at this time if Chancelor Liao has loaned the Dragoons to Anton Marik or if they simply broke contract.

Insider reports indicate that forces loyal to Anton Marik, the rebelling brother to Captain-General Janos Marik, have secured some key victories in their fight to overthrow the leader of the League, including the capture of the 'Mech factories on Irian and Emris IV, as well as additional military manufacturing on Bernardo and Asuncion. However, Anton's forces have suffered several setbacks and reversals that could put an end to this war soon. However, so far the biggest setbacks have been political and not on the battlefield. While many regions of the Free Worlds League have declared their neutrality in the conflict and have reserved their forces for the defense of their holdings from Liao and Steiner, the Captain-General has secured support of both Sirian and Regulus, two of the most powerful regions of the League. With the new forces they can provide to the Captain-General, even the elite Wolf's Dragoons may not be enough to keep Anton's Rebellion alive.]]></desc>

After which, Colonel Wolf unleashed the full fury of the Dragoons against Anton Marik and his forces on New Delos.

Reports indicate that Anton Marik's palatial fortress and headquarters at Cienfuegos was completely leveled by the enrgaged Dragoons and the “Ducal Guards” and the 18th Marik Militia defending him were reportedly hunted down and destroyed to the last man.

With their leader lost, the already flagging rebel forces are quickly falling to loyalist forces and for the first time in months, the Free Worlds League may be nearing peace.]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The so-called “New Delos Treason Trials” have finally ended, closing the curtain on a dark period in the long history of the Free Worlds League. The trials were ruthless for those that supported the rebel Anton Marik and fought against Captain-General Janos Marik. The majority of Anton's top supporters and senior officials were found guilty and executed, while lesser supporters were exiled to prison planets or sent to hard labor for their treason. Even the nobles of the League were not spared, even the Captain-General Janos Marik's second son, Gerald Marik, was executed for his part in Anton's Revolt.

Beyond the bloody results of the treason trials, the Free Worlds League remains a nation divided. The rebels are gone but distrust remains between loyalists and those that remained neutral after invoking the Home Defense Act and the FWL Parliament remains splits politically, with many members at odds with each other or the Captain-General.]]></desc>

Several mechwarriors have been arrested and at least four civilian deaths have been reported. Stable owners have been warned that any incident will be met with harsh punishment and that any mechwarriors identified inciting violence outside of the arena will be treated accordingly. As a result of the increasing tension on the Commonwealth/Combine border, arena attendance has been higher than normal and betting has seen a large increasein volume.

The War of 3039 has seen this elite mercenary unit in action once more. Our correspondent, Nathalie Myers, accompanied them to Altais and brings this report. 
				<p>Myers: I’m here on the outskirts of New Ross with Legion officer Davis McCall. Major McCall, can you tell me what happened here?

The new <i>Axman</i> weighs significantly more than its predecessor but is otherwise very similar. Both 'Mechs wield massive hatchets and are armed with large-bore auto-cannons for destroying other 'Mechs and both designs have a top speed of nearly 65 km/h and jump jets. The biggest difference between the <i>Axman</i> and the <i>Hatchetman</i>, other than their size, is the inclusion of rediscovered Lostech on the <i>Axman</i>.]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The Federated Commonwealth unveiled a new construction line at the Norse-Storm manufacturing plant on Loxley today. A news conference held at the plant wowed reports by showing off the impressive <i>Devastator</i> assault 'Mech.

The <i>Devastator</i> is rumored to have been designed by Aleksander Kerensky himself, just prior to the Amaris Coup, which resulted in only a handful of prototypes ever making it off the factory floor before the design was lost to history. The <i>Devastator</i> wasn't rediscovered until forces from the Federated Suns discovered blue prints in an abandoned Star League facility on Hoff in 3023. Unfortunately, the advanced materials and parts required meant that the <i>Devastator</i> would not see production for another two-decades, with full production only beginning earlier this year.]]></desc>

		<headline>Periphery Gone Quiet</headline>
		<date>3049-12-10</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[For almost four months now, the Periphery realms Elysian Fields, the Oberon Confederation, Greater Valkyrate and the Baron of Strang have all been silent. While not overly unusual due to the limited collection of HPG's in that corner of the galaxy and their limited trade with the Inner Sphere, there have been worrying reports along the border of the Federated Commonwealth and Free Rasalhague Republic that there have been refugees fleeing from some unknown attackers. While most news sources are claiming it is nothing more than a new pirate lord or simply a war between the various minor realms, the Observer is not so sure. Having spoken with several refugees, they claim that the attackers were far too organized and were using unrecognizable equipment. What does that leave us? Has the Federated Commonwealth decided it is time to capture the way-ward pirate-realms of their near-Periphery or is this the start of something far more sinister?]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[The Federated Commonwealth breathes a sigh of relief as word spreads that hostilities between our nation and the Free Worlds League and their Capellan Confederation allies have come to an end after several months of brutal fighting. To say the Federated Commonwealth has had a rough year would be a major understatement; following allegations that First-Prince Victor Ian Steiner-Davion ordered Joshua Marik, heir to the Free Worlds League, replaced with a body-double while he was being treated at the New Avalon Institute of Science, the First-Prince's sister Katrina Steiner-Davion removed the Lyran half of the realm from the long standing alliance two days after the Capellan Confederation and Free Worlds League used the alleged crimes of the First-Prince as grounds to launch an invasion. On September 16th, the Capellan Confederation and the Free Worlds League launched a massive invasion of our realm, striking planets captured nearly 30 years ago during the 4th Succession War. Peace was formally declared between the Federated Commonwealth, Free Worlds League and Capellan Confederation on December 15th, 3057.]]></desc>

		<headline>War Between Clans?</headline>
		<date>3058-01-02</date>

As always, news from the conquered territory is scarce at best, however from what we have heard both Clans have been fighting on multiple worlds, though the reasons behind the conflict are at this time unknown. Perhaps this large-scale infighting between the Clan invaders will allow the governments of the Inner Sphere to finally remove the rampaging Clan hordes once and for all.

Once piece of news that we have received from the fighting is that the notorious Black-Widow, Natasha Kerensky, was killed in combat on the planet Twycross. We have received no details of how the fearsome femme fatale died, other than that she “went down in a blaze of glory”. This ends the legend half a century in the making.]]></desc>

		<headline>Inner Sphere In Conflict</headline>
		<date>3058-03-15</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[Low-level conflict abounds across the Inner Sphere. Reports are flooding in from each realm of worlds invaded or unrest; although none of the Successor States are in open warfare, except the Lyran Alliance which has suffered a major Jade Falcon invasion.

The next biggest hotbed by far is the Federated Commonwealth's Sarna March, which is now being called the Chaos March. After the recent Free Worlds League and Capellan Confederation invasion shattered the March's defenses dozens of planets have found themselves with no centralized authority and the result has been chaos. The entire area is experiencing or in fear of riots, pirates, and raids from minor neighbors and superpowers alike. However, several planets have banded together in mutual defense to form several new minor-powers, such as the Tall Trees Alliance and the resurrected Sarna Supremacy, which was originally conquered centuries ago by the Confederation. The violence has even grown to include Towne as forces from the Draconis Combine vie for supremacy and endanger the nearly decade long peace that the Federated Commonwealth has enjoyed with its once bitter enemy. 

As the March descends into anarchy, even surrounding planets are being swept into the whirlwind. Terra, the birthplace of humanity, is currently the sight of a brutal battle between ComStar and the Word of Blake. Details are almost non-existent but INN has learned that ComStar forces on planet are all but defeated and the Word of Blake will soon be returning home.

But by far, the most overt fighting is taking place along the Lyran Alliance border with Clan Jade Falcon. Shortly after we received word that the fighting between Clans Wolf and Jade Falcon had ended, the Jade Falcons began a vicious invasion of the Lyran Alliance; hitting multiple planets and ultimately driving for Coventry, a major manufacturing center for the Alliance. However, the planet is well defended and so far the Falcon's invasion has bogged down after landing on the planet. Reports indicate extensive losses for the Lyran forces initially defending the planet, the arrival of a mercenary coalition, hired by the Alliance and led by the Wolfs Dragoons is all that kept the planet from falling to the Falcons. Will the Alliance lose one of its manufacturing gems or will the Falcons break their beak on the tenacious Inner Sphere defenders?]]></desc>

Months of bitter fighting for the planet ended peacefully when, shortly after the task force landed, the defenders and the Falcons met for peace talks. Due to the show of strength from the multi-national force, the Jade Falcons agreed to leave the system with no further fighting. This puts an end to more than three months of intense-combat for the manufacturing jewel and also brings an end to the massive Jade Falcon invasion. The multi-national coalition, led by First-Prince Victor Davion inspired Archon Katrina Steiner to invite the other nations of the Inner Sphere to a peace conference, scheduled for October 1st, to further peaceful relations between the realms of the Inner Sphere and to counter-act the Clan threat that hangs over everyone.]]></desc>

		<date>3060-08-16</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[We have more good news to report regarding the Lyran Alliance's military academies. A ceremony was just held to christen the re-opening of the Coventry Military Academy. As all of our viewers recall, the Coventry Military Academy was damaged during the Jade Falcons destructive invasion in 3058, which saw the Jade Falcons conquer several worlds before converging on Coventry with several Galaxies of 'Mechs. The Falcons were intent on capturing the planet's vital 'Mech factories and there was fierce fighting by the defending 10th Skye Rangers, Coventry Militia and the Coventry Military Academy Training Cadre. The Academy's buildings and grounds were caught in the middle of one particularly violent battle and the Academy has been rebuilding ever since the Falcons were forced off the planet.]]></desc>

These riots are expected to make a bad situation worse by slowing the shipment of food and other every day essentials. Polls indicate the vast majority of citizens in the Federated Suns feel Yvonne is doing a poor job of running the realm in her brother Victor's absence.]]></desc>

		<headline>Hustaing Attacked, Chancellor Missing</headline>
		<date>3060-10-02</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[CBC has just received news that the Blackwind Lancers, a battalion from the St. Ives Compact, launched a surprise raid on the Confederation planet of Hustaing on September 26. We have very little information to report at this time as the Word of Blake has placed the planet under a temporary blackout and is not sending or receiving any HPG messages for Hustaing. Reports indicate that First Lord of the Star League and Chancellor of the Capellan Confederation, his Celestial Wisdom Sun-Tzu Liao and his fiancé Duchess Isis Marik were scheduled to make an appearance on Hustaing the day of the attack and there have been no sightings of the Chancellor since the attack and no official word from Sian. We here at CBC hope the Celestial Wisdom is safe and this situation will be cleared up shortly.]]></desc>

The conference, attended by Protector Jeffrey Calderon and Magistrix Emma Centralla and representatives of the Capellan Confederation, due to the Chancellors uncertain status after the attack on Hustaing, were planning to discuss a potential alliance between the three realms. Unfortunately, President Sherman Maltin and several of the Colonial Marshals have taken the Protector and Magistrex hostage in a bid for independence for the Concordat's New Colony Region. For now the situation is tense as forces from the Capellan Confederation, Magistracy of Canopus and Taurian Concordat struggle to respond.]]></desc>

		<headline>Clan Ghost Bear Here To Stay</headline>

		<desc><![CDATA[For the first time ever, a Clan Khan, specifically Khan Bjorn Jorgensson of Clan Ghost Bear, invited journalists from across the Inner Sphere to the Ghost Bear Inner Sphere capital Alshain for a press conference. During the conference the Khan announced his Clans intention to become permanent residents of the Inner Sphere and the formation of the “Ghost Bear Dominion”. Stating that the “Clan Crusade” was a failure and the Ghost Bears have decided it is time to “work towards increased cooperation between the warriors of the Clan and the citizens of our new holdings and our neighbors”. It is unclear what the formation of the new Dominion truly means for the people of the Dominion and its neighbors, however the Ghost Bear Khan expressed an interest in making the Dominion more open to the Inner Sphere than in the past, including expanded trade, especially with the nascent Free Rasalhague Republic, which has close ties to the populations on most of the captured Ghost Bear planets.]]></desc>

		<desc><![CDATA[Today, is a day of celebration for people of the Confederation, CBC has finally received word from the planet of Hustaing and along with verification that First Lord of the Star League and our Celestial Wisdom, Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao is safe and never landed on Hustaing. The Blackwind Lancers have been captured and  his Celestial Wisdom's fiance, Duchess Marik, was kept safe from the vile Lancers by the valiant efforts of the Hustaing Militia and Warrior House Hiritsu. The Chancellor has announced the formation of the Hustaing Warriors, a new 'Mech battalion using the 'Mechs captured from the Blackwind Lancers and raised from Hustaing locals.

In his infinite wisdom, the Chancellor called an emergency meeting with the Star League council and declared a state of emergency and requested peace keeping forces from the rest of the Inner Sphere to secure and demilitarize the St. Ives border to prevent any further unsanctioned attacks by the aggressive rebellious nation. The peace-keepers are expected to arrive within the next few weeks and I am sure the people of the Confederation will feel safer knowing the mighty Star League will help ensure our safety from our belligerent neighbors.]]></desc>

Five planets have been targeted for 'demilitarization' including Indicass, Vestallas, Bashuar, Brighton and Denbar. Units from the Free Worlds League, Draconis Combine, Lyran Alliance, Capellan Confederation, Magistracy of Canopus, Taurian Concordat and even our own Federated Commonwealth have made landfall. There has already been one reported incident, resulting from when a battalion of the 2nd St. Ives Lancers on Indicass, unaware of the 'Peace-keepers' intentions, opened fire on the 2nd Oriente Hussars as they unloaded from their Dropships. Reports indicate damage was minimal before the St. Ives forces were ordered to stand down by high command.]]></desc>

		<headline>Archon Katrina Steiner-Davion Named Regent Of Federated Commonwealth</headline>
		<date>3060-12-22</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[In an unexpected, though welcome, move Yvonne Steiner-Davion held a press conference earlier today and announced she abdicated her position as Regent immediately. Citing the realm's recent unrest, poor economy and the growing discontent that have plagued her short reign while her brother Archon-Prince Victor Steiner-Davion is fighting the Clans in Combine space, Yvonne has named her sister, Archon Katrina Steiner-Davion as her replacement Regent for the Federated Commonwealth. Yvonne went on to expand that she had every faith that her older sister Katrina would be able to fix the problems in the Federated Commonwealth and restore the people's faith, pointing out the great success Katrina Steiner-Davion has enjoyed while ruling the Lyran Alliance. After the press conference, reports indicated that the former Regent was leaving New Avalon and was headed for an undisclosed location. Archon-Princess Katrina Steiner-Davion held her own press conference immediately after announcing her acceptance of the new position and the great responsibilities that came with it and she thanked her sister for thinking first of the people of the Federated Commonwealth and wished her brother Victor would have remembered those same responsibilities before abandoning the realm for his crusade against the Clans.]]></desc>

The forces from all member nations of the Star League were put in place at the behest of First Lord Sun-Tzu Liao and most of them made landfall more than a month ago. Since then, the St. Ives Compact has held its breath as the peace-keepers attempted to disarm our border and defenders. There have been several skirmishes already between the peace-keepers and St. Ives forces. Hopefully with the removal of the Star League forces will defuse the situation. The Star League forces are scheduled to leave the Compact on January 27th.]]></desc>

Reports indicate that the Compact has already lost several planets and our defenders struggle to hold back the larger Capellan Confederation. To add additional insult to injury, our 'allies' in the Federated Commonwealth have so far shown no signs of sending additional aid to help defend our realm against the voracious Confederation.]]></desc>

The forces were successful in putting down the revolt and managed to rescue Magistrix Centrella. Unfortunately, both President Maltin and Protector Calderon were killed in the fighting. Already Grover Shraplen has been named the Taurian Concordat's new Protector and reports indicate that the successful joint operation has propelled the 'Trinity-Alliance' talks forward. The Capellan Confederation has agreed to a mutual defense pact and has generously offered to send teachers, engineers and technical staff to the Magistracy and Concordat to bring both realms 'into the 31st century'.]]></desc>

		<headline>Clan Smoke Jaguar Defeated</headline>
		<date>3061-05-15</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[Breaking news from Luthien. Star League Defense Force General, Victor Ian Steiner-Davion has made his first public appearance in well over a year and announced the end of the Clan threat. Reports are only now being made public that Operation Bulldog, the operation to remove the Smoke Jaguars from Inner Sphere space was only the first half of the plan and was completed in a few months in 3059. The rest of the mission, Task Force Serpent, was kept completely classified until now and was a second attack sent directly to the Clan Home-worlds to destroy the Smoke Jaguars in their den. This second prong of the attack was led by Duke Morgan Hasek-Davion and General Ariana Winston, commander of the famed SLDF Eridani Light Horse. Reports indicate that both commanders were killed while on the Jaguar home-world of Huntress, though their mission was ultimately a success when the forces from Operation Bulldog, following the Smoke Jaguar forces fleeing the Inner Sphere, arrived in Clan Space.

After the Jaguars were completely destroyed, Victor Steiner-Davion led his coalition forces to the Clan's capital world, Strana Mechty, and waged a trial against the Clans to end their invasion for good. Forces from each realm squared off against Clan forces and were ultimately victorious, defeating the Clans by their own rules. The Inner Sphere can breath a collective sigh of relief to know that the Clans' invasion plans have been ended and we may be able to expect peace along that front for the immediate future.

Unfortunately for Victor Steiner-Davion, he returns home to find himself an Archon-Prince without a realm. Just three months ago his youngest sister Yvonne abdicated her regency to their sister Katrina Steiner-Davion. The relationship between Victor and Katrina has reportedly been strained for years, starting with the revelations that Victor attempted to replace Joshua Marik with a double, leading to Operation Guerrero, which saw Katrina remove the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth out of the alliance and renamed the realm the Lyran Alliance. For now, the future of the ex-Archon-Prince is unknown. Currently, he is still the commander of the Star League Defense Force and the mighty coalition he used to crush the Smoke Jaguars and stop the rest of the Clan juggernaut.]]></desc>

Early in the Clan Invasion the Steel Vipers shared the Falcons invasion corridor, until inter-clan battling resulted in the Falcons forcibly ejecting the Vipers from their space. While the inter-clan battling is still somewhat of a mystery to the Inner Sphere, we will have to see if the reappearance of the Steel Vipers means they are here to stay this time or not.]]></desc>

		<headline>Mercenary Treachery</headline>
		<date>3068-01-02</date>
		<desc><![CDATA[It seems that for every mercenary command of sterling character (such as Wolf’s Dragoons, the Kell Hounds or the Twelfth Vegan Rangers), 
		there is one for whom money is the only thing that matters. The Word of Blake highlighted this with deadly clarity when they bought Waco’s Rangers, Smithson’s 
		Chinese Bandits, the Tiger Sharks and the 51st Dark Panzer Jaegers and unleashed them on Harlech. Now to this roll of dishonor must be added the Broadsword Legion. 
		Hired by Wolf’s Dragoons in their moment of need, the Legion turned on their employers as the Dragoons battled to defend their homes from the onslaught of the Blakists’ 
		Sixth and Tenth Divisions.<p>At the height of this second battle of Outreach, just as it appeared the defenders were gaining the upper hand, the Broadsword Legion launched a 
		furious assault on the rear of the Dragoons’ Wolf Spiders Battalion. Pinned between the Legion and the Blakist Diplomacy of Force III-Alpha, the Wolf Spiders (proud holders 
		of the Black Widow Battalion legacy) were almost annihilated before they could rally. That costly act of treachery further weakened the Dragoons. In an apparent effort to 
		finish off the famed mercenaries once and for all, the Blakists reportedly launched devastating strategic attacks against the planet from orbit.<p>Across the Inner Sphere, 
		the same question is being asked: Who will next turn their coat? Which mercenary command will turn on its employers and do the evil bidding of the Word of Blake? This 
		fear has already led to tragedy on Epsilon Indi, where the Com Guards Second Division launched an unprovoked attack on the Tooth of Ymir. Reportedly, relations between the 
		Com Guards and the mercenaries had been strained ever since the mercenary unit arrived on-world.<p>Faced with overwhelming odds, Colonel Shadwell wisely ordered the battered 
		Tooth to surrender. Following an exhaustive investigation, Precentor Regis Grandi has reluctantly been forced to concede that no tangible proof exists linking the Tooth with 
		the Word of Blake. The Tooth of Ymir, now under the minimum strength stipulated by their contract, is reportedly headed for Arc-Royal to rebuild. In the meantime, many mercenary 
		commanders are left nervously wondering how long it will be before their equally nervous employers turn on them.]]></desc>
