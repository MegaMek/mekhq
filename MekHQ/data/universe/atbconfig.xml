This file allows users to change the various tables and some universe
details used by the Against the Bot campaign system.

Note that this feature is in development, and more options will be appearing.

Several options make use of a <weightedTable> node, which is used to represent a table
of options chosen by a dice roll. Each entry in the table has the form <entry weight="#">option</entry>.
The value of the weight attribute indicates how likely that option is to be chosen:
a value of 2 is twice as likely to be chosen as a value of 1, but half as likely as a value
of 4. An entry of the form <entry>option</entry> has a weight of 1.

		<!-- Tables for generating the enemy force. <botForce> determines how many lances
		or lance-equivalents are in the enemy force and the weight class of each.
		The org attribute indicates which type of organization the opposing force uses:
		CLAN is used for any Clan faction, CS for ComStar and WoB, and IS for all others.
		If the same set of tables is used for multiple orgs, they are separated by commas.
		There should be a <weightedTable> node for each of the four weight classes: L, M, H, A.
		These correspond to the weight class of the player's lance. See above for the <weightTable>
		format. -->
