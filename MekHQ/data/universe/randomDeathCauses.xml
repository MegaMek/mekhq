Some of these percentages are according to LCWK2, Deaths, percent of total deaths, and death rates for the 15 leading causes of death in 10-year age groups, by race and Hispanic origin, and sex: United States, 2017. This was released by the CDC.
I took the baseline ones and expanded from that to fill the data out.

Any numbers not handled there are based on further data originating from the CDC.
