    desc: Misery is a frigid world near the Federated Suns and Draconis Combine border.
      Misery is an unappealing planet that primarily gets by on limited mining and
      is barely able to produce sufficient food for its population. The planet boasts
      very little industry and technology and relies primarily on imports. Misery
      was made famous in the early 31st Century for the large battle between Wolfâ€™s
      Dragoon and the DCMS Ryuken.
