      New Capetown is a planet with an ugly past. The original colonists were primarily White Supremacists and the laws of the planet created a massive racial divide. These laws stunted the planetâ€™s growth as outsiders to the planet were loathe to deal with New Capetown. It was not until the 3030s that the oppressive regime was toppled and the planet was brought in line with the ideals of the Lyran Commonwealth.

      New Capetown is moderately industrialized and is a comfortable temperate planet with abundant arable land. The planet is also home to the Royal New Capetown Military Academy, which is located in the planetary capital of New Hope on the mild flatlands of Pretoria.
