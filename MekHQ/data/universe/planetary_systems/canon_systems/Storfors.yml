      Storfors is a nearly vital planet to the defense of the Lyran Commonwealth. Storfors III is not the only planet settled in the Storfors system, but it is the most Earth-like of the three inhabited planets. Storfors III has a comfortable atmosphere, gravity and temperate climate. There is also abundant land for agriculture which allows the planet to support not only its population but the other planets inthe system. Additionally, the planet is blessed with abundant resources and receives more from the other inhabited planets. These natural resources are used to feed the large industrial centers on the planet. During the Word of Blake Jihad, Storfors was captured by the Word of Blake and the Blakists converted a smelting plant into a BattleMech factory. The J. B. BattleMechs Inc. facility is located in the town of Bodenboro in the snowy tundra of the Inkalda continent.
