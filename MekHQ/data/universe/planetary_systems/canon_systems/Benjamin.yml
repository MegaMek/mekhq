      Benjamin is a large planet that is barely habitable due to its dim sun. In order to make the planet more liveable early engineers installed twenty ‘mini-suns’ into orbit which act much like jumpship solar sails and help collect and redirect more sunlight at the surface of the planet. Despite the dim sun, Benjamin manages a cool but temperate climate that allows for the the growth of hardier crops and livestock that can survive the colder temperatures. While Benjamin does not possess abundant natural resources it does possess some deposits of petroleum and coal which make up the backbone of the limited industry on planet, which primarily produces parts for wheeled vehicles. While the light industry and modest agriculture concerns do not make Benjamin a standout planet, the fact that the planet is a Military District capital does. The entire Benjamin Military District is run from the sprawling administrative center located in the planetary capital, Deber City.

      During the Word of Blake Jihad, Benjamin was right on the edge of the Word of Blake protectorate but a valiant defense by the Benjamin Regulars held of invading Word of Blake and Federated Suns forces. Damage sustained to the 'mini-suns' during the Jihad resulted in reduced agricultural production and as a result Benjamin required additional imports to keep the planet's population fed.
