      Melissia is covered by a massive single continent that covers an entire hemisphere and runs from pole to pole. The Continent earned the nickname Jahreszeitwunder (“Seasons of Wonder”) due to the extreme seasons experienced on the planet. The northern and southernmost latitudes in the span of a day can potentially experience the extremes of all seasons. Broad Run, a massive river, almost divides the continent in half. The Broad Run runs from the Valiant Mountains, located along the western edge of the continent and empties into a sea at the Broad Run Delta in the east. North of the Delta lies the loveless Valley, home to a vast percentage of local farmlands. The planetary capital and principal spaceport of Europa also call the Valley home. Rich deposits of titanium are located beneath the northern ice shelf. Melissia was originally discovered and settled by colonists from nearby Coventry. Melissia is a self-sufficient, modestly industrial world.

      Melissia is home to Grumman-Cri, a facility built by Grumman Amaglamated during the Word of Blake Jihad to build Marksman Artillery Vehicles. The facility initially gained a cool welcome by the locals, due to the reputation of Grumman as the manufacturer of the Ontos tanks, staples in the Free Worlds League Military. The Grumman-Cri facility is located in the small town of Broad Run, located in the wetlands of Jahreszeitwunder.
