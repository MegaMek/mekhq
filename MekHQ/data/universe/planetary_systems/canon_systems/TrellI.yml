      Trell I (aka Trel I or "Trellwan") is an arid, inhospitable planet. With almost no surface water and planetary days lasting over 30 Terran days the average planetary temperature swings wildly during the day and night cycle (from a high in the 40s during the day at the equator to as low as -80 at night near the poles). Another interesting fact is the short rotation around it’s sun. Trell I’s years are only 45 Standard days.

      Due to the lack of water and thus lack of vegetation most of the planet is covered in vast deserts and barren craggy mountains. The local population has long resented the Lyran Commonwealth for what they believe to be inadequate defense against raids by pirates and the Draconis Combine.
