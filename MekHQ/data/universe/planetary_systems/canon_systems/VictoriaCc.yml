      Victoria's severe weather conditions, including almost-daily hailstorms, have resulted in underground dwellings with strict building codes. Victoria has developed a beautiful array of domed parks to satisfy the population's desire for sunlight. These domed parks have become a tourist attraction, bringing visitors from across the Confederation.

      Victoria has a booming economy. Students that show an aptitude for engineering compete for entry to the famous Victoria Institute of Engineering. Graduates are in high demand and command large fees, a portion of which automatically go to the Victorian Exchequer.

      In the early 31st Century an underground Star League-era â€˜Mech research facility was rediscovered.

      Victoria is home to several military manufacturing centers, including an Earthwerks Limited BattleMech facility and a Shengli Arms BattleMech factory are both located in the mountains, while Trellis Electronics, which produces communication and targeting and tracking systems in the city of Trellis. Victoria is also home to the famous Victoria Academy of Arms and Technology, which is also located in the city of Trellis and is a major center of study for technicians and trains more techs than it does MechWarriors, Aerospace pilots and combat vehicle crews combined.

      Manufacturing centers:
      Earthwerks Limited
      Shengli Arms
