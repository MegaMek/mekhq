      Port Arthur is a nearly idyllic breadbasket world that has been fundamental in feeding neighboring systems. The planet remained relatively untouched throughout the Succession Wars, suffering only two raids by House Steiner forces. However, during the Clan Invasion, Port Arthur was captured by the Smoke Jaguars.

      The capital city is Affendale and is a sprawling metropolis, with no buildings taller than 30 meters, each avenue is filled with local foliage, and there are numerous parks. The greenery of the city belies its size and dense population. The city was heavily damaged during the Smoke Jaguar occupation but rebuilt quickly after the planet returned to Combine control. To combat the urban sprawl due to an expanding population and building height-restrictions limiting population density, city-planners began creating an expansive underground for Affendale, with most buildings expanding underground and numerous paths and tunnels connecting properties.

      During the Succession Wars, Port Arthur lost numerous water purification plants, which left the planet reliant on water from off-world due to being unable to clean the bacteria-contamination from its water. The purification systems were rebuilt based on technology in the Helm Memory Core.
