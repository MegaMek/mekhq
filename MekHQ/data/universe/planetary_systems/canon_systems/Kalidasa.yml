      Located on the border of the Free Worlds League and Lyran Commonwealth and the site of vital manufacturing centers and a large military base, Kalidasa has been a site of countless battles between the Commonwealth and League over its history. During the 31st Century the planet was established as a trade center between the Free Worlds League and Lyran Commonwealth which resulted in a reduction of military action on Kalidasa and allowed the planet to flourish.

      Supported by light industry, mining and refinery, trade on Kalidasa is brisk as goods from all over the Commonwealth and League are brought together and exchanged.

      Kalidasa's primary military concerns are the Kali Yama Weapons Industries Incorporated 'Mech factory located in the city of Westport and the Quikscell combat vehicle plant located in the planetary capital, Sakuntalem. Both cities are located on the Kalmia continent. Kalidasa is also home to an impressive militia training facility that is also based in the capital and trains MechWarriors, conventional armor crews and unarmored infantry.
