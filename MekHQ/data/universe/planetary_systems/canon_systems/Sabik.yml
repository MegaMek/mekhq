      Orbitting twin stars, each between three and four times the mass of Terra‘s Sol, it‘s a miracle that a potentially life-bearing world like Sabik could exist at all. Still, aside from a breathable atmosphere and a limited supply of free water, very little about Sabik was found to recommend this world for settlement during its initial surveys. The land, almost universally rugged and dry, with abrupt cliffs and mountains, interspersed by rocky badlands and the occasional asteroid crater, supported but one form of life: an exceptionally stubborn purple-leaved plant that carpets most of its deep valleys and chasms. A disappointing lack of sizable mineral deposits, infertile soil, and high year-round temperatures kept away prospective colonists and industries.

      By the time of the Star League, only a handful of rugged frontier settlers had claimed this barren world as their home, where they eked out an existence by braving hazardous terrain and blazing heat to mine the planet‘s few veins of industrial metals. The Star League, however, saw value in Sabik as a potential base for military training and technological development, and established their Harsh Terrain Test Center and a Special Arms Services Training Center to test new BattleMechs, vehicles, and troops in its brutal environment.

      After the League‘s collapse, the Draconis Combine assumed control of this world and established a small military presence for potential operations against the Lyran Commonwealth. Despite a minimum of population, ComStar established an HPG on this world, as they, too, took an interest in a planet abandoned by General Kerensky‘s departing fleet. What ComStar discovered, completely without the Dragon‘s knowledge, in fact, was the presence of an SLDF staging base, hidden well beneath the HTTC command center. In addition to two companies of mixed BattleMechs and vehicles, the base also had detailed computer files on every Combine and Commonwealth planet within five jumps of Sabik.

      As of the 32nd century, this world is little more than an outpost, with no agricultural or mineral wealth worth exploiting, though some corporations have expressed an interest—as many before—in mining the hazardous asteroid belts, and using Sabik itself as a home for their local headquarters. Sabik has no continents per se, but boasts a single ocean in its northern hemisphere, Black Oasis, from which a number of minor rivers radiate across the otherwise barren surface. Mofestos is located on the northern shores of this ocean, a mere 500 kilometers from the planet‘s north pole.
