    desc: Despite looking like a 'perfect' planet on paper, Matsuida is a miserable
      plane to live on. The planet has only two continents and both are dominated
      by rough badlands and deserts that are completely unlivable. The only arable
      land on the planet is around the coastal regions, though the seas of Matsuida
      are unique in their gelatinous peasoup colored water, leading to the planet's
      nickname "Nausea". Despite this, the fishing industry thrives on Matsuida and
      the capital Mystique Bay is one of the largest fishing centers in all of the
      Combine. Matsuida is best known for its large fishing industry and infamously
      known for the prison system. Prisoners of the Combine can agree to work the
      often deadly fishing boats of Matsuida in exchange for having their sentences
      shortened. The Combine has found this to be an effective way to remove troublesome
      prisoners without actually executing them. There are also rumors that a gargantuan
      sea serpent named Gawdzeria has been seen of its coast by fishermen, but so
      far there has been no proof.
