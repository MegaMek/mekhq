      MacLeod’s Land was a critical world to the Taurian Concordat prior to the Reunification War due to its large population, massive industrial base and significant agricultural concerns. Unfortunately, that made it a target for the Star League Defense Force during the War and between the tactics of the SLDF and the tactics of Taurian defenders, the planet’s population was decimated and its cities and manufacturing centers all but destroyed and much of the countryside was contaminated. Even after centuries to rebuild and the decontaminate, MacLeod’s Land is still a shadow of its former glory, though some of its industry was rebuilt and enough arable land remained uncontaminated that the planet still produces excess agriculture. The planet is home to a Pinard Protectorates Unlimited BattleMech factory, located in the city of Castigere on the continent of Heather.
