      Lothario is an ice covered planet with a thin atmosphere and beautiful auroras. The population centers on planet are all located within the marginally habitable regions along the equator and still most of the population subsides in subterranean dwellings. The primary industries and trade on Lothario are involved with mining iron and copper, and the fur trade.

      The population of Lothario did not take well to their absorption by the Marian Hegemony and unrest continued throughout the Word of Blake Jihad and even saw the destruction of the planet’s HPG and other infrastructure. As of 3080, the planet was expected to regain its independence ‘in the near future’ and reform the Lothian League.

      The ice covered planet is difficult to live on and dangerous, with numerous native predators, some of which are as large as an adult Terran Polar Bear when they are first born. However, these same predators, and their prey, drive the booming fur trade of Lothario.
