    desc: Life on Pain and The Rack, the two worlds ruled by Morrison's Extractors
      is cruel and difficult. These worlds are even targeted by other pirate bands
      looking to make a name for themselves or simply to feed of the riches stolen
      by the Extractors. The Extractors themselves have eased up on the few thousand
      free people who call Pain and The Rack home, realizing that they need their
      citizens to maintain what little civilization they have. The most believable
      estimates can only narrow down the combined population of Pain and The Rack
      to between fifteen and twenty thousand, half of which are slaves. By all accounts,
      the people who are best off are those who keep to themselves on Pain's far continent,
      Hades.
