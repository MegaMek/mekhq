    desc: When first discovered, Saffel was a rather cold world at the onset of a
      minor ice age. The first colonists were hardy folk from Terra‘s Siberian, Scandinavian
      and Canadian regions, who found the cooler temperatures reminiscent of their
      homelands and planned to build cities on the north polar continent of Dovejin,
      Saffel‘s largest landmass. This frigid land, half-covered in a glacial ice cap,
      was considered an ideal location due to the large metal deposits detected during
      early surveys. Unfortunately, before these rich veins could be tapped, the so-called
      Outer Reaches Rebellion broke out, leading to the eventual collapse of the Terran
      Alliance‘s dominion over its far-flung worlds. With it went the fledgling settlements‘
      only means of support. Unable to obtain the equipment necessary to turn their
      new home into an economically viable system and poorly equipped to handle their
      sudden, unasked-for independence as the harsh Saffel winter set in, many of
      these first colonists perished. By the time the Terran Hegemony formed nearly
      100 years later, the surviving population had migrated to the warmer equatorial
      zones, particularly the continents of Awonera and Sophrati. Eking out an existence
      in the rugged, thickly wooded plains of these new lands, the scattered communities
      didn‘t know what to make of the arrival of new settlers from the Hegemony, especially
      when these newcomers claimed the early cities that had been abandoned by their
      forebears. A brief brushfire conflict broke out between the old and new inhabitants
      of Saffel before the Hegemony government managed to negotiate a truce. In the
      heyday of the Star League, Saffel became known as an exporter of valuable metals,
      as well as home to the Saffel Medical Institute. Located in the city of Radjik
      on Awonera, the SMI developed a revolutionary instrument, the Eligus Diagnoser,
      which was capable of rapidly scanning a patient‘s body, identifying any known
      ailments and rendering a diagnosis. Although it was withheld briefly to prevent
      a panic in the medical community, as some suspected the device could put doctors
      out of work, the eventual unveiling of the Eligus Diagnoser put Saffel on the
      map, adding valuable medical equipment to the planet‘s list of exports. After
      the collapse of the Star League, Davion forces promptly seized Saffel and established
      the planet as a gathering point for troops in one of the first major campaigns
      against House Kurita. In response, the Combine launched a devastating attack
      in 2787 but failed to capture the planet. Over the following centuries, Saffel
      was raided and invaded several times but remained largely under the Davion sunburst
      until the Draconis Combine managed to take the planet after the Fourth Succession
      War. During the Blakist Jihad, the planet suffered minimal damage save for the
      destruction of Farwind, a city on the edge of the Dovejin ice cap, which barracked
      the small planetary militia. Saffel today is a peaceful world with a modest
      metal trade and a subsistence-level agricultural sector. The capital city of
      Iwanji, located on the southern coast of Dovejin, also serves as the largest
      commercial spaceport.
