    desc: Tellman’s Mistake is a backwater planet located near the Free Worlds League
      Periphery with an economy based on agriculture. The planet was settled entirely
      based on a comfortable climate and fertile soil. Initial settlers encountered
      a problem with a native bat-like species that was prone to attacking humans.
      While the bite was only momentarily painful the bites often resulted in fevers
      and illness in those bit. After several people died the colonists began to question
      settling on the planet, fortunately most people survived and it was soon discovered
      that for most people the bat’s saliva actually worked to strengthen their immune
      system after the initial fever, unfortunately in rare cases, those with a rare
      blood type had an adverse reaction. The planet has almost no industry of its
      own and the planet has a very low tech infrastructure. Almost everything must
      be imported, including meat as none of the native species are edible by humans.
