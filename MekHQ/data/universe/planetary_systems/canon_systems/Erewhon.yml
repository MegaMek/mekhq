    desc: Erewhon was originally a holding of the Rim World Republic and fell into
      obscurity after the Republics collapse. The planet lived on as a quiet rural
      Periphery world, best known for its wool exports from the large sheep population.
      Despite the planet’s relatively low gravity and low atmospheric pressure, Erewhon
      is capable of supporting enough agriculture to make it self sufficient and feed
      the large flocks of sheep. In the early 31st century the planet became part
      of the Greater Valkyrate, until it was conquered by Clan Jade Falcon during
      Operation Revival. Under the Falcons, Erewhon saw a surge in technology and
      industry as the Falcon scientist caste migrated to the planet. The planet suffered
      some severe infrastructure damage during the early 3070s.
