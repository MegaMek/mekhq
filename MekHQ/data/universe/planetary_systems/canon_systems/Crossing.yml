      3028 - Crossing is a vital defensive planet along the Federated Suns and Draconis Combine border and the planet’s name has proven to be exceptionally fitting since it has been used for centuries as a waystation for troops and supplies moving through the Draconis March. The planet saw so much use as a logistical lynchpin that almost the entire southern continent of Charon was reserved as a military reservation for supplies and rest and recreation facilities for the AFFS.

      The other primary continent, Ganse, is in the western hemisphere and is home to Averrant City, the planetary capital and home to the planet’s largest non-military spaceport. The Shores are a major tourist attraction for civilians throughout the Draconis March due to the sea’s exceptionally clear waters and are located a short fourteen kilometers south of Averrant City.

      Two of the planets four moons house military bases used to defend the planet and as testing grounds. The base on Wayfarer is the third-largest aerospace proving ground in the Draconis March and the moon’s firing ranges are used to test new munitions and seeker heads for quality. The moon Trinket is the primary hostile environment warfare center for the Draconis March Militia and can house up to two infantry regiments for training. However, Trinket is uncomfortable for long-term habitation and as a result there are daily shuttle flights to rotate troops on a regular basis between Trinket and Crossing.

      A large portion of the population on Crossing is made up of retired AFFS veterans and their families, with the cities of Crassus and New Rhodes made up almost entirely of retired personnel.
