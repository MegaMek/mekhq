      Tortuga is a planet of vast grassy plains and abundant natural resources. Unfortunately by the 31st Century most of the once abundant raw materials had been extracted and used. Tortuga is the infamous center of the Tortuga Dominions pirate realm.

      3080: Tortuga Prime is a hostile planet with limited surface water, most of the planet’s limited drinking water must be pulled from deep underground. There are seven major cities on Tortuga Prime and all of them are located on Torment, the planets single large continent. The ‘pirate world’ is home to the Vengeance Incorporated factory, which is rumored to produce a line of BattleMechs as well as several lines of standard, reliable tanks. The location of the manufacturing center is unknown to outside sources, though it is likely located somewhere on Torment.
