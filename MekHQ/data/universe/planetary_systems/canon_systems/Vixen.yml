    desc: 3025 â€“ Vixen was not settled until the early 3020s and was colonized by
      a handful of corporations intent on making the cool-temperate world into a pleasure
      planet. While there are only a few thousand settlers currently on Vixen, most
      of them are engaged in the various tourist and entertainment enterprises on
      planet and in the few years since 'opening', the planet has already attracted
      thousands of vacationing Canopians. The planet's colder regions are home to
      some of the magistracy's most elite winter sports competitions, with the ten-mile
      cross-country skiing event, bobsledding and the brutal 'all-girl' hockey league,
      known for its gamesmanship and fights. Another draw to Vixen are the extensive
      hunting grounds in and around the untouched wilderness of the southern continent
      and the planet's large native mammalian lifeforms.
