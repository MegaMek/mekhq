      Great Gorge is a planet with little to draw in settlers. The planet has a thin atmosphere, scarce water, and only primitive plant-like lifeforms. Additionally the planet is covered in rough mountains and canyons with little arable land. This all changed when a religious group from Terra decided to settle the planet just prior to the formation of the Star League.

      The colonists spread desert-grass seeds from the air across the planet and seeded the few bodies of water with iron-fish eggs. The grass and the fish took to the planet miraculously well. The grass greatly increased the oxygen in the atmosphere and the fish thrived on the native algae. By the time the Star League collapsed, the population of Great Gorge was completely self-sufficient and did not require imported food and the originally thin-atmosphere had enough oxygen for humans to comfortably breathe.

      Of added benefit, the canyons and mountains that cover much of the planet were discovered to be rich with easily mined metals and chemical compounds, which resulted in a boom prosperous economy for the planet. Unfortunately, the planet’s proximity to the Periphery combined with the planet’s wealth has made Great Gorge a popular target for pirate raids over the centuries.
