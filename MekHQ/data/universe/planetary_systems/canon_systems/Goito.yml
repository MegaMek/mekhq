    desc: Goito is a cold planet that barely qualifies as temperate, though the equatorial
      region is warm enough to support significant arable land and the planet has
      bountiful agricultural concerns. Aside from the arable land, Goito has had little
      else to attract significant military attention and did not suffer significant
      damage during the Succession Wars. Goito was part of the Draconis Combine for
      most of its history before becoming part of the Free Rasalhague Republic, until
      the planet was conquered by Clan Ghost Bear during Operation Revival. Years
      after being captured, the Bears decided to locate one of their mobile factories
      on Goito to avoid concentrating all of their industry on Alshain.
