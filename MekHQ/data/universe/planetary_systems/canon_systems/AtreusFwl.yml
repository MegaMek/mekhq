      First colonized in 2160, Atreus was the furthest colony from Earth when it was originally settled. It became the capital of the Free Worlds League in 2271.

      Atreus is a temperate planet much like Terra. It has a single moon and four continents, all of which are inhabited. The capital city of Atreus, seat of the Free Worlds League central government, is on the contined of Ionis. For most of its history Atreus City the "City of Dreams" has been a favorite vacation spot for League toursists.

      The League intelligence branch, SAFE, is headquartered on Atreus' moon Wendigo. The planet is home to many major manufacturing centers, universities and academies.
