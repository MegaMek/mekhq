      Les Halles is an arctic planet with only a narrow equatorial band that is capable of comfortably supporting human life. Les Halles is located at a strategic location along the border of the Free Worlds League and the Capellan Confederation, which has often made it a military target, the planet also serves as a major trade hub. Les Halles supports several cities built around the multiple spaceports on planet. The spaceports are often ringed by large warehouses full of various goods and resources both mundane and exotic. While trade is heavily monitored it is no secret that Les Halles has a thriving black-market.

      The primary industry on Les Halles is the extraction and refining of fuel used in spacecraft. In the mid to late 31st Century an orbital repair yard was constructed to serve as a repair and maintenance station as well as a cargo-waystation.
