    desc: 3025 - Wildwood is a major agricultural world best known throughout the
      Magistracy of Canopus and into the Free Worlds League for its vineyards and
      fine wines. Much of the planet has been left undeveloped and the majority of
      the terrain remains virgin wilderness. The planet is sparsely populated beyond
      the handful of farms and vineyards and a small tourist trade that offers tours
      through the wilderness. Wildwood is popular among bird watchers for its unique
      avian population.
