    desc: The terrestrial planet of Mara was settled in the early age of colonial
      expansion, after it was recognized for the pleasant agricultural world it could
      be. Though industrial metals may be found in small veins—particularly among
      the remote Northern Isles and on the small south-polar continent of Naramo—the
      fertile, wooded lands and freshwater lakes on Appilagio, the planet‘s large
      main continent, are the source of almost all the planet‘s industry. Much of
      the logging industry, for one of Mara‘s chief exports, is focused around the
      Great Rim—site of a long-ago asteroid impact on Appilagio. The majority of Mara‘s
      settlements are concentrated inland of the Great Rim area, near these logging
      operations, in a temperate region of plains and large lakes that in many ways
      resembles the climate of Terra‘s European-Mediterranean region. The planetary
      capital city of Terrace is located on the northern Broomstick Plains, roughly
      forty kilometers inland of the Great Rim, near the smaller coastal city of Mountlake,
      which is itself home to Hara-Maku Enterprises, owners of Mara‘s largest commercial
      fishing fleet. Hara-Maku‘s operations, which focus mainly on harvesting the
      delicate freshwater Mara Trout, found in many of Appilagio‘s inland seas, lakes,
      and rivers, accounts for most of the planet‘s secondary food-export industry.
      The spaceport city of Lockholme, located in the southern peninsula of Appilagio,
      is also home to Mara Development Corporation, a construction equipment company
      that specializes in the manufacture of both Forestry and Construction ‘Mech
      designs.
