      Ward was settled during the early Exodus from Terra by Utopians as an experimental community based on the principles of harmony and co-operative activity. Although the First Ward Constitution was scrapped in 2644 and replaced with a constitution that favored free trade and greater military activity, the original Utopian principles have survived to through the Succession Wars to a surprising degree. The First Ward Constitution remains one of the most widely studied Exodus-era historical documents.

      The populace of Ward is well known for their skilled construction work and their construction firms take a large number of contracts off-world to construct roads through the most difficult terrain of neighboring star systems. Wardian road construction methods use a material that far exceeds all other known road construction materials in terms of resisting weather, temperature, and stress. This formula is one of the most closely guarded industrial secrets in the Inner Sphere.

      Ward's northern polar cap is the site of a Confederation observation-intelligence post.
