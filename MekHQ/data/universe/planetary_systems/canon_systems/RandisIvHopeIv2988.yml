      Originally known as Hope IV and later New Hope, the planet was renamed Randis IV near the end of the 30th Century when a former Free Worlds League MechWarrior named Erdelmaine Randis formed the Fiefdom of Randis and the Brotherhood of Randis. The planet has acted as the home of this monastic order of MechWarriors ever since.

      Randis IV is a tropical world that contains few natural resources. The planet was originally settled by refugees fleeing the 1st and 2nd Succession Wars.

      3080 - The planet Randis is dominated by water and has relatively limited land space and had a rough history after the fall of the Star League until the end of the 30th century when the Brotherhood of Randis took up residence on the planet and Hope (often referred to as Lost Hope by the desperate residents) was renamed to Randis. After the arrival of the Brotherhood, the planet Randis has seen a revitalization, with its population swelling and a growth in industry. Though industrial growth is tightly controlled by the Brotherhood to protect the environment. The capital, Hope City, is located on the continent Hope and is home to the Hope Industrial Works which produces primitive BattleMechs, which primarily go to the Brotherhood but excess ‘Mechs are sold to neighboring worlds. The capital city is home to to nearly half the entire planet’s population. The Brotherhood’s Monastery is located in the mountains overlooking Hope City and is the primarily training ground for new Knight-Candidates of the order.
