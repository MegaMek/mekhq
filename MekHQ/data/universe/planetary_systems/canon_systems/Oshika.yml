    desc: For most of its history, Oshika has been a prefecture capital world. As
      a result, its cities and industry (what little there is of it) are all geared
      towards the efficient running of the government. The capital city, Takadanobaba,
      is located in Oshika's only mountain range the Trilby Mountains. The DCMS headquarters
      is also located there, which means political power actually flows from the garrisoning
      military unit. The world has little to recommend it for colonization, as it
      is poor in both natural resources and nutrient weak soil, barely capable of
      food production on its own. As a result Oshika requires the import of chemical
      fertilizers. In 3025 several entrepreneurs tried to raise the Oshika Ox (a cross
      between an elephant and a cow) for commercial export. The Oshika Ox was already
      a popular foodstuff on Oshika and exporting the animal seemed a logical next
      step. However, as of 3079 this venture seems to have failed.
