    desc: 3135 - Many of the locals on Menkent refer to their world as the burial
      site of the Marsden dynasty, thanks to the heroic death of the Lyran Commonwealth‘s
      second Archon, Alistair Marsden, on the Plain of Dust just outside the capital
      city of Blackstone in 2408. Marsden, who died leading a tank regiment during
      the Age of War, left behind his widow, Katherine Marsden-Steiner, the woman
      who would rule the Commonwealth and establish the Great House of Steiner. This
      simple historical event at once turned the sandy, sun-blasted world of Menkent
      into a tourist attraction for those willing to brave its closeness to the Draconis
      Combine border. Lit by a large, orange subgiant, which it orbits just a little
      too closely, Menkent itself is a warm planet, less than half of which is covered
      by water, and that is so salty that it requires purifiers to drink. Even inland
      seas and rivers require treatment before they can be used for drinking and irrigation,
      making life here difficult, but not impossible. At the time of Marsden‘s death,
      House Kurita had managed to overtake this world, and it would trade hands between
      Steiner and Kurita many times before and after the days of the original Star
      League. Effectively little more than a barren wasteland—its principal exports
      being limited to common metals and small machines—Menkent‘s local infrastructure
      was ravaged by the centuries of continuous warfare. During the Jihad, insult
      was added to centuries of injury when Blakist WarShips made an incidental bombardment
      pass over Blackstone after a strike on nearby Skye. The capital city and its
      surrounding towns, however, were already partially rebuilt by the time the war
      ended and Menkent was turned over to Devlin Stone‘s nascent Republic of the
      Sphere. Blackstone stands at the junction of three rivers on Terrasota, the
      largest and most populous of the planet‘s three continents. The other two continents,
      Areseppi and Aphirojia, are both equatorial continents, where the arid climate
      and local dust storms have made habitation more difficult than normal, and thus
      both are far less densely populated.
