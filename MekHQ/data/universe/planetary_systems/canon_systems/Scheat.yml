    desc: 3135 - A world of heavy rainfall, rich soil, and basic metals, Scheat became
      an industrialized world soon after the first colonists made planetfall. Lumber
      and common raw metals such as aluminum and iron made up the bulk of the planetary
      economy, with textiles forming a supplemental export. Only moderately successful
      in comparison to neighboring systems, very little made this world stand out
      in the early years of human expansion into the galaxy. Many cities arose on
      the primary temperate continents of Kohl and Warschen, centered on the local
      timber industries and mining establishments, while agricultural settlements
      developed along the winding rivers that connected many of these cities. In the
      days of the Terran Hegemony, Scheat was a Hegemony border world to the Draconis
      Combine, and so military outposts and a small ‘Mech repair and refit complex
      were placed on the world for the benefit of defending troops. When the Star
      League fell, these assets became natural targets for the feuding Great Houses,
      and were largely destroyed in the fighting. Only in the past decade have efforts
      to reclaim the devastated facilities borne fruit with the opening of Landhome
      Industrial ‘Mech Enterprises, producer of construction, mining, and forestry
      ‘Mech designs. The LIME plant is located on Waschen, while the planetary capital
      and primary spaceport lie in the foothills of Kohl. The large, lake-riddled
      equatorial continent of Rhodes is Scheat‘s only other major landmass, and it
      is home to the industrial city of Valorie, where Valorie Metals, Unlimited,
      Scheat‘s largest mining concern, is headquartered.
