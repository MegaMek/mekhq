      Kirchbach spent most of its history on the border between the Lyran Commonwealth and the Draconis Combine and managed to trade hands multiple times, before ultimately becoming part of the Free Rasalhague Republic, only to be captured by Clan Wolf during Operation Revival and later the Hell’s Horses. The unfortunate location of Kirchbach meant that the planet has been the site of frequent raids and invasions from the Commonwealth, Combine, Clans and due to its proximity to the Periphery, pirates, throughout its history.

      The planet has moderate natural resources and enough arable land to sustain itself, however Kirchbach has never had any standout features to make it a world of any prominence beyond being a border world. After being ceded to the Free Rasalhague Republic, the Republic spent considerable funds expanding the planet’s moderate industry to produce combat vehicles and ‘Mech scale weaponry. The factory was eventually repurposed by Clan Hell’s Horses when they captured Kirchbach from the Wolves.
