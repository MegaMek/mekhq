      Ovan is a Capellan "core" world, relatively close to Sian and rarely raided,mostly for lack of anything to raid. Settled in 2393 by Chinese at the behest of the Capellan government. Socially and technologically Ovan is a typical human-inhabited world. However, Environmentally speaking, Ovan is definitely abnormal.

      Orvan orbits a dim red star, known as "Ember" to locals. It is in a circular 16 day orbit. The length of the day does not vary during the year due to negligible equatorial tilt. Further, Ember is an old star; it shows few flare behaviors common to younger red dwarfs. This means that Ovan is also old, showing up in its depleted oceans, it continues to be habitable thanks to a thick atmosphere. Rains are extremely predictable coming at dusk as the humid, saturated, daytime air begins to cool. This cycle is so dependable and tectonic drift so limited that a "World River" (20 to 500km wide) has been carved around the equator where daily heating and cooling are greatest. Though Ovan technically has numerous continental plates, the World River divides the planet into two approximately equal landmasses.

      Human habitation on Ovan forms continuous bands of cities along the north and south coasts of the World River; transportation is dominated by water traffic, as well as roads and railways that run parallel to the river bank. The unimaginatively named North and South Metropoli are mostly 1 to 20km in distance from the coastlines, compressed by the demands of keeping farms near major water sources, the rivers rarely reach more than 200km inland, and the need of the local nobles to keep their peasants under observation. This gives Ovan a high population density in its main urban areas and leaves it virtually uninhabited elsewhere, save for mining operations and noble's farming estates. The terrain along the World River is varied; anything from salt flats to steep cliffs.

      Ovan was once an industrial linchpin for the Confederation. It was long settled, populous, possessing abundant mineral resources and with a short transit to planetary jump points, where squadrons of recharge stations cut recharge time by days. This prosperity ended with the Succession Wars, which cut Ovan's access to cheap water filters, destroyed most of its recharge stations and destroyed its merchant fleets. On-planet raids against Ovan's advanced factories left the world abjectly poor. Standards of living have continued to sink, but this was only partly due to war damaged-industry, agriculture and mining reached stable levels during the Second Succession War. After the raids of the 1st Succession War, however, the new government reveled in the power it gained over the citizenry and has become one of the longest-running and most stable Kleptocracies in the Inner Sphere.

      On Ovan, local nobles have come to exercise complete control over the citizenry by their ownership of all of the desalinization units, power plants and farms, and by careful appointment of family members and cronies in the bureaucracy. The nobles enforce their rule and discourage citizens from seeking aid from the Confederation by showing exceeding loyalty to Sian, which in turn looks the other way when reports of abuse by Ovan nobles are received. The nobles also abuse their rights to create military ranks by forming huge private militias, comprised primarily of gangs of club-wielding thugs, and levying taxes on their fiefs. The difference between Ovan and other Kleptocracies is that the government has learned enough moderation to make their plundering sustainable for generations.
