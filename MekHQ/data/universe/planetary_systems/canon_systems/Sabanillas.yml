      Sabanillas is yet another Federated Suns outback, lowly populated, with low industry and low technology, the planet’s economy is primarily supported by mining of rare metals, minerals and gems as well as a plentiful supply of more common ores. The planet itself is mostly lifeless and barely able to sustain any life, the human population relies substantially on imported goods. The world is almost entirely inhabited by miners and their families and has been that way for generations. Due primarily to a lack of interest in living there otherwise. However, a little known slogan for Sabanillas is “anything goes”. While the mining companies don’t pay well and the planet is not a comfortable planet to live on, they make sure the employees and their families are happy thanks to a constant supply of imported goods and other services that would be illegal on most planets.

      Raids to capture the mineral wealth of Sabanillas are not unheard of and as a result most of the mining operations employ strong security forces both on planet and in space.
