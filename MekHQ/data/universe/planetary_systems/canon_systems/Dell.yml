    desc: Dell is a relatively comfortable, if somewhat cool, temperate planet that
      was part of the Lyran Commonwealth for most of its history. Dell’s primary industries
      are agriculture and aerospace production. The planet was the site of the Bowie
      Industries’ Chippewa Aerospace Fighter factory until Clan Wolf captured the
      planet during Operation Revival. After Dell was conquered by Clan Wolf, the
      Bowie factory sat abandoned for more than a decade before Clan Wolf began retooling
      the factory in order to restart their aerospace industry after the Wolves were
      displaced from the Clan Homeworlds.
