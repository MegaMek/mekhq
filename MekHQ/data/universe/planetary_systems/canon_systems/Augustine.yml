      Augustine was originally settled as a religious colony by Jesuits. However, since its founding the planet has attracted a broad range of peoples and religions and grew to be an important part of the Marik Commonwealth. Unfortunately brutal fighting during the early Succession Wars saw the population drop by more than half. Additionally the famous Seminary and much of the planet’s infrastructure was destroyed.

      However, by the early 31st century this turned around and Augustine began to rebuild and repopulate as many people immigrated to the hospitable warm-temperate planet.

      The primary industries on Augustine involve extracting raw minerals from the planet and processing petrochemicals on the northern continent of Kabuko and agriculture on other two continents, Roma and Grecian.
