      Inglesmond is one of many planets within the Terran Hegemony that was only colonized thanks to terraforming efforts in the late 23rd century. Despite extremely short and severe seasons that freeze the planet in the short winters and bake it during the summers, the planet thrived for centuries under the Hegemony and more than a billion people called it home. The planet was home to thriving agriculture, technology, and industry, including massive orbital shipyards.

      Unfortunately, Inglesmond shared its fate with so many other Hegemony worlds. Crippled during the Civil War and finished during the First Succession War when the planet found itself in the midst of a four-way battle between the Inglesmond defenders, Draconis Combine, Federated Suns, and Lyran Commonwealth that ended in scorched earth tactics by all three Houses and left the planet in ruins from nuclear and biological weapons.

      The planet was declared uninhabited by Comstar in 2822 and removed from star charts. Not all the human inhabitants were dead, however, those that remained returned to hunter-gatherer levels of society.
