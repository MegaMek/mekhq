      Hotter and drier than the Game World itself, with nowhere near the universal renown, Westerhand has nonetheless remained a haven for various mercenary commands despite an increasingly competitive hiring market. Located in the Sian Commonality of the Capellan Confederation, just one jump shy of the Free Worlds League's Duchy of Andurien, this world first came into use as a mercenary recruitment center during the reign of Chancellor Maximilian Liao, though the original intent was not aimed at the mercenary profession at all, but rather at stimulating an entertainment industry similar to the Solaris Games.

      In the center of the Victory City's business district is the Westerhand Hiring Hall, a six-story structure of mirrored glass, steel, and marble whose ultra-modern architecture sets it apart from the rest of the business district. The building is based on the original Mercenary's Guild Hall, which stood during the reign of Chancellor Maximillian Liao (when it was managed largely by ComStar's Mercenary Review Board).

      The hall features offices, meeting rooms, and communications facilities for employers and mercenary negotiators alike, as well as access to 'Mech and vehicle simulators. Technically, the offices and conference rooms are secure, allowing representatives from foreign powers to barter for the services of mercenary warriors as well as Capellan recruiters, but many mercenaries and foreign employers still take precautions when discussing the particulars of missions and contract terms, for fear of the remote possibility that the Maskirovka might be listening.

      Presently, aside from the Games and the Hiring Hall, Westerhand does not feature training facilities, but a number of local and offworld agencies have expressed an interest in establishing either specialized, bare-bones martial colleges or even a full-scale military university catering to the mercenary profession. Furthermore, rumors have begun to circulate that the Westerhand Hiring Hall may seek MRBC sanction in order to improve its standing as a place for professional soldiers to do business.
