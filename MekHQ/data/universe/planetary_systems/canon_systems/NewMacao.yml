      3060: New Macao was founded prior to the founding of the Star League primarily by settlers from Portugal. The planet was soon absorbed into the Sarna Supremacy before ultimately ending up in the Capellan Confederation. The biggest challenge for early settlers was the Ventosa Virus, which quickly claimed the lives of a dozen settlers to the continent of Ventosa. An anti-viral that targets the virus was created within a decade and has all but eradicated the disease since.The planet has a comfortable cool-temperate climate and nearly standard gravity, though a slightly lower pressure atmosphere than Terra. The planet has limited natural resources and relies heavily on outside imports to feed the well established technology and industrial firms located on New Macao.

      New Macao was spared the worst of the Succession Wars and only changed hands during the 4th Succession War when the Federated Suns invaded. The planet did well under the Federated Commonwealth but found itself left to fend for itself after 3057 when the realm sundered after Operation Guerrero. With the lack of the Commonwealth, shipments of materials dried up and businesses in New Macao began to suffer from the shortages as planetary exports declined sharply.

      New Macao was re-absorbed by the Capellan Confederation in the late 3060s just prior to the start of the Word of Blake Jihad. The war continued to cause disruptions to the planet’s imports and exports.

      New Macao has 22 hour days and orbits its sun every 364 standard days.
