    desc: 'Although discovered in the 22nd century, Euclid was not settled until 2632
      because the native ecology produces toxic by-products which taint the air and
      water against terrestrial life. Technologies more readily available under the
      Star League made settlement viable, and biochemical industry boomed, taking
      advantage of the local ecosystem. Although fighting did not reach the planet
      during the first succession war, it caused a decline in availability of the
      technologies that allowed Euclid to be settled. As the infrastructure broke
      down over time, the portion of population which could not afford to emigrate
      was exposed to biochemical agents resulting in asthma-like symptoms, unusual
      diseases, birth defects, and sometimes fatal allergic reactions. Through inoculations,
      sealed living environments, and shear effort, a fraction of the population managed
      to survive until the third succession wars, when the ruling nobility (Count
      Fesser) controlled, and occasionally denied production and distribution of the
      inoculations required to keep the peasant population in relative health. Quality
      (and quantity) of life on Euclid greatly improved when Prince Hanse Davion ''bought
      out'' Fesser, and installed John Zibler in his place. With the introduction
      of affordable eduction programs, and later new filtration and biotechnological
      breakthroughs from Helm Memory Core, the population of Euclid is once again
      beginning to grow. '
