      Palladix is a comfortable temperate planet with abundant arable land but little else to make the planet noteworthy. The capital city of Weilun is located on the vast plains of the Gdansk continent. In the 3070s, Palladix became one of several planets that became home to a Novis AT-H, Incorporated factory producing Tamerlane Strike Sleds. The new factory was located in the rainy city of Czarci on the coasts of Lake Sniardwy on the Polska continent. Unfortunately, residents were quick to complain about the new factoryâ€™s pollution, which reportedly killed of several species of fish from the lake.
