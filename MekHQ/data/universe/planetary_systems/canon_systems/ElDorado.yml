      El Dorado is an Earth-like planet with 6 major continents and large tracts of arable land. This is due to the massive bodies of fresh water, know as The Super Lakes, which are located on the largest continents of San Diego and Los Angeles.

      El Dorado is slightly warmer than Earth and has increased tectonic activity. Over the centuries of colonization populations centers have settled in locations that avoided the most geologically active sites.

      El Dorado has a single moon named Boulder. It appears silver and sapphire and has a thick nitrogen-carbon dioxide atmosphere.

      For much of its early history El Dorado was known for its JumpShip yards. This ended during the 1st Succession War when the Draconis Combine left the Ship Yards in ruins after a raid. The planet itself still remains heavily industrialized and is home to many renowned universities known as the "Guilded Halls". These universities have allowed El Dorado to remain a front runner in technology and manufacturing throughout the Succession Wars. Despite some losses to the Succession Wars, El Dorado is still one of the "Golden Five" core worlds in the Federated Suns.
