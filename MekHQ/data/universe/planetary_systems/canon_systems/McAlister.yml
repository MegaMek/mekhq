      McAlister is a quiet planet with limited industry, few precious natural resources but abundant wilderness and farmland. The planet has near-standard gravity, a comfortable temperate climate and abundant water on its two largest continents. McAlister was originally settled by several distinct groups, Russians primarily colonized the continent they named Novgorod while English colonists settled Northumberland. The remaining continents, McLure and Millerstown are smaller and have less favorable climates. Millerstown is to the far south and is primarily covered in glacial ice, however forests with massive native trees once dominated the northern coasts and gave rise to the name of the only permanent town and the name of the continent. While most of the trees were cut down within decades, efforts have been maintained ever since to regrow the forests. The trees have proved to be slow growing and two centuries later the new forests stand only a third of the height of the forebearers. If not for the iron mines in and around the town, Millerstown would have likely been abandoned when the trees were felled. The final continent, McLure is small and desolate. Located near the equator it is scorched by the planet's sun and receives less than a CM of rain annually and has no bodies of fresh water.

      The planetary capital, Worthentown and primary seat of power are located on the continent of Northumberland, however Selingrad, the primary city of Novgorod is nearly as large and is home to most of McAlister's modest industry. Both continents are modestly populated, primarily covered in farms and small towns with very few large cities. Novogorod is in the northern hemisphere and has significantly longer and colder winters than its southern neighbor Northumberland.
