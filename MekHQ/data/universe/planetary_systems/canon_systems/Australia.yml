      Australia is relatively uninhabited and most of the planet has been purposefully undeveloped in order to better protect one of the Lyran Commonwealth’s Mint and Reserve Banks. Without the Mint, the planet would have no strategic or tactical importance to the Commonwealth. The Mint is located some where near the planetary capital of Woolloomoloo, however the entrances are highly classified secrets and rumors indicate that anyone that has found an entrance and attempted to gain access has either been captured or killed. The Mint is rumored to be highly fortified, to the extent that it could withstand orbital bombardment.

      Despite its small population and lack of development, Australia is home to a major Lyran stock exchange and a significant number of Lyran banks are headquartered on Australia. The planet’s financial importance is the main reason that it is home to one of ComStars rare A class HPGs, as the stock exchange requires constant information to keep the banking industry as up to date as possible.

      Most of the wilds of Queensland, the planet’s largest continent, have remained untouched and are a favorite locale for corporate retreats for the high-level Commonwealth bankers. Airship cruises over the badlands and hunting retreats to the woodlands are common.
