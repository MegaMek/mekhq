    desc: Weingarten is a beautiful planet with long mild growing seasons that make
      it ideal for agriculture, and for most of its history the planet was best known
      for its numerous wineries. Due to the planets’ lack of military value and limited
      industry the planet suffered very little during the Succession Wars and even
      when battles did occur on the planet, attackers were usually careful to avoid
      damaging the vineyards. Things remained much the same, even after the planet
      was captured by Clan Wolf during Operation Revival, until the Word of Blake
      Jihad inflicted serious damage on Tamar, the Wolves’ capital, and forced them
      to relocate. With the relocation, the Wolves quickly expanded their military
      bases and industrial production on Weingarten, going as far as to demolish several
      vineyards to make way for their expanded military presence on the planet. The
      Wolves’ capital returned to Tamar by 3080, unfortunately the damage was already
      done and the industry was already in place, including the W-8 Facilities, capable
      of producing multiple lines of ‘Mechs ‘by hand’.
