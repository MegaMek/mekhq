    desc: Thule is a well-established planet with abundant natural resources and arable
      land, as well as the basic infrastructure necessary to support heavy industry,
      though little industry exists on the Thule. The planet has a comfortable atmosphere
      and temperate climate. The planet was originally a holding of the Draconis Combine
      until the formation of the Free Rasalhague Republic. Unfortunately, like most
      FRR planets, Thule was conquered by Clan Ghost Bear during Operation Revival.
      The Bears hoped to further develop industry on Thule, unfortunately their efforts
      spoiled when Dominion Factory-5 and a nacent DropShip yard were destroyed in
      a three-way fight between Clan Ghost Bear, disguised Clan Burrock warriors and
      Clan Hells Horses in 3074.
