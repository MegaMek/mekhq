      3060: Jonathan is a relatively large planet with a comfortable atmosphere and climate. The planet was colonized prior to the rise of the Star League as part of the Sarna Supremacy before the Supremacy was absorbed by the Capellan Confederation. The planet was relatively unaffected by the Succession Wars, other than minor raiding, until it was captured by the Federated Suns in the 4th Succession War.

      After the Federated Commonwealth split and Operation Guerrero in late 3057, Jonathan was left to fend for itself and was left in the control of the four nobles that owned the inhabited continents Jacqueline, Jeremy, Jeremiah and Jessica. The fifth continent Justin is in the north pole and is primarily uninhabited due to the extremely cold temperatures. After the loss of the FedCom oversight, the four nobles used their small home guards to take absolute control of their own continent and have been vying for control over the others ever since.

      Jonathan was eventually re-absorbed into the Capellan Confederation in the early 3060s.

      Jonathan has a 20 hour day and takes 745 standard days to orbit its sun.
