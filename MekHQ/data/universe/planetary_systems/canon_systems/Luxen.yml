    desc: 3025 - Luxen has survived the worst of the Succession Wars relatively untouched.
      It is a provincial capital and has abundant deposits of precious metals and
      rare gemstones. It is also home to the University of Luxen and the Canopian
      Medical Sciences Research and Training complex, which are some of the few places
      capable of training doctors and other medical personnel in the Magistracy that
      was able to survive the destructiveness of the fall of the Star League and the
      Succession Wars.
