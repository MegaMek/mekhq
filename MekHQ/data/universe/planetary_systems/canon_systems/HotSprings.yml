    desc: Hot Springs was colonized to take advantage of the planet’s abundance of
      mineral and metal ores, however the planet quickly became famous for its rich
      mineral water, which quickly developed into a thriving tourist industry centered
      around the therapeutic hot springs. However, other than the hot springs, there
      is very little to attract vacationers to Hot Springs, the planet’s two continents
      were formed by volcanic activity and the larger continent of Silver Springs
      is primarily black rock and ash, with occasional outcroppings of trees and broken
      up by dense jungle and brackish lakes. The large Lucas Mountains Range in the
      western end of the continent is part of the mountain chain that formed the continent.
      The second continent, Manta Springs, is more livable and is home to much of
      the planet’s population, including the capital city Boulder. Boulder is home
      to the renowned Institute for Advance Studies in Physical Therapy.
