      3135 - Tsitang was originally colonised when St. Andre was colonized and became the agricultural supplier to St Andre and other worlds. Tsitang has a warm and temperate climate that allows most of the continents to have more than three growing seasons annually. Tsitang was a major producer of hardwood timber, bamboo, fruit trees, and a variety of other agricultural products.

      Tsitang‘s three continents have approximately the same landmass and are located in the equatorial zone. Most of the planet‘s timber industry is located on Fang. Fang is slightly larger and was the first continent settled. The capital, Pealung, is located on the eastern coast of Fang. Feng is the smallest continent and produces about 40 percent of the planet‘s agriculture products, specialising in fruit trees. Feng exports most of the products off planet. Fong grows the majority of the planet‘s foodstuff and supplies the local population. Each continent has a DropPort outside of the capital or regional capitals.

      In 2305, Tsitang joined St. Andre in aiding Palos and Wei, and fought a four-year war against the Sarna Supremacy. After the formation of the Capellan Confederation in 2366, Tsitang supplied worlds within one or two jumps with agricultural products for the next seven hundred years.

      Tsitang fell in the second wave of the Fourth Succession War to the Federated Suns. After the war, the planet continued to supply the same worlds that were now part of the Sarna March. The Capellans regained Tsitang after the fragmenting of the Sarna March in 3057. Tsitang was left almost untouched during the Jihad, becoming a refugee centre for many of the worlds they supplied with food.
