    desc: While Ningxia has become known for its diamonds, which are perfect for industrial
      processes, the world was actually settled for its beautiful landscapes. Regarded
      as a planet sized bonsai garden, every effort to exploit the diamond deposites
      has been stopped by highly placed nobles, including Coordinator Takashi Kurita.
      These nobles, as well as many prominent businessmen, maintain vacation homes
      on the picturesque world. The Ningxia has only one city, New Zephyus. It is
      the site of the planet's primary spaceport, but in the 3020's it suffered from
      a series of breakdowns that affected its ability to service DropShips. In fact,
      Ningxia was the site of several DropShip related accidents during this time.
      As a result, the agricultural companies that form the core of the planet's economy
      experienced difficulty in shipping their products. The temporary solution was
      to have DropShips land directly on the farms to load cargo, but most of the
      population was opposed to the practice due to the massive damage it caused.
