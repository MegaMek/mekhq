    desc: Originally an Outworlds Alliance colony populated largely by pacifistic
      farmers and miners, Tabayama was an early target during the invasion of the
      Alliance by Star League forces during the Reunification War. On the 25th of
      July 2585 the Treaty of Cerberus was signed, declaring peace between those involved
      in the conquest of the Outworlds Alliance. When the treaty took effect on the
      1st of August, Tabayama and 13 other planets were formally annexed to the Draconis
      Combine as a part of the treaty terms. In the 31st century Tabayama was the
      capital world of the Galedon Military District's Periphery prefecture. Most
      of the citizens are employed in running the prefecture's government. Interestingly,
      the importation of white-tailed deer from Terra has led to an ecological crisis.
      Lacking natural predators, these deer reproduce so quickly that the human population
      is in constant danger of losing their croplands. In 3025 more than two million
      citizens of Tabayama were employed as hunters, and they were barely able to
      keep the deer population under control. Tabayama has taken advantage of their
      deer problem by exporting venison to several nearby worlds.
