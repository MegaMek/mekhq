      Geifer is the site of the massive Capellan Republic Library, which was a massive facility with a wealth of knowledge. Unfortunately it suffered a great deal of damage in both the Second and Third Succession Wars. While much of the information was lost by the late Third Succession War, the remaining information was some of the most comprehensive in the settled world, primarily covering physical sciences and languages.

      The Capellan Institute of Linguistics was established on Geifer in 2978. The Institute's purely scholarly work has been hailed throughout the Inner Sphere and the political applications of its studies were invaluable to the Confederation. The Institute allowed for Confederation diplomats to be well-trained in the arts of understanding the thought processes of other cultures and the Maskirovka has easily translated several Draconis Combine dispatches that were coded in Japanese.
