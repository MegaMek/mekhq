    desc: The sleepy agro-world of Albalii was settled initially by Arabic colonists
      shortly after the first galactic wave of human expansion. Almost half of the
      planet‘s surface is taken up by three major landmasses—Omar in the southern
      hemisphere and Sadig and Euphrates in the north—but these continents have been
      carved into giant plateaus by the unusually strong currents of the surrounding
      oceans. With more than 70 percent of the coastline consisting of steep, rocky
      cliffs, and few inland lakes and rivers, Albalii‘s relatively flat inland regions
      proved a poor candidate for agricultural industry. Cities sprang up along the
      few each front areas and readily accessible rivers, while many of the desert
      plains were exploited for their modest mineral wealth. In the days of the Star
      League, the planetary government, hoping to expand the arable frontiers on Albalii,
      embarked on an ambitious plan to transfer large quantities of ocean water to
      prepared lake areas inland. Through advanced water purification technologies,
      these lakes would be used for drinking water and crop irrigation. Though local
      ecologists were outraged, the Albalii government considered the alternative—hiring
      ice ships to bring in offworld ice—far too risky and expensive. DropShips spent
      ten years moving trillions of gallons of ocean water inland, creating massive,
      man-made lakes and seas like the Great Omar Reservoir and the Tigris Sea on
      Euphrates. The result expanded Albalii‘s arable lands a thousandfold. Today,
      these new inland seas are the sites of many of this world‘s cities, including
      the large spaceport of Giza, along the northern coast of the Galilee Basin on
      Sadig, and the resort city of Saladan on the Great Omar Reservoir. Albalii‘s
      capital and first colonial settlement, Borqa, is on the eastern coast of Sadig,
      at the mouth of the Naball River.
