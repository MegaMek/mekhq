    desc: Borgan’s Rift is another of many worlds in the Periphery free-falling back
      into the dark ages. Long neglected due to the collapse of the Star League and
      the start of the Succession Wars has brought about economic ruin and technological
      decay. Off world trade has long vanished. Borgan’s Rift is now a planet ravaged
      by pirates, pillaging the few remaining markets. Many pirates inhabit the old
      industrial city of Howe. In 3049 the title to the planet was purchased by Magliss
      Spirits (a large producer of fine wines and spirits in the periphery) with the
      Magestrix’s full approval. South of Howe is the city of Newport built up by
      Shanti Magliss, owner of Magliss Spirits. Newport contains numerous warehouses
      and distribution centers.
