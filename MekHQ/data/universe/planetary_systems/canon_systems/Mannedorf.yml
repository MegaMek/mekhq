    desc: Mannedorf is a large, ice covered, planet that was part of the Draconis
      Combine for most of its history, before being conquered by Clan Ghost Bear during
      Operation Revival. The planet had a modest industrial base, which the Bears
      eventually upgraded to increase their sources of Battle Armor. Despite the extremely
      cold temperatures across most of the planet, Mannedorf is able to support enough
      agriculture around its equator to feed its population with minimal support from
      offworld.
