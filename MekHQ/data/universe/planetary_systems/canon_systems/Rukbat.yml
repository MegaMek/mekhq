    desc: 3135 - Seen from orbit, Rukbat is a wonderful expanse of endless oceans,
      tropical islands and small continents, with woodlands and green valleys aplenty.
      The majestic mountains, capped with only the slightest dusting of snow and ice,
      are treasure troves of minerals, and the seas are full of life. It therefore
      came as a surprise when the first colonists to set foot on Rukbat discovered
      their newfound paradise was thoroughly poisonous. The air, containing only slightly
      more nitrogen than Terran standard, was not a problem, but everything else,
      from the waters and soils to the native flora and fauna, was. Scientists quickly
      realized that the alien biochemistry of Rukbat‘s diverse ecosystem was completely
      incompatible with humans, creating a serious problem for the settlers. Moreover,
      this incompatibility extended to the water and soil. Though purifiers could
      help negate the more nauseating effects of Rukbat‘s freshwater table, the soil,
      saturated with the byproducts of the native life forms, could not sustain the
      colonists‘ crops. To support the mining communities that sprang up around the
      extensive mountain chains, the inhabitants of Rukbat had to import all of their
      foodstuffs and obtain a healthy number of water purifiers. Under the Terran
      Hegemony, during the height of the Star League, efforts were made to introduce
      genetically altered crops and livestock to Rukbat, but they met with only limited
      success. The altered crops, a bit more sustainable than the expensive, high-maintenance
      altered cattle, helped lessen Rukbat‘s nutritional woes, but the planet remained
      dependent on offworld meats and produce. Meanwhile, the mineral mining industry
      continued to grow, the basis for the large cities of New Glasgow and Korbensberg
      on the primary island continent of Schender Prime. During the Amaris crisis,
      the Usurper‘s troops resorted to scorched-earth tactics, destroying Rukbat‘s
      few viable farms as they retreated from the liberating SLDF troops. The fall
      of the Star League and the onset of the Succession Wars worsened the situation,
      throwing the planet‘s precarious agricultural system into ruin once again. Never
      able to recover, Rukbat remained dependent on its neighbor worlds for the basics
      of life until the rise of the Republic. Now, thanks to the relocation of several
      members of Clans Wolf and Nova Cat—and with them, their valuable scientists,
      whose experience in genetics far exceeds even that of the Star League in its
      glory days—Rukbat‘s agricultural worries may soon be over. The capital city
      of Oskart is located on Schender Minor, Rukbat‘s second largest island continent,
      located just south of Schender Prime. The planet‘s other major island continent,
      Melrin, lies mostly south of the equator and is home to the Kolivar Enclave,
      an experimental agricultural commune managed by Clan scientists in an effort
      to restore Rukbat‘s food economy.
