    desc: The first settlers to come to the mostly tropical world of Sadalbari hailed
      from the African and Middle Eastern regions of Terra. At the time, rainforests
      covered most of the world's landmasses in the middle latitudes—a paradise, compared
      to the rocky deserts and desolate grasslands these early colonists once called
      home. Hoping to establish a peaceful agrarian lifestyle, most of the first settlements
      revolved around farming and cattle ranching—processes made difficult when it
      soon became clear that most Terrestrial food crops simply wouldn‘t grow in the
      Sadalbarian soil. Native crops eventually came to the fore, becoming a significant
      export item, and one of the planet's few contributions to the rest of populated
      space, until MediTech Industries, a pharmaceutical corporation in the Star League
      era, discovered that the world's rich jungles also offered great medicinal potential.
      Under a grant from the Star League, MediTech set up an elaborate research and
      development facility on the fringe of the massive Waltabu Valley jungle. This
      facility was abandoned after the fall of the League, but eventually reclaimed
      after the First Succession War, by a local medical research company called Sadalbari
      Solutions. Today, Sadalbari Solutions operates a strong, interplanetary corporation
      that develops and sells everything from specialized dietary supplements to anticancer
      treatments. The company uses the former MediTech R and D facility as its corporate
      headquarters, based on the large, northern continent of Aberlani. Sadalbari‘s
      chief port city of Delhirahn is located on the nearby island-continent of New
      Kenya. The planetary capital, Ramolia, is situated in the Green Valley region
      on the planet's large, southern polar continent of Beth'lamel.
