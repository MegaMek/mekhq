    desc: Blackjack is mostly an arid/desert world. A tropical zone exists in the
      northern hemisphere that is almost entirely encircled by the Blackjack Ocean.
      Valuable mineral deposits and other resources are limited but easily accessible.
      Many of the planet’s heavy industries have been targets of raids by the Draconis
      Combine and Periphery bandits. Lott’s Revenge, the capital city, is located
      along the coast of the northern region. Blackjack’s population is largely made
      up of settlers of English and French descent. Blackjack is home to the Blackjack
      School of Conflict, a privately run MechWarrior Academy (later destroyed by
      the Clans).
