    desc: Roadside is a garden world, settled in 24th century by the Lyran Commonwealth
      to keep up with the produce and livestock required to feed its growing population.
      Original colonists had to overcome a microbe infestation in the water-supply,
      which caused short-term intestinal problems and was dubbed “Roadkill”. The sickness
      was a onetime discomfort and after the first time, settlers were never sick
      with it again. After study, it was discovered that the microbes actually assisted
      settlers in becoming accustomed to the planet’s indigenous plants and animals
      and had other positive effects against stomach and digestive cancers.
