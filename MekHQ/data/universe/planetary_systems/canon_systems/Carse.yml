      The Carse system has two stars - a G1V and an M1V. Due to the unique orbit around these two stars the inhabited planet (Carse IV) has an extremely varied climate depending on which of the four seasonal cycles it is currently in. As of 3025 the planet was in a cold cycle and as a result was blanketed in snow and its smallest ocean, Minor Mare, was completely frozen over.

      The planets primary industries and exports are plastics and plastisteel using the unusually large deposits of oil and other chemicals that occur naturally from the unique ecology of Carse. The cities of Carse were fortunate and came through most of the Succession Wars in relative peace. The battles and raids always stayed in the wilderness.
