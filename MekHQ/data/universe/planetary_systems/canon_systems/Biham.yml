    desc: A world of modest mineral or agricultural wealth, but rich in raw hydrocarbons,
      Biham became a haven for industrial magnates who still saw a future in petrochemical
      fuels. Coal, oil, and natural gas refineries formed the central businesses,
      around which settlements sprang up, even on the polar continent of Borellas.
      The runaway mining, drilling, and petrochemical processing rapidly devastated
      what had proven to be an extremely fragile ecosystem. By the time the planetary
      government finally stepped in to regulate the industries, the damage was so
      extreme travelers were urged to stay clear of the planet for health considerations,
      and all material shipped off-world had to undergo decontamination at special
      orbital outposts. Only Yoshimatsu Chemicals, one of the Draconis Combine‘s greatest
      chemical corporations, with its track record for rigorous safety procedures
      and strict clean-air guidelines, met the harsh restrictions suddenly imposed
      by the planetary government. Yoshimatsu today maintains the most extensive chemical
      facilities in the system, including processing centers on both moons, and even
      a space-fuel refinery over Tiberius, the smaller of the Biham system‘s gas giants.
      Apart from Borellas, Biham also has two temperate continents, Hoshina and Quang-tze.
      Siang, the planetary capital and home to Yoshimatsu Chemical‘s corporate headquarters—as
      well as a sprawling plastics and polymers plant—is located on the north shore
      of Hoshina.
