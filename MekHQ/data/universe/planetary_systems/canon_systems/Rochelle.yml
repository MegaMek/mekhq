    desc: With vast mineral resources capable of sustaining a broad industrial base,
      and further blessed by an abundant water supply and soil rich enough for planting,
      Rochelle was an easy colony world to establish and settle in the early days
      of mankind‘s race to the stars. After the fall of the Terran Alliance, this
      world became a part of the Federation of Skye, thanks to a trading alliance
      with the McQuiston family on Skye, which further boosted its economic and industrial
      growth, until its subsequent conquest by the nearby Free Worlds League. In the
      wars that followed the collapse of the original Star League, Rochelle and its
      material wealth were hotly contested, and it was particularly ravaged during
      the savagery of the First and Second Succession Wars. In fact, as the Second
      War finally ground to a halt, House Marik‘s economic experts concluded that
      the mining, refining, and manufacturing centers on Rochelle had become hopelessly
      damaged by the widespread use of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, so much
      nuclear and chemical waste had been released in the past eight decades of warfare
      that the League officially classified Rochelle as “unsalvageable” reconstruction
      efforts were soon abandoned, and the planet virtually evacuated. Despite this,
      the proud people who remained on Rochelle suffered through two centuries of
      war and death, but continued to mine valuable ore for export to industries deeper
      within the League. For a time, the world even became the headquarters of MediQuick,
      an interstellar mobile medical services corporation that offered its services
      to close to two dozen worlds on the Steiner-Marik border, until questionable
      business practices led to that company‘s demise. Despite the best efforts of
      the locals, the economy and infrastructure of this tortured and poisoned world
      continued to erode, leaving it a mere border post for League military forces
      to guard against their Lyran counterparts. During the Jihad, Lyran strike teams
      assaulted Rochelle in retaliation for renegade Free Worlds attacks, laying waste
      to the crumbling capital city of Arzenburg, on the northern continent of Caredon.
      Not until the world was ceded to Devlin Stone‘s nascent Republic would Rochelle‘s
      fortunes finally begin to turn for the better. Buoyed by an influx of new residents
      and the funds from the “peace dividend” made possible by dismantling armies,
      this world has finally begun to show signs of recovery from centuries of relentless
      warfare. The capital city, New Arzenburg, has just completed an expansion to
      its spaceport, opening up the planet to ore traffic as the mines on Caredon,
      now under the control of Rochelle Interstellar Incorporated, have begun to produce
      again. Rochelle‘s other continent, the southern landmass of Martinasia, however,
      remains largely abandoned, thanks to the high radiation and acid rains, lasting
      effects of the first two Succession Wars.
