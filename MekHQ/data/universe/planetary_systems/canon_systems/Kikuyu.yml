    desc: Kikuyu was colonized shortly after the collapse of the Terran Alliance by
      settlers from Asutralia, Tasmania and New Zealand on Earth. Kikuyu is predominantly
      a desert world with only one large continent and two large archipelagos. The
      center of the vast single Continent was a vast barren desert named the Great
      Victorian Desert, however beneath the surface of the sun-baked soil lie abundant
      deposits of rare radioactive ores and rare metals. The planetary capital, New
      Sydney, is located in the fertile Jelto Ran Delta along the southern coast of
      Queensland. Both archipelagos were set up as nation states and each have their
      own capital cities. Settlers ran into trouble on New Tasmania due to the planet’s
      own native version of the Tasmanian Devil, though at sixty-kilograms the carnivore
      proved to be even meaner than the Terran version.
