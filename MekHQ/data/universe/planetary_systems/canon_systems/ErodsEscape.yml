    desc: For most of its history Erod’s Escape has been a quiet backwater covered
      in jungles and arable lands. With the formation of the Calderon Protectorate
      in the mid 3060s, Erod’s Escape was thrust into the limelight as the de facto
      capital. This resulted in the expansion of the planetary capital Shangri-La
      expanding rapidly.
