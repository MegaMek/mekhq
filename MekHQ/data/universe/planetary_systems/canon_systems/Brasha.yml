    desc: "Brasha is an arid world covered in vast deserts and craggy mountains. Population
      centers on the planet are primarily centered around oases that dot the northern
      continent. The planet has seen a large increase in its wealth since the early
      2800s when the Outworlds Alliance created a standing army and the oil and heavy
      metals beneath the surface of Brasha became vital to the Alliance.\n\nBrasha
      is home to the unique and elite Qum’ran Guard, which are comprised of mounted
      infantry that ride six foot tall lizards called tariqim. The tariqim is a powerful
      predator and can easily reach speeds that can only be matched by light ‘Mechs
      and hovercraft. "
