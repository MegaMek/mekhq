      Oriente is the capital of the Duchy of Oriente and a key world in the Free Worlds League. While the planet is heavily industrialized its pleasant, slightly warmer than Terran, climate also allows agriculture to flourish on the temperate continents of Martigues and Navarran.

      The equatorial continents of Avillan and Tarragonan are better described as archipelagos and often suffer turbulent storms, however the residents have adapted to the month long stormy seasons and enjoy tranquil tropical weather the rest of the year.

      The remaining continent of Burgos is locked in ice and does not have any permanent settlements or habitation. Research stations and pleasure trips to explore and hike the uninhabited continent have resulted in regular, if not settled, human activity on Burgos.

      During the Succession Wars Orienteâ€™s economy was forced to switch from heavy Industry to a more service and light engineering focus, as raids and invasions destroyed much of the factories that once dominated parts of the planet.
