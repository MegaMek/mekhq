    desc: Towne is a geologically young planet with large mountains and deep oceans,
      but also features a diverse ecosphere, the epitome of which is the giant, shaggy,
      six-legged Eiglotherium. Warmer than Terra, the first colonial settlements were
      established on the northern Hyborian Continent. Abundant metallic ore deposits,
      with copper the largest by far, are found mostly in the planet‘s oceans. These
      deposits have formed the basis of Towne‘s industry, as well as a host of offshore
      mining platforms and underwater communities seeking to access these valuable
      resources. Hardwoods and cattle ranching are Towne‘s next most major industries,
      and for that reason much of the planet‘s imports have been in the form of industrial
      ‘Mechs , particularly mining, construction, and forestry ‘Mech designs. As a
      Combine-Suns border world, Towne has suffered its share of invasions during
      the Succession Wars, but despite it all, the planet retains much of its natural
      beauty. Aside from the Hyborian continent, Towne has four other landmasses,
      with Krom at the south pole, Fetryl and Gherst in the southern temperate lattitudes,
      and the island-continent of Howell in the north, several hundred kilometers
      east of Hyboria. Of these landmasses, all but Krom are sparsely populated. Gherst,
      in fact, features the planet‘s second-largest city, a water-port town called
      Kale Bay, second only to the capital city of Port Howard. Located on the Hyborian
      continent, Port Howard is also home to the Price John Spaceport, Towne‘s major
      link to the galaxy at large.
