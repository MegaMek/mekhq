      3135 - Lipton is a quiet planet of varied landscapes, lush temperate zones, and adequate resources to support low-level industry. Lipton's early settlers were a mix of western European and North American peoples who came to enjoy their frontier life and trade with neighboring worlds. Lipton achieved self-sufficiency quickly, and became a prosperous planet. The greatest planetary export is textiles, with Redstorm Fashions Incorporated among the largest single corporations invested here. The capital of Lipton City, located on the Eastern World continent, is not home to the primary spaceport on planet. The interplanetary/suborbital traffic hub of Brannigan Field is located on Suresta, Lipton‘s equatorial island-continent, which offers connecting flights to points on the Noresta, Western and Eastern World continents.

      During the Outer Reaches Rebellion, Lipton's population rebelled through passive resistance, refusing to serve as Terran Alliance troops. Lipton's self-sufficiency gave its people a sense of independence that remained with them throughout the Star League era, and as part of the Lyran Commonwealth's rebellious Skye region after the fall of the Star League. During the FedCom Civil War, many of the locals sided with the cause of Free Skye. However, the defeat of the Free Skye secessionist movement, dampened their spirit of rebellion but it was not truly called into question until the Blakist Jihad.

      The Jihad saw Word of Blake mercenaries raid the planet, smashing several industrial and strategic targets, including the military base at Estoria City, former headquarters of the Fourth Alliance Guards, on the Western World continent, and the planetary capital of Lipton City. The raids temporarily disrupted trade. An economic depression took hold that lasted until Lipton was ceded to the Republic of the Sphere. Lipton has returned to being the quiet, industrious world, though it is still regarded as something of a backwater.
