    desc: Gulkana is a relatively small planet with few natural resources. However,
      it is home to some heavy industry, which specializes in making weapons for dropships.
      The planet faced some turmoil in the early 31st century when the democratic
      local government was overthrown by the militia and the new ruler implemented
      social changes that shuffled citizens to different jobs based on their score
      on questionable IQ testing. These changes resulted in the weapons factory being
      shut down and began the talk of insurrection. The factory shutting down also
      brought notice from the highest levels of the Federated Suns government.
