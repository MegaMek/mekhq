      3135 - Basalt is a large world with an oppressively thick atmosphere, wild lightning storms, and a high gravity field. Despite these drawbacks, Basalt is rich in rare minerals and was one of the first planets settled by Terran mining companies.

      At the end of the First Star League, the Federated Suns laid claim to Basalt and held on to the world despite repeated Capellan raids through the early Succession Wars. In the Fourth Succession War, House Davion used Basalt as bait to trap several House Liao units. Today, the mountains around Lake Zander and the Contrassa spaceport, both on Basalt‘s southern continent of Garnet, are littered with the remains of Liao BattleMechs.

      The Blakist Holy War hit Basalt hard. Even during the worst of the Succession Wars, the Clan invasion, and the Federated Commonwealth Civil War, investors would bid up the price of the rare minerals produced on Basalt. The Blakists, however, hoarded Basalt‘s wealth for their own cause, impoverishing Basalt‘s families.

      During the Golden Age of Peace, Basalt‘s mining companies recovered enough to diversify into metals and other materials. A large tourist trade has been built centering around local arts and environmental travel, creating a prosperous economy. The five continents of Amethyst, Garnet, Opal, Topaz, and Quartz, are almost all situated along the equatorial region of Basalt. The capital, Manville, is located on Garnet.
