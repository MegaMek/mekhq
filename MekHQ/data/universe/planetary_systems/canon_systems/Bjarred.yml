    desc: Bjarred is a small world first settled in the 23rd Century by explorers
      from the Ozawa Merchant organization. The planet is a technologically advanced
      world with Basic Heavy Industry but Limited Industrial Output. The planet has
      little open water on its surface. What water the world possesses is underground
      running through vast catacombs. The surface vegetation and agriculture criss‐cross
      the world following the paths of these underground water ways but it leaves
      the planets with a very poor agricultural base requiring they import food. The
      world's many mountain ranges are also barren in regards to life, but are rich
      is valuable minerals and metal A prefecture capital before the Clan Invasion,
      Bjarred resumed that status after the world was reclaimed from Clan Nova Cat
      in a famous coin toss. The continent of Icefall was so named for a disastrous
      ice asteroid crash that occurred when attempting to provide comet water to early
      colonists.
