    desc: 3025 - Cate's Hold is a border world between the Magistracy and Concordat
      and was settled as a pleasure world similar to Hardcore and Canopus. Cate's
      Hold found itself thrust into the role of a major supply and repair center during
      the Reunification War before returning to a resort world during the early Succession
      Wars. The discovery of rare radioactive materials in the southern hemisphere
      and several Star League caches, have made the planet strategically important
      to the Magistracy and have resulted in several clashes between Taurian and Canopian
      forces on Cate's Hold.
