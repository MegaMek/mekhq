      3135 - First settled by the Terran Hegemony, Achernar is a self-sufficient world with a varied terrain and climate.

      The original rulers of the planet, the Achernar family, were known Davion sympathizers. Before the First Star League, they allowed the Federated Suns to stage offensives from Achernar against worlds that would later form the Capellan Confederation.

      The Achernars later established the Achernar BattleMechs company, which manufactured the Dervish BattleMech for the First Star League. During the fall of the First Star League, the Achernar family sought refuge in the Federated Suns. House Davion agreed to grant the family royal titles if they would relocate Achernar BattleMechs to the Davion capital of New Avalon. Achernar BattleMechs would go on to manufacture the unique Enforcer BattleMech for House Davion.

      House Liao claimed Achernar after the fall of the First Star League. During the Fourth Succession War, House Davion captured Achernar and restored the Achernar family to its home world for the first time in centuries. Although Achernar BattleMechs stayed on New Avalon, the family established Achernar IndustrialMechs on Achernar during the Second Star League.

      Unwilling to surrender their world a second time, the Achernar family died defending the planet during the Blakist Holy War. During the Golden Age of Peace, Achernar IndustrialMechs passed into employee ownership. The company‘s success eventually attracted the attention of industrialist Jacob Bannson and Bannson Universal Unlimited, which recently bought a controlling interest in Achernar IndustrialMechs. House Davion interests on Achernar are currently represented by the Sandoval family.

      The three continents of Achernar are Agnetenar, Eridanus, and Zaurak; the capital of River‘s End is located on Eridanus.
