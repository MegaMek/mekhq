    desc: Albiero is a nearly dead world whose natural resources are almost completely
      exhausted. Only the fact that the other worlds in the Albiero Prefecture are
      in even worse shape keeps this prefecture capital alive. Before it reached its
      current state, Albiero held vast deposits of copper and iron ore. These minerals
      led several mining concerns to arrive and exploit the resources. Unfortunately
      after the fall of the Star League the advanced mining machines weren't serviceable,
      and eventually broke down completely. The resulting loss of income depressed
      the local economy. The only group who really benefited from Albiero's state
      was the DCMS. The extensive mining operations left a labyrinth of tunnels under
      the world's surface which proved to be an excellent training facility.
