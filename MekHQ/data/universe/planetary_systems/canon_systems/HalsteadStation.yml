    desc: '3130 - The founding of Halstead Station traces back to the early days of
      human expansion, when the growing Ozawa Mercantile Association sought to ensure
      its dominion of the ―northwest region of the galaxy, through a chain of stations
      under its complete control. Unfortunately, the system chosen for one of the
      way stations lacked one small requirement: a habitable world. Because it was
      rich in minerals, particularly in the asteroid belt and on the third planet,
      a poisonous rock encased in a deadly argon-cyanide atmosphere, the system could
      not be ignored as a candidate. Engineers under the command of Geoffrey Halstead,
      one of the Association‘s more visionary directors, established Halstead Station
      in 2207 and renamed the world after their new colony. Halstead Station, more
      than merely a domed settlement on a poisonous wasteland, was actually a labyrinth
      of underground tunnels; huge surface and subsurface storehouses; and massive,
      environmentally sealed habitats that when completed, covered nearly three percent
      of the tiny planet‘s surface. When the growing Draconis Combine finally crushed
      the Ozawas, Halstead Station, as one of the Association‘s few surviving facilities,
      fell into the hands of House Kurita, which quickly assigned a significant portion
      of the ever-expanding facilities to military use. Over the centuries, Halstead
      Station has seen use as a military supply base, a maximum-security prison, and
      a place where dishonored soldiers were sent to reflect upon their mistakes.
      Though Halstead Station continued to expand as extensive mining drilled out
      more underground tunnels, the quality of life for its inhabitants gradually
      began to decline. The worst came in 3089, when a massive earthquake shook the
      entire city, rupturing its southeastern quadrant and killing thousands of residents.
      Geologists, appalled by the devastation, attributed the quake to a subterranean
      explosion that was never satisfactorily explained. When the world fell under
      the sway of Devlin Stone‘s Republic of the Sphere, the time-worn colony was
      renovated by the settlers who were relocated there. Today, Halstead Station
      remains the largest population center on the planet, though a secondary city,
      known as Stone‘s Dream, was recently founded on the far side of the Scalding
      Sea, the single large ocean that dominates much of the planet‘s southern hemisphere.'
