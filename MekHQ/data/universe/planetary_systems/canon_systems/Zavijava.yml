    desc: 3135 - Zavijava is an extremely volcanic world, so much so that high quantities
      of sulfur gas and other particulate matter blown into the atmosphere by constant
      eruptions have rendered the air difficult to breathe without filter masks, and
      prompted an ongoing exodus from the planet. The eruptions began rather suddenly
      in the twenty-fifth century, long after the first settlers made planetfall on
      this otherwise unremarkable but heretofore terrestrial world. Since then, the
      rate of eruptions has risen steadily through the years, to the point where no
      less than seven active volcanic chains spew lava and ash on a weekly basis.
      The cause for Zavijava‘s geological woes has never been adequately explained,
      and even stymied the Terran Hegemony‘s experts during the Star League era, but
      the effects have been dramatic indeed. In almost six hundred years, the worldwide
      environment changed so radically that most of the native animal species have
      gone extinct and temperatures worldwide have dropped nearly ten degrees due
      to the “nuclear winter” effects of so much ash blown into the sky. The planetary
      population, once numbering almost three billion, has also dropped steadily as
      the disturbances continue, but enough hearty souls and mining corporations have
      remained behind to try to make the most of the situation. Adding to the declining
      state of this world, of course, has been its history during the Succession Wars.
      As a Lyran-Free Worlds border planet, Zavijava has naturally been the target
      of countless raids and military campaigns in the centuries since the fall of
      the Star League. Like many other worlds in the region, it also suffered during
      the Lyran-Skye conflicts that erupted during the Jihad. In the most devastating
      of these strikes, renegade Marik troops assaulted the planetary spaceport near
      the capital city of Tzion. The resulting firefight left the capital in flames
      and cost the lives of over five thousand warriors and civilians. Unlike its
      neighbors, Zavijava did not receive reconstruction assistance after the world
      was ceded to The Republic, owing to the ongoing departure of its inhabitants
      due to the planet‘s natural crisis. Instead, a new spaceport was constructed
      near the city of Noé, on the northern continent of Peninah, which was also designated
      as the new administrative capital of Zavijava. The ruins of Tzion, now cleared
      away, stood on the southern continent, Velvel. In their place now stands a memorial
      to the fallen on both sides of the Jihad.
