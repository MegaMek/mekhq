    desc: Bremen is the capital of the Hanseatic League and houses the headquarters
      and homes of the League’s major trading families. It is also home to the central
      administration of the Council of Merchants and directs their vast trading fleets
      as well as the Regional Defense Forces. However, despite being the center of
      the Hanseatic League and coordinating trade, no trade with outsiders is authorized
      on Bremen and the planet is insulated from outside influences. Bremen is a comfortable
      garden world with abundant arable land and a comfortable atmosphere and climate.
      Beyond agriculture, the planet has few natural resources and has limited industry.
