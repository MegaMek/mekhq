      Camlann is important to the Free Worlds League after the ruling in Federal League courts that allowed the planet to become independent from the Regulus Province. Since then hundreds of planets in the League have declared themselves independent and have greatly affected political importance of some regions.

      Camlann itself is barely able to sustain itself, the primarily industry and exports from Camlann are communications gear and components. Most of Camlann has been terraformed and over the years the planet has become comfortable for human life. The planet is known for its several unique dinosaur like species.
