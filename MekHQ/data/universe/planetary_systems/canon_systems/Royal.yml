    desc: Royal is a comfortable garden world with an abundance of natural resources
      and has spent most of its history as a fiercly contested battleground between
      the Federated Suns and the Draconis Combine. Despite the excellent habitable
      conditions and abundant resources, the constant raids and multiple invasions
      have crippled technology and industry on the planet before it can ever get deeply
      established. Royal was the focal point during the Second Hidden War during the
      Star League and the brutal fighting on Royal saw First Prince Joseph Davion
      personally take charge of the Federated Suns forces on planet until his Marauder
      was disabled and he was pulled from the cockpit by Combine infantry, forced
      to kneel and then beheaded. The loss of the First Prince left the Federated
      Suns forces in disarray and they were quickly forced from the planet, which
      remained in Combine hands until the Star League settled the dispute.
