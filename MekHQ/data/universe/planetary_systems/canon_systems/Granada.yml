      Granada is a resource and agriculturally poor world, which relies on imported food and goods to survive. While the climate and atmosphere of Granada are relatively comfortable, the soil and native plant life are incompatible with terran crops and human biology respectively, making agriculture very difficult. Granada is important because it is home to some of the limited manufacturing and refit facilities in the deep Periphery. The military industry on Granada is primarily centered on the Pasadena continent. Pride of Granada Industries, which produces primitive and more modern BattleMechs, is located in the plains outside of Temple City. The Alphambra Refit station, which repairs and refits BattleMechs has been a long standing facility on Granada and is located in mountainous Alhambra Cit. Caliphate Airfield Alpha, which produces aerospace fighters and combat vehicles, is located on the Victory Plains. The planetary capital is the coastal city Arcadia, located on Pasadena.
