      Originally colonized in the early 2400s, Kobe was transformed into a beautiful tourist attraction full of flora, fauna and wildlife brought together from across the universe by the height of the Star League and was a popular tourist attraction. Unfortunately around the time of the fall of the Star League the planet’s volcanoes and seismic plates became extremely active. Of the five heavily populated continents during the Star League, Kobe had only two continents suitable for human living by the early 31st century.

      The massive volcanic eruptions quickly changed the planet’s climate from tropical to subarctic as the ash blocked the sun. The planet continued to subside as a producer of electronics and chemical engines, however the continued formation of more volcanoes leaves the planet’s continued habitation in question.
