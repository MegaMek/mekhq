    desc: Pesht was discovered by early explorers from the Ozawan Merchant Clan in
      2212. The Ozawan Clan made multiple attempts over the course of several decades
      to settle the forest covered planet, however, the world's native ape predators
      interferred with these efforts. The Clan was eventually forced to relinquish
      the planet to the Draconis Combine. It wasn't until 2320 world was finally settled
      but only after the Combine "discovered" the ape-like creatures for themselves.
      After losing an entire settlement did efforts go into nearly exterminating the
      beast before Pesht was habitable. After clearing the predators, Combine's true
      intentions for colonizing Pesht were revealed. The planet became a military
      colony used by the Combine as a launch pad to conqueror neraby worlds. From
      Pesht, DCMS forces were able to launch military engagements into the Draconis
      Rift region. Eventually Pesht became the capital of its own military district
      after Coordinator Martin McAllister implented his restructuring of the Combine's
      governmental system. The majority of military forces that had been stationed
      on Pesht when it was originally a staging base were moved to defend the Combine's
      new capital of Luthien in mid 27th Century. The University of Pesht in Danube
      is known for its impressive graduate studies, especially in history.
