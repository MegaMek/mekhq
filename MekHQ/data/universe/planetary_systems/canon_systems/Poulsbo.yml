      Poulsbo lies on the anti-spinward edge of Lyran space, along the border shared with the Free Worlds League. Poulsbo is a tropical planet, mostly covered in vast oceans and seas. Due to a single large moon in orbit of the planet, Poulsbo’s waterways are rough and treacherous.

      Though discovered in the late 2300s, Poulsbo was passed over for colonization, due to its lack of important natural resources and the difficulty in harnessing the aquatic life for food due to the dangerously churning waters. Later, with the rise of the Houses within the Inner Sphere, Poulsbo was colonized by the Lyran’s due to its key strategic position along House Marik’s border.

      With the formation of the Star League, and the peace it brought, Poulsbo was once again forgotten by the powers-that-be, though a large number of colonists remained on the isolated planet. These colonists became understandably upset when the outbreak of the Succession wars once again brought the Lyran military and raiders from the Free Worlds League and Periphery to their doorstep.

      Poulsbo remains a lightly settled Military Outpost, whose civilian population is mostly upset by constant Lyran politics and war.
