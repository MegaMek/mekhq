      Despite an impressive ring of ice and dust replacing what might pass for a moon for more ordinary planets, Dromini IV does not look like much from orbit. Indeed, this world seems to be half shrouded in swirling gray clouds at any given time, a sign of the turbulent storm systems that constantly play about its surface. With only modest raw-material and fossil fuel resources to exploit, the local manufacturers and businesses never produced anything on Dromini that could not be found on dozens of other nearby planets, nor has the world held any great strategic significance. Nonetheless, this small industrial planet‘s location on the Combine/Lyran border made it a favored staging ground during the centuries of war following the original Star League‘s demise.

      Houses Kurita and Steiner clashed over Dromini in a number of historic campaigns, the most spectacular of which was the Wolf‘s Dragoons‘ assault in 3021, which helped break the back of a planned Combine invasion into the Lyran Commonwealth‘s Skye Province. Each round of fighting, and change of allegiance, damaged the local economy and infrastructure, but the victors often repaired what they could before the planet changed hands again. This constant shifting gave the people of Dromini IV something of an identity crisis, with portions of German- and Scottish-speaking Lyran nationals mingling—and often clashing—with Japanese-influenced Combine citizens. Still, even as fighting raged around them, more of these people managed to coexist peacefully than did not, and it was this situation and others like it on border worlds throughout the region that helped to inspire Devlin Stone‘s relocation directives after the formation of the Republic of the Sphere.

      In the 32nd century, Dromini is home to people descended originally from Davion, Steiner, Kurita, Marik, and even Clan heritage, creating a cosmopolitan society that once served as a model to others throughout The Republic. This mixture has also provided an excellent venue from which to conduct trade with the neighboring Successor States. Much of this trade is handled through Franchelco, the planetary capital city on the northern continent of Vijave, but major shipping ports and commercial centers exist on all three of Dromini IV‘s other continents, Kodersia, Epoure, and Apokayik.
