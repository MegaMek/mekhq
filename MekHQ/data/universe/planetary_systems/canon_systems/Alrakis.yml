    desc: Alrakis is a comfortable temperate planet with large deposits of metal ores
      in the mountain ranges that cross the planet’s continents and three of the planet’s
      largest moons. Thanks to the massive deposits of raw materials numerous factories
      were constructed and many survived through the Succession Wars, thanks primarily
      to an avoidance of heavy military industry. For much of its history Alrakis
      was a hotly contested industrial world with the Lyran Commonwealth and Draconis
      Combine vying for control. While the planet’s climate is comfortable and there
      is sufficient fertile land and large deposits of natural resources, initial
      settlement was slow due to the high gravity on planet and the danger of the
      native tigerfalcon. A large avian predator which was known to attack in packs
      of three to five. By the time of the Star League the tigerfalcon population
      had been reduced to levels that allowed for further safe inhabitation of Alrakis.
