      Illiushin is a comfortable planet with vast grassy plains and fields that make it ideal for agriculture and the planet is renowned for its large and varied cheese industry. Due to its popularity, there is a silent ‘hands-off’ agreement among pirates in the area regarding the cheese production on planet. One pirate band found itself hunted down by other pirates after their raid haulted production for several weeks. Illiushin is also home to a sizable manufacturing base in the form of Vandenberg Mechanized Industries, which has facilities on Illiushin that produce BattleMechs, DropShips, small craft, as well as weaponry and other combat equipment. The planet is also home to the Illiushin Taurian Academy where armor crews and infantry are trained.
