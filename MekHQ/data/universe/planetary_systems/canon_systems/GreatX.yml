    desc: Great X has two continents, Eades and Bastion, with the majority of the
      population on the Eades. Eades is also home to the capital city of Spot which
      sits across the estuary of the Galahad River. The Shipping Port of Treasure
      Bay is the largest shipping port on Great X. The port, sitting on the estuary
      of the Galahad River and the Ocean of Storms, provides a fair percentage of
      Spot’s internal income. Twenty-five kilometers east of the capital, Spots starport,
      as well as its garrison and bivouac facilities, are connected by several heavy
      rail lines and an interstate highway. These facilities and Spot are very defensible
      from the western approaches of the Wicker Mountains. Great X spent most of its
      existence as a stopover for Lyran troops on their way to the Draconis Combine
      front. Following the Clan Invasion the Exes (as the inhabitants call themselves)
      were surprised to find themselves near a front line. This proximity to the Clan
      Front as turned Great X into a fortified depot system. Bastion continent has
      received most of this effort, with several new shipping hubs being built to
      support troops heading to the front.
