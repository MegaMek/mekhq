      3135 - Gacrux, is a world in a state of decline, cooling as the warmth of its star, a red giant in its final years, fades with each passing century. Colonists were drawn to Gacrux by its abundance of precious metals, industrial ores, and radioactive materials, establishing several mining and manufacturing operations. Most of these settlements were established on the shores of Praddis and Umberholdt, the planet's two large, landlocked, freshwater oceans. Fort Habersburg, the capital city, is located on the southern coast of Praddis. Gacrux prospered as an industrial world but lacked sufficient resources to feed a booming population.

      Gacrux became a member of the Federation of Skye and then the Lyran Commonwealth. Gacrux was the target for many raids over the years due to its proximity to the Free World League. Thus the people of Gacrux eagerly embraced the union of the Federation of Skye into the Lyran Commonwealth, showed remarkable loyalty to the Commonwealth and were among the few Skye worlds not opposed to Steiner rule during the Skye region's rebellious years. The Gacrux people's sense of nationalism evolved into a kind of xenophobia, with protests against the Commonwealth's alliance with the Federated Suns and the militia forces constantly lobbied for military action against the Free Worlds League. This attitude made Gacrux one of the strongholds of the Brotherhood of Cincinnatus, a Lyran veterans association turned supremacist movement.

      During the Jihad, Free World League forces, duped by the Word of Blake, attacked Gacrux and destroyed the local militia along with the industrial cities of Rawlins and Morgan Junction, savaging the heart of Gacrux's industrial and administrative infrastructure and throwing the planet into chaos. Lyran troops, as part of Devlin Stone‘s coalition, finally restored order.

      At the dawn the thirty-second century, a surgical strike from the Lyran Commonwealth apparently destroyed the secret Brotherhood of Cincinnatus base on planet. Devlin Stone‘s relocation programs and efforts to rebuild the cities and complexes destroyed during the Jihad, have made Gacrux a thriving member of The Republic of the Sphere.
