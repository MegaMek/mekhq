      Discovered in 2205 by the aptly named TAS Camelot, this lush planet quickly attracted colonists. Meanwhile, the native life was genetically altered to yield more Terran-like foodstuffs. New Avalon grew to become the breadbasket for worlds around it. This important role assisted Lucien Davion's rise to power and eventually resulted in the Davion family ruling the Federated Suns from this agricultural world and the planet is one of the core "Golden Five" worlds in the Federated Suns.

      New Avalon boasts five continents. Albion is the largest, with prairies and forests interspersed between its mountain ranges. Brunswick is next in line, boasting most of the planet's petrochemical production and heavy industry, along with two major spaceports. Rostock is primarily a ranching continent, though some land is lost to the planet's only significant desert. Up north, the smallest continent, New Scotland, is covered with snow most of the year. New Scotland’s primary export has historically been raw materials, specifically hard woods, metals and rare furs to supply the other continents. The New Hebrides island chain is located near the equator, making it a prime location for citrus crops and vacation resorts.

      Located in the center of three rivers is Avalon City, home of the ruling Davion family. Originally constructed as a medieval theme park, the Davions continued to use the romantic side of medieval imagery to bolster morale and rule from atop Mt. Davion to the east of Avalon City.

      The terrain surrounding Avalon City is a mixture of forests, mountains, plains and population centers. The New Avalon Institute of Science combines a top-of-the-line university, research and development center, and one of the Inner Sphere’s premier military school. Hidden in the surrounding forests are advanced weapon study facilities as well as a hardened command-and-control complex deep in Mount Davion. Large natural boundaries separate civilian nature preserves from testing areas.
