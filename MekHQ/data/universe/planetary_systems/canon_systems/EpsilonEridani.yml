    desc: 3135 - Epsilon Eridani is a pleasant world, if a bit damp. Frequent, but
      usually mild, rainstorms and fertile soils have transformed the southern continent
      of Gousha into a mix of swamplands and rainforest, yet much of the planet‘s
      industry, including Kressly Technologies (formerly Kressly Warworks), is based
      there. The northern continent of Parassus, by contrast, is drier and rockier,
      though hardly spared the effects of the planet‘s chronic showers. The major
      trading and port city of Dori sits by the large Lake Arous on Parassus, and
      is the center of the planet‘s commercial industry. Just 370 kilometers northwest
      of Dori is the planetary capital, Madison, rebuilt after the Amaris occupation,
      when the city—including a Star League mint that printed Capellan currencies—was
      virtually leveled by an orbital bombardment. Today, the largest of Epsilon Eridani‘s
      corporations is Kressly Technologies, whose facilities on the planet include
      an IndustrialMech manufacturing facility and an aerospace plant in the Goushan
      Highlands. The Kressly aerospace plant is actually a recent addition, built
      from the remains of a forgotten surface testing facility that once belonged
      to the long-destroyed Harvard Company. Harvard, which produced aerospace fighters
      in the days of the Star League, survived the League‘s destruction only to fall
      in the crossfire between Houses Liao and Davion during the First Succession
      War.
