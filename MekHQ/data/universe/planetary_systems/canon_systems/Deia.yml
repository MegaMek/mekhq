      Deia is a harsh planet deep in the Lyran interior, which protected it from the worst of the Succession Wars. Many of the original settlers died from the planet’s harsh conditions, with most of the survivors being Deists, allowing them to shape the planet over the following centuries. The population of Deia managed to eek out enough agriculture to feed the planet’s small population and mining of Deia’s abundant natural resources is the primary industry.

      After the Clan Invasion, Deia found itself along the front of a new dangerous border and as a result saw a sudden influx of regular and mercenary forces to garrison the previously quiet backwater. Deia was one of a handful of planets targeted by the Red Corsair in the early 3050s.
