      Solaris VII is best known as the Game World. Since the time of the Star League the planet has been host to 'Mech duels. The planet is part of the Lyran Commonwealth but it is home to an enclave from each of the major Inner Sphere powers and the best selling games are usually between Stables that support rivaling Great Houses.

      Solaris VII has two continents, Equatus is small, arid, mountainous and sparsely populated. Greyland is a large continent which varies from arctic taiga to the north to warm grassy plains to the south and a large coniferus forest to the center of the continent. Greyland is home to the capital and site of the Games, Solaris City. The City is in the centeral part of the continent and subject to near constant clouds and rain.
