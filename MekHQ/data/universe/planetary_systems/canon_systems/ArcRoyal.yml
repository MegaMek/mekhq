      Arc-Royal is a pleasant world with a mild climate and mild weather. While the planet is highly developed and industrialized, these efforts were confined to certain areas and as a result Arc-Royal’s wilderness is largely untouched. The Arc-Royal MechWorks BattleMech facility is located in the city of New Hannover in the rolling hills of the Gutheim continent. ComTech manufacturing was built in the 3070s as a joint venture between ComStar, the Lyran Alliance and the Kell family. While most of the plant's output goes to ComStar, most of the profits go to the Alliance and the Kells. The plant is located around the volcanic Mount Zugspitze on the Gerechtland continent. Finally there are the Kell Refit Facilities, also located in New Hannover, which began as simple refit facilities but expanded to manufacturing with support from the Wolf's Dragoons.

      In the mid-late 31st Century, Arc-Royal was home to the Kell Hounds and Clan Wolf-in-Exile. The presence of the Kell Hounds resulted in Arc-Royal becoming a mercenary hiring hall, which became more prominent with the destruction of Outreach during the Jihad and the later attacks on Galatea by Word of Blake. Clan Wolf has greatly expanded manufacturing on Arc-Royal. The Wolves built the Lupis Majoris naval refit and repir yard in orbit, the facility is believed to be capable of building JumpShips and even WarShips, however a lack of knowledge and material have so far limited the yards to repairs and refits. WC Aerospace Annex creates OmniFighters for Clan Wolf-in-Exile and is located in the town of Knucklehead on the flatlands of the Gutheim continent. WC Auxiliary Factory Epsilon produces conventional armor for the Wolves and is located in the town of Pinkston on flatlands of the Gutheim continent. WC Sites 1-3 create BattleMechs and Elemental battle armor and are all located in the city of Crashtest in the badlands of Gutheim. WC Site 4 is located in the city of Crackerjack on the flatlands of Gutheim and produces conventional armor for Clan Wolf-in-Exile. Finally, the Gurngurtel Jungle on the Gutheim continent is home to Solitude, the main Wolf-in-Exile training facility.
