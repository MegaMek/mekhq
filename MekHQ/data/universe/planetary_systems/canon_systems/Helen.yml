    desc: A lush tropical world settled by predominantly Greek colonists, Helen‘s
      great claim to fame has been its remarkably beautiful and extremely diverse
      undersea wildlife. Though land covers just over half the planet surface, broken
      into eleven large island-continents and numerous smaller islands, Helen‘s oceans
      are surprisingly deep, giving rise to a wide variety of sea life, including
      the Great Helenic Whale. This nonmammalian shark-like predator can grow to approximately
      four times the size of Terra‘s Great White, and dominates the waters of Helen‘s
      southern hemisphere. In the days of the Star League, a sophisticated floating
      marine-life research platform dubbed Aquanis once studied the rich undersea
      wildlife of this world, but was sunk during the invasions brought on after the
      fall of the Star League. Rediscovered almost three kilometers below the surface
      of the North Helenic Ocean, off the coast of the Persephonie continent, this
      sunken city has become one of Helen‘s major tourist attractions. The planetary
      capital of Konstance is located on Joppa, the largest of Helen‘s continents,
      along with the bulk of the planet‘s lumber industries, the spaceport city of
      Corinth, and the military capital of Montague.
