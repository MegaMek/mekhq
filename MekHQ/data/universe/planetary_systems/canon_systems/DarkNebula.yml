    desc: The Dark Nebula Waystation was created as a logistical point for the invading
      Clans just outside of the Inner Sphere and has traded hands multiple times between
      the 3050s and 3070s, with multiple attempts made to destroy the station outright.
      However, the immense size of the station prevented its complete destruction,
      but eventually all functions beyond using the Dark Nebula as a stopover and
      possibly storage, were lost.
