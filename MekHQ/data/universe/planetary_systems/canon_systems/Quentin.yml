    desc: A world of abundant raw materials, the first settlers to Quentin were actually
      employees of Terran corporations hoping to exploit such valuable resources for
      their ambitious ventures. During the Age of War, many of these industries turned
      to military applications, and the planet‘s economy truly thrived, but with such
      prosperity came the desire by various neighboring governments to secure Quentin
      and its industries for themselves. Only the rise of the Star League saved Quentin
      from the worst ravages of war. The League‘s dominion, which included Quentin,
      brought even more wealth to the world when they established a major BattleMech
      manufacturing plant in the densely industrialized Steel Valley region. This
      factory ultimately became the centerpiece for Independence Weaponry in the centuries
      after the League‘s collapse, and, in its heyday, produced scores of heavy and
      assault BattleMech designs—including the JagerMech, Victor, and Atlas. Immediately
      after the collapse of the League, however, forces from the Draconis Combine,
      Capellan Confederation, and the Federated Suns fought bitterly for control of
      this important world. The planet still retains the scars of that fighting in
      the form of its caustic atmosphere—the result of a massive biological-weapon
      attack, launched against the world by retreating would-be conquerors in the
      First Succession War. The majority of the planet‘s population today resides
      in and around Steel Valley, on the equatorial continent of Morandi, which is
      also home to the planetary capital of Prosperity Point. The other planetary
      continents, El Largo in the northern hemisphere, Gladius in the south, and El
      Minoro in the southern polar region, are far less populous, due to the extreme
      cold temperatures in those regions, and the gradual decline of these outlying
      areas during the last few centuries of war.
