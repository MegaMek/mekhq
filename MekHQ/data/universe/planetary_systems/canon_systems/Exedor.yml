      Exedor was settled in the mid-29th century and was used to house secret personal treasures of House Liao in underground facilities, with veteran defenders.

      As of 3025 Exedor had a tiny population, consisting primarily of refugees from the Third Succession War. The planet subsided on businesses servicing the planetâ€™s garrison forces. Rumours indicate that the population includes a disproportionate number of intelligence agents suggesting that Exedor may also double as a data analysis and covert operation planning centre. There are also unsubstantiated rumours of a secret underground population engaged in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.

      3085: During the 4th Succession War and the Word of Blake Jihad, the population of Exedor surged with refugees hoping the limited military importance of Exedor would keep them safe. Unfortunately with the population living underground and limited industry, the planet's living conditions quickly deteriorated due to overcrowding and unrest. In response the government of Exedor authorized a massive expansion of the underground tunnel system, which put people to work and began to relieve the overcrowding.

      Exedor is home to one of the many Duchy RTC training facilities throughout the Capellan Confederation that train infantry and conventional armor crews.
