    desc: Circe’s orbit follows a 700 year cycle that takes it from one extreme in
      the system’s life zone (the zone in which liquid water can exist) to the other.
      In the 29th century the planet was a desert wasteland, whereas by the 32nd century
      it is expected to be covered by glaciers and sheet ice. Early settlers found
      that while the air was free of serious contaminants, the soil contained a variety
      of toxins.
