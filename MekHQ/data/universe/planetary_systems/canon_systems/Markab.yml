    desc: 3135 - One of the first worlds settled by the Azami, a fanatical Muslim
      culture originating in the northern region of Terra‘s Africa continent, known
      for its fierce and dedicated warriors. Much of Markab strongly resembles the
      native lands of these proud people. The surface land of Markab is concentrated
      mostly in a single, giant supercontinent known as Al-Qoradana, which has few
      inland rivers or bodies of water of any sort. A few islands of various sizes
      pepper the oceans surrounding this great landmass, but it is on Al-Qoradana
      that the settlers established the majority of their cities. These early colonists,
      drawn by the hidden wealth of precious metals and hydrocarbons beneath the windswept
      surface of sand, rocks, and precious few oases, carved their niche into the
      world despite a harmful bacteriological taint in the atmosphere. Resourceful,
      the Azami learned to overcome the ravages of the world‘s environment, and the
      planet flourished despite a campaign by the forces of the Draconis Combine to
      undercut their culture and independence. As a result of the Combine attacks,
      however, most of the Azami‘s water-purification plants were destroyed, and those
      that survived malfunctioned over time. Only in the last century or so, with
      the rediscovery of lost technologies, have the inhabitants of Markab been able
      to restore the lost ability to drink their own world‘s abundant seawater and
      use it for irrigation.
