      For most of its history Twycross was the capital of the Trellshire Province in the Lyran Commonwealth’s Tamar Pact. The planet itself has an unusually high occurance of typhoons, tornadoes and other extreme weather which require most of the population to live underground. The majority of above-ground buildings are never tall and must be built extremely well to survive the harsh climate. Twycross is home to Trellshire Industries’ BattleMech plant.

      The system is most famous for being the site Federated Commonwealth’s first victory of Clan Jade Falcon in a raid on October of 3050.

      The system also later gained value when the uninhabited planet, Jonah’s Reach, was found to be the first known planet in the Inner Sphere with deposits of the material the Clans use to make Harjel.
