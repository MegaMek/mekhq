    desc: 3135 - Once a beautiful, temperate trading world for the Draconis Combine
      and Free Worlds League, and famed for the curious crystalline rock formations
      in the desert canyons of its main continent of Balerdo, Asta was mutilated by
      the guns of Blakist WarShips during the Jihad. Lacking much in the way of heavy
      industry, Asta had been primarily an agricultural world, with prime exports
      limited to foodstuffs, textiles, and civilian commercial vehicles. During the
      Jihad, however, the planet‘s position, just a single jump from Terra, and the
      presence of a small Combine unit, mandated that it be attacked by the Word of
      Blake in an effort to establish a buffer zone around Terra. A sustained barrage
      from the Blake WarShips all but destroyed the planetary capital of Excaliba,
      and the Blakists placed a number of their “reeducation camps” on the planet
      along with their occupation forces. The fight to eject the fanatics devastated
      more of the planetary surface and economy, but Devlin Stone‘s efforts to revitalize
      Asta have gradually begun to bear fruit. Today, Asta is once more a trading
      world, with vessels regularly entering and departing the new capital and port
      city of Logan, on the northwestern supercontinent, Balerdo. Charbyllis, the
      largest population center on the smaller southern continent of Moolai, still
      remains home to the majority of Asta‘s textile industries, with farmlands dominating
      the open plains north and east of the city proper. The Desert Ice Fields of
      Balerdo Grande, still a popular tourist site on Asta, now also include the planet‘s
      memorial to those killed in the Jihad, a solemn reminder of the dark days before
      The Republic.
