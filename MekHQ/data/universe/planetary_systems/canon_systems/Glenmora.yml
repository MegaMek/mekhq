      3028 - Glenmora is a water-rich world covered in oceans. The only continent sized landmass is Hades, which is famous for its vast volcanic fields. Unfortunately the regular eruptions from the many volcanoes that created the continent cause ash to create thick clouds that often block out the sun nearly year round. Despite this, seventy percent of the planet’s population live on Hades and endure the ever present overcast skies. The remaining thirty percent of the planet’s population reside on the multitude of large islands that dot Glemora’s oceans.

      Tronka is the largest city on Glenmora as well as the planetary capital. The planet’s chemical factories produce most of the exports, though the seabeds around the large islands of Davison and Carson have small deposits of extremely rare minerals that make up for the limited natural resources of Glenmora by being in such high demand.

      Glenmora’s location on the Federated Suns and Draconis Combine border has made the planet a target for multiple raids and several invasions throughout the centuries. As a result the planet has always maintained a large militia, which supports the standard infantry and mechanized infantry regiments with several heavy tank regiments.
