      Hachiman is a rare planet in that it has comfortable living conditions and is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, two attributes that have made the planet attractive to both settlers and corporations. As of the 31st century Hachiman was the center of the Draconis Combine’s computer and advanced electronics industry as the headquarters of Hachiman Taro Electronics and Tanadi Computers, which makes its home in the planetary capital of Masamori.

      The planetary capital of Masamori is located on the continent of Ōjin. The planet has three other continents. Deolali is dominated by ancient forests and deep river canyons. Jingū is to the far north and is covered in virgin snowfields and home to the rare Bodhisattva violet, which is prized for its beauty and natural perfume. The final continent of Nashik is dominated by varied tropical terrains and host to annual DCMS war games and secretive ISF training operations. Nashik is also home to small, scattered Buddhist and Hindu villages, remainders of the planet’s Gujarati and Mahratta founding colonies. Hachiman is the last world to contain genetic relatives to refugees from the United Hindu Collective.
