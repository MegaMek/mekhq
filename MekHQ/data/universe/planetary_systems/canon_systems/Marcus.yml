      3135 - Marcus is a heavy world with an oppressive atmosphere and mountains squashed into rolling hills. However, Marcus was an irresistible colonisation target in the early days of exploration, due to its abundance of radioactive and industrial mineral resources. The city of Zotikos stands again on the northern continent of Montezumia, and is host to the planet's primary spaceport.

      Originally part of the Terran Hegemony, Marcus' industries boomed and the planet even became the site for Orguss Industries, a prominent Star League-era BattleMech manufacturer. After the fall of the Star League, the Free Worlds League claimed it, but as an industrial border world, Marcus became the target for raids and invasions launched by the Lyran Commonwealth. The Orguss plants and many of the supporting industries were left devastated by centuries of raids and invasion attempts. During the Fourth Succession War, Marcus became a protectorate of the Federated Commonwealth, but was reclaimed by the Free World League during the invasion of 3057, after a particularly brutal battle.

      The Word of Blake Jihad initially overlooked the planet, but later in the Jihad, Word of Blake troops, hoping to cut off a coalition counteroffensive, smashed the planetary capital of Zotikos and fought a fierce, but doomed, battle for control of the Wahryn uranium mines. Zotikos was subsequently rebuilt after the end of the Jihad.
