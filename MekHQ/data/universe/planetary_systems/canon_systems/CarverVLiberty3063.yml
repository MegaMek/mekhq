    desc: 3135 Settled by self-styled pilgrims from the poorest nations in the African
      and South American continents on Terra, everything about Carver V seemed a divine
      blessing compared to the homes they left behind. Large, deep oceans, crystal-clear
      lakes, fertile lands and lush, mostly tropical forests, with few desert regions
      and rich veins of ore and mineral deposits all awaited the early settlers who
      didn‘t mind the occasional storm. The planetary capital city of Bellacqu was
      established on the planet‘s largest island, which the early settlers dubbed
      Quantico, in the northern Quantico island chain. Just a few short years later,
      two more large settlements were chartered and established on Carver V. Binsburg,
      a major mining colony, arose on the eastern edge of Esperanza, largest of the
      southern Drasken Chain, and New Cairo, based around the Crocales-hunting and
      ranching industries, appeared on the equatorial Kalimbawe Chain, just a few
      short years later. These new settlements sparked a renewed interest in the creation
      of a planet-wide wet navy to keep the scattered communities connected, and by
      the time of the Star League, the seas of the planetary Infinto Ocean were busy
      with the traffic of thousands of merchant marine vessels. Less to protect the
      planet‘s modest mineral mines and Crocales-hide fashion industries than to defend
      against Capellan encroachment, the SLDF built the Quantico Marine Fortification—an
      elaborate alternative to the standard Castle Brian—around Quantico and its neighboring
      Parris Island. This massive fortification, surrounding the islands with a series
      of weapon towers and underground tunnels, protected Bellacqu, as well as the
      major spaceports of El Toro and Baku, and several fortified submarine and surface
      ship bases. In the darkest days of the Amaris coup, three SLDF marine regiments
      stationed on Carver V successfully held out against the Usurper‘s troops for
      six long years before Kerensky‘s liberating forces could rescue them. Their
      valiant defense, as well as Carver V‘s lack of significant resources, and the
      difficulty in waging large-scale warfare on the island-speckled planet spared
      the world much of the damage inflicted on its neighbors by the coup. During
      the centuries under Capellan rule Carver V became a vacation spot for wealthy
      Confederation citizens, the empty towers of the abandoned Quantico Marine Fortification
      recognized as a tourist attraction. Captured by the Federated Commonwealth after
      the Fourth Succession War, Carver V experienced a major upheaval when the Commonwealth
      fractured in 3057. Torn by fighting between the Capellan Confederation, Federated
      Suns, Lyran Alliance, Free Worlds League, and even the Word of Blake, only the
      spirit of the planet‘s citizens allowed the world to recover when the shooting
      finally stopped. Carver V was renamed Liberty by a popular movement to unify
      the world that rose during this terrible crucible, and the name was ratified
      formally after the Jihad, when the world was accepted into The Republic. Since
      then, Liberty has once more become a paradise to visitors and natives alike.
