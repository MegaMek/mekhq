      Settled in the 23rd century, New Ivaarsen was colonized by Nordic explorers searching for a terran-like planet comfortable for human life. New Ivaarsen was pretty close, though it always came up lacking when compared to other gems of the Inner Sphere like New Avalon and Tikonov. However, these comparisons are likely what drove the planet to become so technologically and industrially advanced.

      New Ivaarsen has diverse terrain over 6 continents and seven oceans, as well as an underground freshwater sea. The planet boasts large tracts of arable land, more than capable of feeding the large city-dwelling populations. The planet also boasts an abundance of natural resources to fuel its large industrial base. The planet is also well known for fine universities and educational systems, New Ivaarsen boasts the second highest literacy rate in the entire Inner Sphere, behind only Terra. The planet is also known for its contributions to architecture and the arts.

      Due to all this, New Ivaarsen is a vital world in the Federated Suns. Additionally, from a military perspective the planet is of vital strategic importance to the defense of both Robinson and New Avalon. New Ivaarsen was captured during the early Succession Wars and was not recaptured by the Federated Suns until the mid 29th Century.
