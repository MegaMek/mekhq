      The original colonists of Neerabup were originally part of the settlers that founded the planet Australia, however the Neerabup colonists wanted to settle further from Terra, and after several near-fights broke out between the opposing groups, the soon-to-be Neerabup colonists managed to take control of two JumpShips and continue beyond Australia. Several weeks later they arrived at Neerabup with dwindling food supplies.

      Neerabup had a comfortable climate and a wide variety of terrain, predominantly lush swamps and peat bogs, which offered a wide variety of edible plant-life, there was next to no edible animal-life and as a result the settlers adopted a primarily vegetarian diet, at least until another passing group of settlers agreed to trade some of their livestock.

      Neerabup remained a quiet backwater for most of its history, the planet supports enough agriculture to feed its population, though the swamp lands do not lend themselves to Neerabup becoming a breadbasket, and the planet’s lack of abundant minerals or oil kept any heavy mining or industry from developing. However, in 3042 the Federated Commonwealth, in an effort to improve the military in the Lyran half of the Commonwealth, selected Neerabup as the location for a regional militia HQ. The creation of the new regional HQ brought an economic boom to Neerabup with the influx of high tech goods and a need for locally produced raw materials and imports.

      Neerabup is divided into provinces that are each ruled by a Publican. The Publican title is hereditary and must be given to the firstborn male son of the family. However, when there is no male heir the province elects a new Publican who can be male or female.
