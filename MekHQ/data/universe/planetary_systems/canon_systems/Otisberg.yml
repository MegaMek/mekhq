      Otisberg is a comfortable, if cool, temperate planet dotted with numerous volcanoes that provide fertile soil to the veritable garden world but also make agriculture a gambit when they erupt every several years. During the Star League, Otisberg was home to multiple factories, which did not make it through the Succession Wars. However, when the Rim Collection formed in the 3050s, the tiny realm began to fund the excavation of the old ruins and surprisingly several of the manufacturing lines were found to be in repairable condition. The recovered lines had been producing primitive BattleMechs for the Collection for many years by 3080. Rim Motors is located outside of the town of Amariston on the Salvation continent. The planetary militia is headquartered in the mountain town of Illiana on the Ashland continent.
