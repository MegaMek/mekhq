      Keystone was never a comfortable world to live on and centuries of heavy industrial output have not improved the planet’s livability. The planet was originally settled to take advantage of large deposits of raw metals and a large number of heavy industries were built up to make use of the minerals mined from the planet. While the mineral deposits have since dried up, the factories remain and Keystone continued to be an industrial powerhouse in the Free Worlds League.

      Due to the low pressure (and tainted) atmosphere of Keystone, rebreathing devices are a common sight outdoors and most buildings have built-in air scrubbers to provide a comfortable living environment. Many buildings also use some form of pressurization to bring pressure levels to near-Terran. All food on planet must be grown in hydroponic greenhouses due to the toxicity of the planet’s soil, while the facilities are supposed to allow Keystone to be self-sufficient, in practice the planet relies on imported foodstuffs.
