    desc: Kesai IV is a desert planet with almost no water and no native life. The
      planet also has few natural resources and almost nothing to lend itself to human
      habitation. Originally settled to mine radioactive elements, many of the settlers
      left when it was discovered the deposits were smaller than expected. The planet
      also found use as a prison planet for convicts by first the Draconis Combine
      and then later the Federated Suns. However, during the Star League, the rights
      to the planet were purchased by the League and an army depot was established
      on planet. When Davion forces reclaimed the planet after Kerenskyâ€™s Exodus,
      it was discovered that not all of the Star League Defense Force supplies had
      been stripped from the warehouses. Over the following centuries, the Federated
      Suns heavily garrisoned the planet as it was a nearly regular occurrence to
      discover new lost caches of Star League materials.
