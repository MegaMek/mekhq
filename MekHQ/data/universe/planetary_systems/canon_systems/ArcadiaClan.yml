    desc: Arcadia was the first world scouted and colonized by members of the first
      SLDF exodus. In the time between the second exodus and the Clan’s return, the
      population was almost entirely eradicated by war. Environmentally, the planet
      sports dense vegetation and a well-developed eco-system, high volcanism and
      tectonic activity, and a virally-tainted atmosphere. Officially Arcadia’s moon
      is called Aeaea, but is known locally as ‘Liny,’ after the visible lines caused
      by the clouds in its thin atmosphere.
