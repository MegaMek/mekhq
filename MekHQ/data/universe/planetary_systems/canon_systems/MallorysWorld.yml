      A lack of industry would normally make Mallory's World an unimportant backwater, however, its location within easy striking distance of the Draconis Combine has made it strategically important to both the Combine and the Suns throughout the world’s history.

      During the days of the Star League, it was a highly productive agricultural world, but frequent conflicts between the Combine and the Federation have ruined most vegetation on 3 of the planet’s 4 continents (New Helen contains the planet's only arable cropland). Due to this ruination, the Federated Suns and Draconis Combine signed an agreement after the Third Battle for Mallory’s World (3013) to consider the farms and ranches on New Helen untouchable. The massive deforestation on the other three continents leaves them prone to severe windstorms and tornadoes most of the year.

      With three continents unable to support agriculture light manufacturing has cropped up using imported materials. Mallory’s world is one of the leading manufacturers of disposable diapers and semiconductors in it’s sector.

      Most of the population lives in small cities dotting the 4 continents. There are very few large cities. However, the various population centers have been growing steadily with several erecting their own drop ports. Ironically, even though the system’s location is the cause of most of its woes, it also provides the largest portion of the planet’s economy due to constant trade. It has set itself up as a commonly used waypoint for merchants wishing to trade in both the Draconis Combine and Federated Suns.
