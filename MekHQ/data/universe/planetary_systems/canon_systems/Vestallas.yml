      Since the beginning of the 31st century, underground vaults on Vestallas' have stored the Confederation's treasury of hard currency, precious metals, rare paintings, etc. Vestallas is also noted for its unique architectural style, featuring gracefully curved walls as well as gently curved and sloping floors. The style is aesthetically pleasing and keeps the population in a constant state of disequilibrium which has been described as a "natural high" by the locals.

      In 2897, a renegade Special Forces platoon, led by leader Lieutenant Jeremiah Koharken, penetrated a well-guarded vault and attempted to blackmail the government. After Lieutenant Koharken's execution for treason on New Year's Eve 2899, the Confederation moved to ensure that no further military coups would occur by removing all the military units from the planet.
