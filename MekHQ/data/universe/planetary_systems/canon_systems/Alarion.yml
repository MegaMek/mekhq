      Due to blunders during early colonization which led to an incredible death toll to colonists and local wildlife alike from terrestrial and native diseases, strict environmental and settlement regulations were put in place on Alarion that are still in effect. While these regulations strive to preserve the ecosystem and have limited how much of Alarion can be settled, they have not stopped the planet from becoming an economic and industrial powerhouse in the Lyran Commonwealth. Alarion is home to Jumpship, Aerospace and BattleMech factories, making it a world of extreme importance to the Commonwealth.

      Alarion is primarily settled by people of German, Romanian and English descent.
