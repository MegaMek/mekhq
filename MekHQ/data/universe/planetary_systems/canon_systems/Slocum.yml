      3135 - In 2351, the Sarna Supremacy attacked Slocum, then part of the Tikonov Grand Union, and committed acts of merciless savagery. Many battles and wars were fought on Slocum because it was a border world. Following formation of the Star League, it jointly administered the planet with the Capellan Confederation. A Castle Brian was built on each continent of the planet. During the Aramis Coup, Slocum suffered like never before. For eight years, they faced the atrocities of Amaris armies. In 2774, General Kerensky's armies regained control of Slocum, but they discovered that half the population had died of starvation and the ravages of war.

      Slocum‘s continents were severely damaged during the fall of the Star League. Only three of the continents is able to support life. Carnocial, the fourth continent, is still a nuclear wasteland. Fewers, the planetary capital, is located on the continent of Kuaka. Kuaka is in the northern hemisphere, where winter lasts six months out of the year. Just west of the capital are the famous Silver Plains. So named because the snow-covered landscape takes on a silver color thanks to the silver content of the soil. Silver was one of Slocum‘s biggest exports. The continents of Theramule and Natick support most of the planet‘s mining operations and petroleum production.

      The Capellan Confederation laid claim to Slocum after the fall of the Star League and attempted to rebuild the once-vibrant world. During the Fourth Succession War the planet was spared for the most part and prospered afterward as part of the Federated Suns.

      During the Jihad, the Word of Blake forces invaded after they neutralized the defenders with orbital bombardments. When Devlin Stone's forces relieved the planet, once again, they found almost half of the planet‘s population was dead. Between the twin holocausts of the Amaris Coup and the Blakist Jihad, Slocum has become a ghost world, with the inhabitants fleeing as quickly as their finances allow, regardless of every effort by The Republic to remedy the situation.
