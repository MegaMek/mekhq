      Colonists from Terra‘s turbulent Middle East region first attempted to settle Unukalhai during mankind‘s Exodus into space. Unfortunately, soon after they made planetfall these settlers detected a previously unidentified biological taint in the planet‘s air and water supplies, which rendered breathing impossible without respirators and contaminated the soil in a manner harmful to human consumption. Rather than proceed further with their colonization efforts, the original settlers moved on, eventually landing on Zebeneschamali, and relayed their findings on Unukalhai back home—or so they thought.

      A second colonial expedition journeyed to this world only after all efforts to contact the original colonists had failed, but rather than deem the planet unfit, the second expedition, dominated by southeast Asian and Hawaiian pilgrims, decided to pour its efforts into terraforming their new home. Over the centuries—and with the help of a brisk trade with several surrounding systems—the Unukalhaians reclaimed an increasing region of arable land on the massive equatorial continent of Luahali. Living in enclosed settlements, and traveling across the land in environmentally sealed vehicles, the settlers eventually worked out a native antitoxin to the Unukalhaian Taint that allowed most humans to freely breathe the air, drink the water, and eat the native foods with a minimum of ill effects. In the Star League era, this antitoxin was further refined to negate all ill effects and allow visitors and natives alike complete freedom from the nauseating effects of the planet‘s environment. Thanks to that development, settlement of the planet‘s remaining landmasses—Awalia in the north and Lukahanna in the south—exploded, with enterprising colonists eager to establish new cities and towns all over their homeworld.

      In the centuries of the Succession Wars, Unukalhai was largely overlooked by invaders, primarily due to its lack of significant resources, but its proximity to Skye often made it a favored jump-off world for strikes into the Lyran realm. Thus, the cities and towns of this world were largely undamaged by the wars that followed the fall of the Star League, and even the Jihad passed it by with little more than a raid or a brief influx of troops during a stopover period of R and R. Travelers coming to this planet are advised to stop first for the requisite antitoxins at the system‘s jump point station before making landfall at the capital city and spaceport of Wanalulu, located on the southern shores of Luahali.
