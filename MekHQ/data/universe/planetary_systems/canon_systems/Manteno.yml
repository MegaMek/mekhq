    desc: For most of its history, Manteno was a stable and comfortable world with
      vast deposits of minerals, ores and other raw materials. The rich deposits of
      resources led to early success for the planet and extensive industry to take
      advantage of the raw goods extracted from the planet. The planet was prosperous
      and an important manufacturing world for the Federated Suns. Unfortunately during
      the 1st Succession War attacks by the Draconis Combine resulted in the destruction
      of much of the planetâ€™s industry. Just as the planet was beginning to recover
      in the early 31st century the planet began to be plagued by earthquakes and
      heavy volcanic activity. The new geological activity resulted in many residents
      fleeing to other worlds and numerous businesses relocating as well.
