      Butte Hold was originally settled by aqua-culturalists seeking to breed the fish-analogous species of Butte Hold into a source of food for the Rim World Republic in 2597. The Rim World Republic claimed the world and began settling it two decades later and unfortunately those efforts brought about the unsavory criminal organizations that would come to rule the world for centuries to come.

      While the scientists were successful in their original work, the newly modified species was found to be better suited to life on Apollo and Crellacor, taking the planet’s largest employer with it. This move sunk the planet into economic depression that lasted centuries.

      Bandits and organized crime flourished in the resulting conditions and in 2640, the Rim Worlds Republic pulled its forces from the planet and told the locals to police themselves. This left locals at the mercy of the bandits and quality of life declined further. While still technically considered part of the RWR, the planet was essentially on its own.

      Unlike many planets, Butte Hold was unaffected by the fall of the Star League and the Rim Worlds Republic. The lawless life of petty crime lords and bandits continued with power exchanging regularly and pirates using the planet as a base of operations when convenient.
