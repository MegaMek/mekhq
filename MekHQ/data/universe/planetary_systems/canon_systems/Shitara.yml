    desc: "3135 - Founded by a group of corporations in the early days of deep-space
      colonization, Shitara, a world of large landmasses covered with arid mountains,
      expansive deserts and winding grasslands, was not settled for its appearance
      but for its potential as a regional commercial hub. Shitara‘s five main continents—Agito,
      Hokaido, Niijo, Okasaki and Zumi—all fall within the world‘s temperate, tropical
      and equatorial zones but lack many inland freshwater bodies. The rugged terrain
      and relative lack of suitable irrigation made colonies difficult to establish,
      but the corporate engineers who laid out the design for Shitara‘s settlement
      were less concerned with comfort than with setting up business operations. Several
      of the planet‘s first colonies, as a result, were large warehouses, spaceports
      and mining/refining stations. In the decades that followed, as Shitara became
      a jumping-off point for further colonial expansion and a center for trade, more
      settlers came to call this world home. Large commercial cities arose, particularly
      along the river valleys of Okasaki and Zumi, including the present-day capital
      of Hirotomi. Even a few agricultural communities began to appear to support
      the local population. Located well within the Draconis Combine‘s borders after
      that nation expanded to include it and its neighbors, Shitara was spared much
      of the fighting during the Amaris crisis and the Succession Wars. Raids by the
      Dragon‘s enemies were rare, and Shitara prospered, its nearly thirty major spaceport
      cities making it an ideal hub for commercial and military transport. During
      the Jihad, in fact, Shitara was used as a staging ground for strikes against
      the Blakists, serving as a logistical linchpin for several major campaigns.
      Today, Shitara continues to be a transportation and commercial hub, with major
      cities and spaceports on all five continents. Recently, the planet‘s robust
      economy and healthy metal resources have attracted the attention of Klein Manufacturing,
      a small but growing producer of industrial vehicles, including ConstructionMechs
      and MiningMechs. Klein Manufacturing is currently negotiating with the Shitara
      government to establish a major factory complex in the foothills of Agito, just
      outside the commercial city of Galveston.\n "
