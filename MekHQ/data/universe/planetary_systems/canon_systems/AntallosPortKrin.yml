    desc: Antallos was first settled in 2674 by a multinational trading conglomerate
      and managed by the Terran Hegemony with the Star League's blessing. Antallos
      was planned to be a neutral trading hub bringing together the powers of the
      Inner Sphere and the people of the Periphery. While the Star League existed
      the plan was a success and Antallos was vastly wealthy. Unfortunately, the collapse
      of the League saw the planet left to its own and over the centuries raiders,
      pirates and the Great Houses hit the independent planet reducing it from a jewel
      in the Periphery to a no man's land, eventually becoming a pirate haven with
      the dregs of humanity calling the planet home. Antallos is lawless and slavery
      and other illegal trades are the background of the planets economy. Antallos
      supports a small "mercenary" hiring hall, primarily serviced by pirates and
      those looking for less than legal jobs.
