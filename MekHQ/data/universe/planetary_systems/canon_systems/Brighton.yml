      Brighton was originally settled to take advantage of the vast deposits of copper and silver ore that the planet’s initial surveying detected. The planet was independent for its early history before joining the St. Ives Mercantile Association and later the Capellan Confederation.

      As of 3025: Brighton is home to the Confederation's only official political prison. Brighton's workforce was mostly employed as miners in the many copper and silver mines. The remainder routinely served in militia companies that maintain training facilities for local and off-world military units.

      In 2998, the Brighton militia managed to withstand a siege by superior Federated Suns forces for three weeks until relieved by several Warrior House regiments. This battle decided the fate of the St. Ives Commonality during the Third Succession War but resulted in considerable hardship for the civilian population.
