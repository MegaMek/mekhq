      As of 3025 Necromo was populated by only 5,000 people, all of which were employed at the secret Capellan Dropship repair facilities. In order to keep the repair facilities secure only the most loyal workers were selected and even then their families were not allowed to follow them to Necromo, however workers never remained more than 3 months on planet. In 3055 the Aris Memorial Yards were relocated into orbit around Necromo and the Maskirova finally allowed people to live on the planet.

      Necromo is overall a comfortable planet to live despite arid conditions. The planet is primarily covered in rolling hills and forests. Almost the entire population lives inside the domed capital of Landing place.
