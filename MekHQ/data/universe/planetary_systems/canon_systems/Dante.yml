    desc: For most of its history, Dante was a quiet agricultural world with a cool,
      but comfortable, climate and sufficient natural resources but only modest industrial
      concerns and a small population dominated by pacifists. The lack of industry
      and military presence protected the planet from the ravages of the Succession
      Wars, but made the planet easy pickins for a Word of Blake sponsored pirate
      group that took over in the late 3060s. This changed when the Snow Ravens came
      to the Inner Sphere and decided to work with the Outworlds Alliance, after removing
      the pirates that had taken over the planet the Ravens claimed Dante as their
      own and imported several prefabricated factories from the homeworlds as well
      as building their new genetic repository.
