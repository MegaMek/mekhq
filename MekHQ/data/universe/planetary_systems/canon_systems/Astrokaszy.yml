    desc: Despite more than a third of Astrokaszy being covered in water, the single
      large supercontinent is primarily dry, dusty and hot. The planet was left uninhabited
      for most of its history until the 2890s when a rogue mercenary unit fled to
      the planet. The unit fragmented after landing but have formed the backbone of
      the nomads and various city-states that still compose Astrokaszy and rarely
      get along.
