    desc: Columbus was settled in 2549 by deep exploration crews for the Terran Hegemony.
      The station continued as a send off point for explorers throughout the Star
      League and the facilities were eventually upgraded to include a dropship repair
      facility on Amor, the planets moon. The planet was abandoned in 2780, just prior
      to Kerensky's Exodus and remained abandoned until Comstar rediscovered the facility
      in 3023 and began using it as a staging base for their Explorer Corps. The facility
      was very small until the early 3050s when the need to find the Clan Homeworlds
      reignited the need for the Explorer Corps.
