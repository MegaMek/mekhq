      Shiba is a relatively comfortable planet, with abundant natural resources and sufficient agriculture to feed its population, though the planet is not home to significant industry.

      Shiba is home to a Duchy RTC facility, which is located in the flatlands of Abbot and focuses on training vehicle crews and unarmored infantry.
