      Okefenokee is the typical Federated Suns backwater. Okefenokee is covered in jungles and was settled in the 26th century by a religious sect looking for seclusion in deep space. For centuries the planet was mostly independent and left alone, until during the late 3rd Succession War the planet’s large deposits of oil were discovered.

      The native population was not happy about the sudden interest garnered by oil companies and have fought the efforts to industrialize and extract oil primarily through legal channels, however more than a few extremists have taken to more violent means.

      Okefenokee is covered in jungles and swamps that are teeming with life. Unfortunately for anyone unlucky enough to wander into the swamps and jungles, much of these creatures are aggressive. The planet has only three real cities and most of the small population is thinly spread across the planet with usually no more than a few thousand in any community.
