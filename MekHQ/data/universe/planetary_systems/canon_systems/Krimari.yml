      Krimari is a comfortable planet with a climate well suited to human habitation and agriculture. The planet is best known for its medical industries and medical program, which train nurses and doctors that serve throughout the Magistracy. Krimari does not possess a strong industrial base but has enough manufacturing to meet basic civilian needs, supplemented by imports from other planets. Krimari’s only military manufacturing is a small Novis AT-H, Incorporated factory, built in the early 3070s, which produces a single line of hover tanks in the city of Eddymac on the Dorian continent. The planetary capital is the city of Bastion, which is located in the mountains of Dorian.
