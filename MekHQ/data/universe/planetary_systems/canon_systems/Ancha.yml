    desc: The first colonies established on Ancha failed when an undetected viral
      taint decimated their numbers and left the survivors frail and sterile. With
      their transports dismantled for use as colony shelters and equipment, their
      fate went undiscovered until a second wave of colonists found their empty settlements
      nearly two decades later. Thanks to the records left by the first colonists,
      the second wave of settlers managed to find a counteragent to the virus in time
      to spare themselves the same fate. Today, the lost colonies of the first settlers
      remain on the large, southern continent of Gastiogne—a reminder of those who
      came before, cared for by the descendants of the second wave as historical sites.
      Visitors to Ancha must receive regular inoculations against the viral taint
      before and during their stay. Ancha is home to numerous small industries, primarily
      focused on the automotive and civilian aircraft industries. Its other continent,
      Normandy, is home to the planetary capital of New Summit, as well as the spaceport
      city of Armitage.
