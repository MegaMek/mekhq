    desc: Kuzuu is a quiet, mostly agricultural world known for long, reasonably mild
      seasons, particularly in its middle-latitude continents of Oahana and Entiko.
      A large world, with modest deposits of industrial metals and other valuable
      resources, Kuzuu developed heavy industry very slowly compared to most of its
      neighbors, as a majority of the original settlers preferred the quieter farming
      and ranching life to the hustle of heavy industry and commerce. Because of this,
      the planet was largely overlooked by raiders throughout the Age of War and the
      first three Succession Wars, a factor that helped protect its natural beauty
      and even drew those seeking a return to the simpler life. In the Fourth Succession
      War, Kuzuu went from being an interior world of the Draconis Combine to being
      the front line against future FedCom aggression, perched just beyond the tip
      of the united Commonwealth‘s new ―Lyons Thumb. The increased military presence
      this new position warranted led to a boom in local industry and the economy
      to support the planet‘s defense, and so, by the close of the thirty-first century,
      Kuzuu boasted a population of more than two billion, almost equally divided
      among urban and rural population centers. The capital city of Arbeesi is located
      on the industrialized northern continent of Shanaro.
