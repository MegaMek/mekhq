      Tyrfing was discovered in the early days of humanity’s exploration of the stars but passed over for early colonization due to a carbon-dioxide rich and oxygen poor atmosphere. By the early 2200s the planet was re-evaluated due to the discovery of an abundance of industrial-grade minerals.

      Originally settled as nothing more than a mining operation, after a contract awarded to Pacific Trans-Stellar, with miners required to live in self-contained outposts. Despite a lack of interest in making the planet fit for true colonization the corporation as part of their contract was required to try to terraform it. They hired another firm to seed the planet with plants to scrub the CO2 and replace it with O2. Unknown to the Terran Alliance or Pacific Trans-Stellar, the company hired was also seeding colonists. By the time of the Outer Reaches Rebellion, the planet had almost 100,000 unregistered residents living in hidden cities throughout fast-growing jungles.

      Cutoff from the rest of humanity, the colonists and miners were forced into conflict but eventually, neither were able to survive on the planet and within 20 years, the planet was again uninhabited. However, the jungles continued to grow and work to reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

      In 2350, new settlers found the planet and completed the terraforming processes started decades before. This time, colonization was successful and Tyrfing became a bustling, if unremarkable world by Terran Hegemony standards for the next four centuries.

      Unfortunately, like so many other worlds, Tyrfing fell along with the Star League during the Amaris Civil War and the following First Succession War. An outbreak of disease and a lack of medical facilities meant a crippled world became a dying world. The Free Worlds League quarantined the world in 2824 and it was lost from the records after.

      After its fall, humans continued to live on Tyrfing at a basic hunter-gatherer level of civilization.
