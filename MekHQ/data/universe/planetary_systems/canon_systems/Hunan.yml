      3135 - Hunan's atmosphere is tainted by tons of sulfur vapor produced by hundreds of volcanoes located on the main equatorial continent of Hell. Hell is completely devoid of life. The population of the planet lives in Kamala, the only continent that can support life. Kamala's landscape is a frozen lava flow, reddish-brown in color, with sulfurous, steam-belching geysers and half-melted purple hillsides. On the outskirts of Hunan City, the capital, the Hellfire Mountains are made up of volcanoes and hot springs that make the use of infrared scans nearly impossible and the sulfur vapors hamper radar and magscans.

      The planet would not have been colonized if it were not for the massive ore and metals deposits found on all five continents. The island continents of Roc, Zeka, and Bandar are also home to Fire Lizards that can spit, with deadly accuracy up to 10 metres, a caustic liquid that causes intense burns. Eventually the Fire Lizard population was brought under control and a few domed cities were built so that humans could mine the land.

      Hunan was relatively peaceful throughout its history and did not see any military action until near the end of the Jihad. A retreating Word of Blake unit that had been routed at the Battle of Sian landed on Roc. After a week, the Blakists captured one of the domed cities. A few days later, the Hunanites destroyed the dome, killing nearly all the invaders. The Fire Lizards took care of the rest.
