      Brownsville was not immediately inhabitable but proved to be easily terraformed and minimal efforts by the Terran Hegemony resulted in a world with a stable, flourishing ecosystem. The first settlers in early the 2300s found a paradise in the continental interiors. Young forests. Green meadows. Rains and clean water filled with fish.

      Temperate continents like Indiana and Iowa were settled more heavily than the steamy equatorial lands of California or the arid, fjord-pierced continent of Texas. Most cities and habitations were settled well inland, away from the brown, polluted looking oceans. The planet thrived for hundreds of years, with abundant resources, agriculture, and industry.

      Unfortunately, the planet suffered heavily during the Amaris civil war and never truly recovered. Even more tragic, the planet was susceptible to the loss of atmospheric processors and the atmosphere became slowly more tainted by the 2800s and by 2850 most animal life had died from low oxygen levels and humans required respirators. The planet was formally abandoned in 2862. While thousands were evacuated by ComStar, millions more were left to die.
