      Alphard is the capital of the Marian Hegemony and the nation's seat of power. Alphard is an arid planet full of canyons and arroyos. There is just barely enough arable land on the northern continents for the planet to be self sufficient. Just below the surface Alphard contains vast deposits of metals and gemstones. After the formation of the Hegemony in the late 30th Century, Alphard has seen the introduction of industry picked up in the later part of the 31st Century. The planetary capital is Nova Roma, which was built in the style of ancient Rome out of the local golden sandstone, and is a matter of pride for the young Periphery nation.

      Alphard is home to several industrial concerns, including the Alphard Trading Corporation which produces combat vehicles and during the Word of Blake Jihad upgraded to produce primitive BattleMechs. The factory is located in the hilly city of O’Reilly on the Italia continent. The other primary factory is the Marian Arms, Incorporated, located in the valleys of the Alba continent. THe Marian Arms factory produces combat vehicles, BattleMechs and during the Word of Blake Jihad expanded to also produce primitive BattleMechs.
