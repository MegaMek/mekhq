    desc: Vendrell is a relatively comfortable planet with a temperate climate, nearly
      standard gravity and enough arable land to feed its population. Unfortunately,
      the planet is resources poor and the high-pressure atmosphere can be slightly
      irritating to off-worlders, but the air is breathable. Vendrell is home to a
      small Mountain Wolf BattleMechs factory, which was originally established during
      the Star League. Damage during the Succession Wars put an end to the plant in
      2945 after a raid by forces from the Free Worlds League. However, 110 years
      later the plant reopened in 3055 and the plant managed to survive the Word of
      Blake Jihad, though supply disruptions resulted in a reduction in factory output.
      The factory is located in the small mountain town of Monte Lupus, located on
      the Kaspur continent. Rosewood, the planetary capital is located on the Zanzibar
      continent, which is primarily covered in wetlands and swamps.
