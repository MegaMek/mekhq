    desc: 3135 - A small world, with jungles covering much of its four main landmasses,
      Capolla‘s rich metal ore deposits and other raw materials drew many settlers
      when the planet was discovered in the twenty-second century. Even before the
      days of the Star League, this world had developed such a strong and diverse
      economic and social base—devoid of any major military industries—that the government
      of the Terran Hegemony allowed the planet a limited autonomy, along with its
      neighboring system, Terra Firma. The Capellan Confederation, which seized the
      world after the fall of the League, and even the Federated Commonwealth after
      that, continued this policy of laissez-faire, which contributed to the formation
      of the short-lived Terracap Confederation by the two worlds after the collapse
      of the Commonwealth. Even the Word of Blake, in exchange for the right to place
      military bases and “re-education facilities” on-planet before the Jihad, continued
      the hands-off policy toward the tiny alliance‘s political and business affairs,
      and pledged their troops to the defense of these two worlds. In this latter
      case, however, the citizens of Capolla and its neighboring Terra Firma became
      unwitting accomplices in the Jihad, turning a blind eye to the Blakists‘ atrocities
      in exchange for their own worlds‘ relative safety. When allied forces came to
      drive off the Blakist defenders, the native militias were split along pro-Blakist
      and anti-Blakist lines, and Capolla‘s cities suffered grievous damage in the
      fighting. The majority of Capolla‘s population today lives in large cities,
      including the planetary capital of Stockdale, nestled in the planet‘s many mountain
      valleys on the equatorial continents of Konowalchuk and Dominus. Most of the
      on-world mining operations, today run by seven planet-wide conglomerates, are
      based in the mountains of these continents as well. The southern polar continent
      of Matlabor, by contrast, hosts several oil and natural gas processing stations,
      only recently restored to their peak performance of almost a century ago. The
      city of Parisia, on the northern island continent of New Australia, is home
      to the main offices of Thaddeus Enterprises, an interplanetary shipping corporation
      that aided the planetary government in the redevelopment of its spaceport network,
      which had been largely destroyed in the fighting following the Federated Commonwealth
      break-up.
