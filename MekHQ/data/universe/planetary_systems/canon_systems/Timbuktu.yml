      Over its history, Timbuktu's position on the Periphery border has resulted in it being the target of numerous pirate raids. Timbuktu is located relatively close to its sun and as a result most of the planet is covered in badlands and desert. The planet can barely grow enough agriculture to sustain its population and is overall a resource poor world. The only raw materials that can be found are located in the volcanic southern continent of Hades. The planets capital, Greene, is located on the northern super-continent Saharius. Saharius is covered in a mix of grasslands and desert wastes.

      Timbuktu has been a staging ground used by the Lyran Commonwealth to coordinate anti-piracy actions from the fringes of the realm. In later years, Timbuktu became a stop-over for merchants looking to trade with the Rim Collection.
