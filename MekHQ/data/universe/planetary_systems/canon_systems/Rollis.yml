    desc: Rollis is best known as a stopping off point from the Capallen Confederation
      into the Periphery, though it was originally settled by the Taurians and taken
      by the Federated Suns for two centuries before Rollis was conquered by the Capellans
      in the 1st Succession War. The planet is temperate and would be quite comfortable
      if not for the low pressure atmosphere. Rollis is able to support enough agriculture
      to support its people, though there are few other natural resources and little
      industry. The system does not support a recharge station at either jump point,
      however it does have a small orbital station that allows for dropship and small
      craft refit and repair. The primary export form Rollis is timber, specifically
      wood harvested from the equatorial island of Iskandia, which is fragrant like
      cedar and nearly fire-resistant. Rollis is home to a Duchy RTC that trains vehicle
      crews and unarmored infantry. Due to the planet's low population, the RTC is
      able to use vast swaths of undeveloped land for training and large scale combat
      exercises.
