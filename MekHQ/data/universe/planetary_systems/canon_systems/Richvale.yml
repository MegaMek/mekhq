      Richvale is a relatively unremarkable world, with a relatively comfortable climate, though on the hot and humid end of the scale. The planet’s warm climate allows for long growing seasons and supports enough agriculture to feed the people of Richvale. Despite only moderate natural resources, Richvale is home to one of the primary Quikscell Company manufacturing plants. Quickscell is the famous (or infamous) creator of such mainstays on the battlefield as the AC/2 Carrier, Tracked APC, Condor Heavy Tank, Heavy Tracked APC, Laser Carrier, LRM Carrier, Saxon APC, Scorpion Light Tank and SRM Carrier combat vehicles. Quikscell is also known for quantity over quality, a belief that carries over to their factories and the plant on Richvale is the more frequently fined than any other facility in the Lyran Commonwealth due to failures to keep up with the realm’s regulations. Quikscell chooses to pay the fines instead of fixing its patchwork facilities and the facility has only managed to continue operations, despite failing to meet regulations, because it employs more than a quarter of Richvale’s population and the planetary government chooses to ignore problems and assist in fixing any major issues, to avoid the backlash that closing the factory would create. The plant is located in the city of Harlowe Falls on rainy badlands of the Beta continent.
