      Somerset is an unassuming backwater planet with a comfortable climate and high levels of agriculture but little else to bring the planet unwanted attention. Originally settled by a group of settlers that were forced to flee their original planets three times under threat of invasion before finally settling on Somerset. The planet was eventually absorbed into the Rim Worlds Republic and remained part of the Republic until being brought into the Lyran Commonwealth after the Amaris Coup. The planet didn’t change hands again for nearly 200 years until Operation Revival when it was captured by the Jade Falcons.

      The planet Somerset is best known for two things, first as the location of the AFFC’s second victory over the Clans, though they could not hold the world after the victory, and as a primary focus for the Somerset Strikers’ Holovid, which made claims that the Falcons rounded up the entire population and shipped them back to the Clan Homeworlds to toil as slaves. This last fact is a point of surprise to the residents of Somersets, as the Falcons primarily ignored the backwater world after conquering it.
