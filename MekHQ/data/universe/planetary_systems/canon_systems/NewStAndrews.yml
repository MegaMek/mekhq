      New St. Andrews is a remote Periphery world settled by four Irish Clans with a long history of relocating before finally settling on New St. Andrews. In 2294, they fled their original homeworld of Stewart prior to the planet’s absorption into the Free Worlds League. From Stewart they settled York and Lancaster before fleeing again in response to the planets’ annexation by the Protectorate of Donegal. The clans found themselves on Loxley before being displaced again when Archon Robert Marsden of the Lyran Commonwealth annexed the pastoral world. They landed on Somerset in the Rim Worlds Republic, which they hoped would be their final destination and it was for several centuries until the Amaris Coup. Fearing the destruction of the Republic, the clans again abandoned a world in the late 28th century and founded New St. Andrews. Due to the haste of the final move, the clans settled the planet with little technology an established a small agriculture-driven society on New Scotland, the planet’s northern continent.

      There the four clans divided the lands and got by on subsistence level farming until the clans grew and border disputes became common. Luckily, before the disputes could become full scale war between the four clans, the settlement was discovered by their Periphery neighbors and pirates soon followed. The outside attacks caused some of the clans to band together and convinced others to become little more than raiders. The planet was fighting an ongoing war between the clans until near the end of the Word of Blake Jihad.

      Meridian Manufacturing, owned by clans Stewart and MacGregor, is located on New St. Andrews and produces the Arbiter IndustrialMech and acquired the plans for Wasps and Stingers as of 3081.
