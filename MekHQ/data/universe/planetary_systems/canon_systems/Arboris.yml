    desc: "3135 - Arboris was originally colonised for its fertile soil by settlers
      from the Capellan Hegemony. Arboris has three continents - Jeruc, Silverado
      and Bandar. Jeruc is the largest, covering over 38 percent of the planet, and
      is located in the northern hemisphere. The remaining two continents are island
      continents about the same size as Australia on Terra. Jeruc produces the majority
      of the planet‘s agro-products from its vast flat plains and valleys. The main
      industries on Silverado and Bandar are timber and mineral mining. The majority
      of the population is located on Jeruc, where many are farmers or work to support
      the planet‘s major industry. The capital, Kansas Plain, which located on Kansas
      Plateau, the largest plain, in the southwest of Jeruc. Kansas Plateau wheat
      grows taller than BattleMechs.\n\nArboris has a history of fierce independence.
      In 2308, Arboris seceded from the Capellan Hegemony in protest over the taxes
      and draft imposed to support an unjustifiable war. After the end of the Capellan-Supremacy
      War, Arboris again returned to Capellan rule. However, neither the Capellan
      Confederation nor later, the Federated Commonwealth, succeeded in fully assimilating
      the planet. During the Chaos March conflict, the population refused to submit
      to the invading Capellan forces. The Farmers Freedom Army rose up against the
      invaders and through sheer willpower forced the Capellans and militia forces
      off the continent of Jeruc. When the Jihad came to Arboris, the population chose
      to side with the Word of Blake forces rather than deal with either of the previous
      conquerors. The population aided the Blakists in hunting down the remaining
      militia and Capellan forces. "
