    desc: For most of its history, Waldorff was a fairly unimportant planet in the
      Lyran Commonwealth, with a relatively comfortable atmosphere and climate and
      moderate resources and industry, including a sizeable munitions factory, though
      the only abundant resource on planet was agriculture. During Operation Revival,
      Waldorff was captured by Clan Jade Falcon, who were required to share the planet
      with the Steel Vipers by the IlKhan. The Steel Vipers made the planet their
      Inner Sphere capital and began upgrading the infrastructure and manufacturing
      on the world but eventually lost Waldorff and the rest of their Inner Sphere
      holdings to the Falcons.
