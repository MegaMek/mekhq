      An unremarkable, small world blanketed by grasslands and tundra, Deneb Kaitos is famous as the home of the Deneb Light Cavalry, elite Federated Suns BattleMech regiments descended from the special forces of the First Star League. Originally settled by the Terran Hegemony, Deneb‘s population began to starve when food shipments were cut off after the fall of the First Star League. In response, the Fourth Deneb Light Cavalry, one of the Star League‘s Rapid Deployment Mixed Armed Forces (or RDMAF) regiments, did not join Kerensky‘s Exodus, and signed on with the Federated Suns military instead in exchange for food shipments to Deneb Kaitos.

      Deneb Kaitos has remained under House Davion‘s banner except for a brief period of Capellan occupation during the Third Succession War. Although the makeup of the Deneb Light Cavalry eventually reflected that of all Federated Suns worlds, men and women who grew up in Deneb Kaitos‘s rugged sheepherding lifestyle continued to be the Cavalry‘s most ardent and effective MechWarriors. When the Blakist Holy War hit Deneb Kaitos, many Light Cavalry units, along with innumerable retirees from the Cavalry, were lost defending the world. When The Republic of the Sphere was founded, some of the remaining Deneb Light Cavalry regiments joined the Republic defense forces.

      The continent of Baten is home to the capital of Cetus and is located in the northern hemisphere; the continents of Menkar and Mira straddle the equator.
