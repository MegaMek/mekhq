      Northwind was original colonized by the Stuart clan from Scotland. The Stuarts were joined by the remnants of the independent Scottish military, the Highlanders. In 2362, the ruling Clans of Northwind elected to create a military unit to defend their planet, the result was the Northwind Highlanders. The Highlanders acted as a garrison force of their home for centuries and eventually members from Northwind served in the Star League Defense Force, including the prestigious Black Watch. After the collapse of the Star League the Highlanders became mercenaries. The Highlanders became cut off from their homeworld in the 29th century while in the employ of the Capellan Confederation when Northwind was conquered by the Federated Suns.

      Northwind is a prosperous world with three relatively well populated and industrialized continents.
