    desc: Eden is home to Novy Moscva, which was the capital city of the Star League
      in Exile. Most of the settlements on Eden are contained within 20’ of the equator,
      known as the ‘life band,’ where most of the world’s precipitation falls. The
      life band is rich with native flora and fauna, but many terrestrial species
      also thrive here – some more so than on Terra. Unfortunately the same cannot
      be said for humans, as the atmosphere contains a viral taint, which cause the
      ‘brain fever’ that killed many of the early SLDF setters – including General
      Aleksandr Kerensky’s wife.
