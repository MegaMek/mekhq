      A small world blasted by its white-hot parent star, Ankaa held little promise for settlers during the first waves of interstellar colonization. Only 400 years after the first JumpShips left Terra did Sunni Muslim settlers land on Ankaa, one of the few uninhabited worlds left in the Inner Sphere by that time. These colonists decided to make a new life in Ankaa‘s polar regions, with their deadly climate and desolate but beautiful landscapes.

      In Arabic, Ankaa means ―the Phoenix, and its settlers sought to make Ankaa a new center of Islamic faith in the Terran Hegemony during the First Star League. Deposits of rare metals were also found in Ankaa‘s lower latitudes during this time, greatly enriching the population.

      After the fall of the First Star League, the Federated Suns briefly inherited Ankaa. However, the Capellan Confederation coveted Ankaa‘s mineral wealth and captured Ankaa by the middle of the First Succession War. House Liao held the world until House Davion recaptured Ankaa in the Third Succession War.

      Ankaa created many Islamic martyrs when the Blakist Holy War came to the world. When The Republic of the Sphere invited Clan factions to settle on Republican worlds during the Golden Age of Peace, a small number of Nova Cats chose Ankaa for the spiritual vision of its native Muslim population.

      The capital of Anqabad is located near the north pole.
