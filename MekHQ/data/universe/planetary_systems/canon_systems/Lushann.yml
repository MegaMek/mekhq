    desc: Lushann is a semi-arctic planet, which was primarily settled to take advantage
      of the abundant oil deposits in the planet. In fact, almost two-thirds of the
      planet’s modest population work for the various petrochemical companies that
      are based on Lushann. The planet supplies most of the petrochemicals for the
      entire Outworlds Alliance. The other major industry on Lushann is Lushann Industries,
      a weapons manufacturer, the regional supplier of laser weaponry. After the arrival
      of Clan Snow Ravens, the factories on Lushann were improved to include Aerospace
      and limited ‘Mech production.
