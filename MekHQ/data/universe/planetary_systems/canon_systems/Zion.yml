    desc: Zion spent much of its history suffering under the oppressive Capellan Confederation
      and the majority of the population were happy to see the planet come under the
      control of the Free Worlds League. Unfortunately, the looming marriage of Sun-Tzu
      Liao and Isis Marik in the 3050s caused tensions to boil over when the population
      feared a return to Capellan rule on planet. There was a short-lived rebellion
      which was put down by the Free Worlds League Military, the collapse of the marriage
      deal came as little comfort to the people of Zion with the scars remaining on
      the planet from the revolt. By the 3060s the planet was well on its way to recovery,
      despite small terrorist groups continuing to carry out attacks, preventing the
      official return of civilian government to the planet.
