    desc: 3025 - New Abilene was settled in 2581 and since that time the planet has
      seen numerous battles between the Canopians and Taurians, vying for control
      of this border world. The planet's economy is primarily focused on agriculture
      with large tracts of land devoted to cattle and sheep farming. The planet is
      divided into numerous large baronies controlled by wealthy landowners who tend
      to own the largest herds on planet. There are numerous disputes between the
      Barons over water rights and the best grazing areas. Escalation in these disputes
      led to the hiring of "Range Riders", MechWarriors hired to serve the local barons,
      which only led to further fighting along the edges of the baronies. Eventually
      forces from the Magistracy were sent to act as frontier marshalls and to keep
      the peace.
