      The Tanite system is composed of multiple planets and was colonized by people calling themselves the Tanites that unknowingly existed within several jumps of the Clans for quite some time. When the system was discovered the Clans soon moved in and took over, though they never quite subdued the Tanites, who buckled under the restrictive Clan Class structure. Three of the four planets in the system are colonized.

      Stacha is the 1st planet (of 4) in the Tanis system and is a temperate planet, and the most comfortable planet in the system. The equitorial temperature is 28 degress centigrade and the landmasses of Stacha are dominated by flat plains and badlands. Stacha is the second most populated planet in the Tanis system.

      Tanis is the 2nd planet in the Tanis system and despite relatively low gravity (0.7) compared to Terra, the planet has a comfortable atmosphere and was well populated by the Tanites before the clans discovered the system. Tanis has terrain that varies from vast flat plains to towering mountains. The equitorial temperature is 35 degrees centigrade.

      Alexandra is the 3rd planet in the Tanis system and is relatively temperate, though on the cold side with an equitorial temperature of 22 degrees centigrade. The primary terrain features on Alexandra are mountains and badlands.
