      Orestes is a temperate planet with a massive rainforest ringing the equator. The planet has ample arable land and modest natural resources to feed its heavy industries, including Odin Manufacturing, which has been creating BattleMechs since 2310. The rainforest on Orestes supports trees that stand as much as 500 meters tall and completely blanket out the sun. In this pitch-black environment the local Orestes viper lizards thrive and hunt in packs of up to 30. Even after centuries of inhabiting the planet, factory and farm workers living near the rainforest are in danger of attack from the viper lizards.

      Orestes has the distinction of being one of the few planets in the Free Rasalhague Republic that were not captured by the Clans during Operation Revival. The arrival of ComGuard defenders following their victory at Tukayyid created a boom in the local economy, unfortunately many of those jobs ended up going to refugees fleeing the Clans from Lyran and Combine planets, which caused a great deal of resentment between long time residents and their new neighbors.
