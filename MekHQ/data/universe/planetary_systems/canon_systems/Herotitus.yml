    desc: Herotitus is a pleasant agricultural world with long, mild growing seasons
      and large portions of the planet’s northern continents , Baccali and Pomona,are
      almost entirely devoted to ranching and farming. The southern continent of Marpessa
      on the other hand is more developed and known for its large mountains and deep
      canyons, it is also the site of most of the planet’s major cities. Herotitus
      is fortunate, as an independent Periphery planet, its location between the Taurian
      Concordat, Magistracy of Canopus and Capellan Confederation has spared it from
      most pirate activities and its lack of military worth has spared it from the
      constant raiding of the three powers. Herotitus attracted hedonists in the 30th
      century and they turned the cities of the planet into tourist attractions where
      people could seek out any and all types of pleasure, with resorts, casinos and
      brothels. In the mid-31st century Herotitus became the unofficial site of a
      mercenary hiring hall due to the planet’s natural attraction to mercenaries
      looking for a break and seeking the recreation offered on the planet.
