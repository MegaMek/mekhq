      3135 - Alcor is one of the few worlds that orbits a slightly variable star and has an atmosphere and environment capable of supporting life. The planet's remote orbit mitigate the gravitational stresses caused during the infrequent shifts of its star's outer surface. The tectonic stresses created by the star have still contributed to a number of volcanoes that line the mountain chains on the main continents of Galvinia and Fuchisa. Much of the planet's mining industry has been focused in these volcanic regions. The arable land on Alchiba is exceedingly poor in nutrients, forcing the planet to rely on trade with their neighboring systems for vital agricultural products. Ursamajorisaeti, the capital of Alcor and home of the planet's largest spaceport, is located on Galvina. Alcor has been the hub of local trade routes throughout its history. During the Succession Wars, it has been a poor staging world for raids and invasions, though it has still been the target of many.

      Alcor was overlooked during the Jihad, the only known fighting that took place in system occurred when Blakist aerospace fighters, DropShips, and JumpShips, who were intercepted here during their flight from Terra.
