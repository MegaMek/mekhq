      Moore is a wet world, its total landmass locked up in almost a thousand small islands and the long, thin, mountainous chain known as Serpentasia. This half-wooded, half-swampy land runs in an irregular northwest-to-southeast path across Moore‘s surface, and is home to the vast majority of the planetary population, including the capital city of Shizuoka.

      Because of abundant germanium, titanium, and uranium deposits, this world was a prize to both the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony alike during humanity‘s Golden Age, and it was to secure these valuable resources that both realms agreed to share the planet between them. This shared-world status spared Moore the horrors of the Amaris crisis when the Usurper, secure in his hold over House Kurita, allowed Combine troops to hold the planet unmolested during his reign of terror. When Amaris and his troops fell to the SLDF, and the League itself collapsed soon after, Moore became a de facto holding of the Combine. The Combine jealously defended Moore after claiming it, losing it to house Steiner‘s Lyran Commonwealth for only a few decades in the twenty-fourth century.
