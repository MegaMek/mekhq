    desc: A water-rich world with a host of natural resources, Syrma was a dream world
      for colonial developers when it was first discovered during mankind‘s early
      exploration of deep space. Ironically enough, the first settlers to set foot
      on this world would not be industrialists or commercial entrepreneurs, but pilgrims
      from various anti-technology cultures and religious beliefs. Including representatives
      from Amish, Native American, and African cultures, these pilgrims established
      several agricultural communes throughout the arable interiors of Ezera, Lothair,
      Quan, and Rashida—Syrma‘s four main landmasses. In the wake of the Terran Alliance‘s
      fall, these colonists suddenly found themselves cut off from contact with Terra,
      but their industrious nature made it possible for them to survive as an independent
      world for a time. The rise of the seemingly aggressive Terran Hegemony, however,
      soon prompted the community leaders of Syrma to seek outside help in maintaining
      their independence, and so they sought aid from the nearby Federation of Skye.
      When Hegemony ships arrived over Syrma, mines and “smart” missiles, planted
      at the jump points by the Federation, smashed much of the Hegemony fleet. The
      Syrma Disaster, as the Hegemony citizens called it, cast into question the viability
      of the McKenna family as a ruling line, and inevitably led to the foundation
      of the Cameron dynasty. As for Syrma, its alliance with Skye led to the opening
      of the world to increasingly modernized industries, though the anti-technology
      sects retained their own sizable enclaves. By the Star League era, this planet
      had become a jointly administered border world between the Lyran Commonwealth
      and the Terran Hegemony, with a curious mix of primitive and technocratic lifestyles.
      Because of the ample resources here, Amaris‘ troops landed hard on Syrma, executing
      much of the government—Lyran and Hegemony alike—after brutally seizing control.
      Their efforts to enslave the anti-technology sects as laborers for the mines
      and factories ultimately led to some of the greatest atrocities of the Amaris
      Crisis. Syrma would not be freed until Kerensky‘s return years later. After
      the fall of the League, the Lyran government claimed Syrma and invested heavily
      in the reconstruction of its industrial infrastructure, but largely overlooked
      the descendants of the planet‘s original settlers and their agro-communes. This
      trend, continued over the centuries of warfare, eventually led to the near extinction
      of these simpler communes. Even today, the few remaining settlements left over
      from the original pilgrims are little more than tourist attractions in Syrma‘s
      outback; a mere handful of surviving communities from a bygone era. Syrma‘s
      capital, Skopje, is located on Lothair‘s southern reaches, and is home to the
      planet‘s largest spaceport—two others may be found in the cities of Scottsdale
      and Strausborg, on Ezera and Rashida, respectively—as well as the headquarters
      of DePaik Resource Solutions, a mining and refining company owned by the planet‘s
      ruling family.
