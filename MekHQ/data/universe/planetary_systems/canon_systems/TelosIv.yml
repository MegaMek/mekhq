    desc: Cursed with a weak ozone layer that lets in more than the average amount
      of solar radiation, Telos IV is a warm, dreary world of continual rainstorms
      and freak tornadoes that ravage all four of its island continents in the middle
      latitudes. Surviving despite these hazards, the people of this world have developed
      a reputation for being stubborn and fiercely independent, a reputation that
      has caused them no small share of problems over the centuries when dealing with
      the greater realms. Shiro Kurita, founder of the Draconis Combine, manipulated
      the people of Telos IV into joining his growing state through guile and political
      trickery. When the deceit was discovered, the Telosians revolted, which prompted
      the first Coordinator to invade the planet as a demonstration of the Combine‘s
      superiority. In the years that followed, the population remained stubborn. Though
      suppressed for a time, the Kuritas found the Telosians difficult to deal with,
      as they resorted to passive resistance instead of outright rebellion. Since
      Telos IV lacked significant mineral or agricultural wealth, the Combine willingly
      ceded the world to the rising Terran Hegemony, hoping its dissident population
      would give the Camerons as much trouble as it had the Kuritas. At first, the
      Telosians did just that, but Hegemony efforts to improve relations with the
      planet, which included placing several storm inhibitors (similar to those employed
      on Bryant) in Telos IV‘s orbit, helped win over the locals. This amicable relationship
      helped during the Amaris Crisis, when the Usurper, finding little of value on
      Telos IV, abandoned the world after demolishing the storm inhibitors and planetary
      defense network. Kerensky‘s forces found support on Telos IV when they arrived
      and easily advanced on their campaign of liberation. Returned to Kurita rule
      after the fall of the League, the Telosians resumed their attitude of passive
      resistance, which prevented the Dragon from exploiting the planet‘s modest resources
      to the fullest, even centuries later. However, this attitude underwent marked
      improvement after the reforms enacted by Coordinator Theodore Kurita. When Telos
      IV was ceded to the Republic, its inhabitants had mixed feelings about the transfer
      and initially balked at the resettlement directives. Today, however, the warm
      and stormy world of Telos IV is tranquil once again, secure in the freedoms
      of the Terran Hegemony‘s closest successor. The capital of Telos IV, Triumph,
      is located on the large northern continent of Dulles. Telos IV's other three
      continents—Rustov on the equator and Fellin and Haranshire in the southern hemisphere—are
      home to a scattering of large cities and mining towns.
