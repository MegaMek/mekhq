    desc: 3135 - A large world of large oceans, diverse wildlife, and a few veins
      of mineral resources, the biggest obstacles to the colonization of Yorii were
      the planet‘s stronger-than-average gravity, its native, territorial wildlife,
      and the fact that its soils did not support the majority of Terran food crops.
      None of these factors proved insurmountable to the early colonists, however,
      who simply learned to adapt and established thriving industrial and mining communities
      on three of Yorii‘s four island-continents. Heavy-metal deposits, some very
      deep below the planetary surface, and most accessible to off-shore drilling
      platforms, provided the basis of the planetary economy, while the few hybrid
      food crops that could be grown became the staples of the planet‘s mostly Asian
      population. On the continent of Yokohama, where the dominant native life-form,
      the Yoriian tiger-raptor, was most populous, the colonists built high walls
      around their settlements and farmlands, and began a hunting initiative that
      brought the bold reptilian predators under control within a decade. In the days
      of the Star League, Yorii‘s capital city, Neo-Tokyo, set on the shore of the
      planet‘s largest continent, Shokaku, was a haven for commercial trade between
      the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony, and a healthy portion of the city's
      population claimed dual citizenship in both realms. During the Amaris crisis,
      the Usurper‘s troops used many of Yorii‘s larger cities and industrial complexes
      as battlefields when the SLDF came to liberate the planet, which ravaged the
      planet‘s economy and infrastructure, rendering millions homeless and millions
      more dead. Neo-Tokyo was left totally uninhabitable when the last of Amaris‘
      holdouts deliberately sabotaged the fusion reactor that powered the city in
      an effort to distract the League troops while they made an escape attempt. The
      Draconis Combine easily assimilated Yorii after the fall of the League, establishing
      the planet as a forward base for raids against the Lyran Commonwealth, Capellan
      Confederation, and Federated Suns. Despite numerous punitive raids and the ravages
      of the Succession Wars, Yorii gradually managed to reclaim some of its former
      prosperity, only to lose it again when Word of Blake forces struck during the
      Jihad. Today, Yorii is a recovering world, its mining and manufacturing settlements
      only now reaching their pre-Jihad capacity, while farmlands poisoned by the
      Blakist troops still lie fallow. Each of the four populated continents—Shokaku
      in the south, Yokohama to its northeast, Khesan and Xu-Lai in the north—now
      support a handful of major cities, with the new capital city of Shenobi on Yokohama.
