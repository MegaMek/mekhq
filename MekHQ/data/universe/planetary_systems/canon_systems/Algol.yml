      3135 - Algol, originally part of the old Tikonov Union, became an important agricultural center during the height of Star League. Algol has two major continents and a few islands. The largest continent, Shalom, contains the planetary capital of Algol City, that was founded on the coast due to the abundance of fish found in the surrounding waters. Durant, the other continent, has extremely rich soil that allows the production of a wide range of agricultural products. The largest city, Kollasa, is home to the planet‘s massive food-processing plants. Algol‘s food exports are transported to Algol City for shipment off world through its large spaceport. Algol produced enough food to trade with and supply all the worlds within one jump.

      Groffer‘s Toll, located 150 kilometers south of Algol City, was home to a massive Federated Suns munitions plant and storage depot. The city of Schan, located on Durant, is the planet‘s largest source of potassium and other important chemicals used in the production of munitions.

      Unlike other nearby worlds, Algol‘s food production has kept the horrors of war from visiting it. When the Word of Blake launched the Jihad, the Federated Suns troops on planet surrendered in order to protect the planet and its people from the threat of weapons of mass destruction. The AFFS troops were interned in a makeshift prison in the AFFS depot at Groffer's Toll. The Blakist commander ordered the destruction of the depot and the deaths of all but a handful of AFFS troops after they attempted to escape.
