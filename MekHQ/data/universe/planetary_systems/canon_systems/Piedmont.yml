    desc: '3135 - By all accounts a lovely and bountiful world, with lush forests
      and jungles covering the better part of its six main continents, Piedmont nonetheless
      hid a secret that nearly wiped out the first colonists to make planetfall. Rich
      mineral deposits in the mountains, particularly on the equatorial continents
      of Victoria and Anistasi, drew the first settlers, who established several mining
      and refining outposts in the intervening valleys. Three other continents, Austin
      and Calcutta in the north and Mollasia in the south, boasted fertile lands,
      well-irrigated by a series of rivers and inland lakes, as well as a diverse
      ecology of mostly harmless wild beasts. The planet‘s perfect native splendor
      took a turn for the worse as the population began to expand across Calcutta:
      an epidemic suddenly broke out in the community of Chun-Gai. The neurological
      virus, which had evolved from native bacteria in the thick tropical jungles
      of Calcutta‘s lower latitudes and which spread through a host of vectors, including
      human contact and airborne infection, came to be known as chungalomeningitis,
      after the first township in which it was diagnosed. Hundreds of farmers and
      townsfolk across Calcutta died from the disease, whose initial symptoms included
      fever and palsy, before doctors could isolate the cause. By that point, the
      plague had spread to the other major settlements and even offworld. A treatment
      was eventually found, but only after more than a thousand colonists had perished
      and another thousand had been crippled by severe brain damage. In the days of
      the Star League, the Draconis Combine founded a medical research facility on
      the remote island continent of Cobayne, in the city of Saint Greame. The Piedmont
      Institute for Disease Control''s primary mandate was to study the dormant but
      still dangerous chungalomeningitis virus and to discover a more permanent cure
      for the disease, which continued to claim dozens of lives every year. Unfortunately,
      the Amaris coup intervened. In an effort to harness chungalomeningitis as a
      biological weapon, Amaris‘ troops stormed the PIDC and seized several containers
      of stored virus cultures, which the tattered DCMS troops onplanet attempted
      to recapture. In the battle that followed, the Usurper‘s desperate forces released
      a mutated strain of the virus. Unfortunately for both sides, the altered strain
      was even more virulent than the original, with a cycle that ran three times
      as fast. Out of control within days of its release, the plague affected nearly
      every inhabitant on Cobayne and forced the DCMS troops there to call in a nuclear
      strike on themselves. The entire continent is still a quarantine zone, forbidden
      even for inbound vessels to fly over. The blackened husk of Saint Greame and
      the PIDC are still visible, however, on orbital scans of the surface. Centuries
      later, a cure for the disease continues to elude the grasp of the PIDC‘s successors,
      including the recently established Piedmont Medical Institute, founded by the
      Republic of the Sphere in the planetary capital of Curtiss Valley on Victoria.
      However, preventative treatments have kept new cases of chungalomeningitis galaxywide
      to a mere handful each year.'
