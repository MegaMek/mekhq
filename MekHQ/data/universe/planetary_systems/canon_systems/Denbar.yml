      Denbar has been part of the Capellan Confederation for most of its history, however it was not actually settled until the early 31st Century. Comstar exploration prior to the settlement discovered the site of a lost Star League expedition from the mid-27th century. Further investigation determined that the expedition had been investigating a mysterious signal originating from the planet. Official records indicate that Denbar has never had a permanent settlement and no trace of transmission equipment was ever found. Comstar uncovered the salvageable wreckage of two large Dropships and assorted heavy machinery near the north pole, but the remains of the expedition crew were never recovered.

      The Confederation’s eventual settlement was originally little more than a permanent base for military garrison due to the planet's strategic location but population soon expanded with refugees from the 4th Succession War.
