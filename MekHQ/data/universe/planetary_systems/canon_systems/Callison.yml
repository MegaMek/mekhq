    desc: 3135 - Callison possesses abundant water, mineral, and agricultural resources.
      It was originally colonized by the Federation of Skye in the early period of
      mankind's colonization of the stars before the heavily urbanized and industrialized
      world was claimed by the Free World League during the Age of War. During the
      Star League era, Callison was a key border world and trading hub, jointly administered
      by the Free World League and the Terran Hegemony. After the Amaris Crisis and
      the collapse of the Star League, Callison reverted to full control by the Free
      World League. In 2966, Callison joined with other nearby worlds to form the
      Silver Hawks Coalition to co-ordinate defences against Lyran Commonwealth raids
      and invasions. Callison remained part of the Free World League throughout the
      Succession Wars inspite of heavy fighting that devastated many major cities
      until Lyran Commonwealth mercenaries finally seized the world with a decisive
      battle at Fallosha, the capital city during the Fourth Succession War. Operation
      Guerrero resulted in the Free World League recapturing Callison once more. When
      the Word of Blake Jihad erupted in 3067, the Free World League was initially
      spared. However, the Word of Blaket eventually attacked, and Callison suffered
      from a massed assault by mercenary â€˜Mech forces. Fortunately, Callison was spared
      the atrocities committed elsewhere and the world recovered under Republic of
      the Sphere proved easier than most.
