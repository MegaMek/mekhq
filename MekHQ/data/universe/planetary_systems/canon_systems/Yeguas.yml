      Yegaus is a comfortable planet with abundant agriculture and natural resources and even modest industry. However, despite this it has never been a prominent planet in the Lyran Commonwealth, though its location in the nation’s interior spared Yegaus the worst of the Succession Wars. The planet is best known for its ample grasslands and highly regarded breeds of Terran horses. The planet became more prominent after the Clan Invasion put the planet on the Commonwealth’s new border with the Jade Falcons.

      Laumer City is located on the continent of Saddleback and is home to Yegaus’ wealthiest merchant families. Saddleback is primarily covered in massive farmsteads that produce ‘luxury crops’ to ship off-world and is one of three continents.
