      Renamed Kooken’s Pleasure Pit in 3005, in reference to an infamous book which detailed the hedonistic life of the author, Michael Kooken, the planet was an attempt to battle organized crime in the region by providing many of the same services legally. Tourism is the planet’s only major industry and the entire economy is geared around visitors having a good time.

      The planet itself is resource poor and has little to offer for export. However, the terrain of Kooken’s Pleasure Pit is extremely varied and in places very scenic.
