    desc: 'Styx was aptly named by the first settlers to set up colonies on its storm-ravaged
      surface. Large oceans and the gravitational effects of its three moons are blamed
      for the violent storms that rage across the Stygian surface, often causing damage
      from flash floods and mudslides during the planet‘s rainy seasons. The first
      colonists, as a result, settled in the open plains of the interior regions of
      Epimethius, the primary continent, where the storms were least volatile. A few
      short years after the first towns were established, geologists discovered high
      quantities of metal and radioactive minerals in the mountain ranges of Epimethius
      and the smaller, neighboring continent of Perdition. These deposits lured in
      mining firms, the largest of which was the Styx Mining Company, an interstellar
      corporation that specialized in mining difficult veins of valuable metals and
      quality refining processes. Styx came under the sway of the Terran Hegemony
      more than a century before the birth of the Star League, and its mineral wealth
      helped bolster the Hegemony‘s economy and military. Perhaps for this reason,
      the Draconis Combine came to covet Styx, culminating in the first true battle
      to use the BattleMech. In 2443, a Combine armored company raided Styx, intending
      to seize and plunder several metal refineries on Perdition while testing the
      resolve of the Hegemony. The rain-slicked plains slowed the Kuritan tanks, which
      gave the Hegemony troops plenty of time to ready their new war machines. On
      the muddy plains outside the city of Barbados, the two forces clashed: a lance
      of Hegemony ‘Mechs against a full company of Combine tanks and infantry support.
      The results were so lopsided that few could argue the Hegemony‘s new BattleMech
      would not be the future king of the battlefield. Styx‘s mineral wealth attracted
      many raiders over the centuries, including a major engagement between Kurita
      and Davion forces over the Styx Mining Company‘s Beta facility near the city
      of Lake Wio. Despite these clashes, the Draconis Combine managed to maintain
      control over this vital if stormy world until the rise of the Republic in 3081.
      Styx remains a major exporter of metals and radioactive minerals to the Republic
      and the Combine today, with the historically pro-Combine Styx Mining Corporation
      receiving a huge subsidy from the Republic to maintain its operations under
      the new banner. The Styx Mining Corporation‘s headquarters are in Memphis, on
      Epimethius. The planetary capital, Sunder Falls, is located 120 kilometers northwest
      of Memphis. Aside from Epimethius and Perdition, Styx‘s third large landmass
      is the island continent of Gehenna. Far less populous than the other two regions,
      Gehenna is home to a large spaceport city, Lindon‘s Folly, which is also home
      to one of the Styx Mining Company‘s large refineries.'
