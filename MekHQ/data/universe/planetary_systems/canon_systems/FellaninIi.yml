    desc: 'On the surface, it defies explanation why anyone would wish to live on
      a world as inhospitable as Fallanin II. Sandstorms, blamed largely on the planet‘s
      three moons, are a common sight for this desert world, the blasted remains of
      what once may have been a paradise, but for the strike of a city-sized asteroid
      nearly two thousand years ago. Despite the hostile weather, however, a colony
      was set up on Fellanin II to exploit the planet‘s vast underground mineral and
      petroleum wealth. A few settlements sprang up in this manner, most of them underground
      colonies, which survive by tapping into the planet‘s few underground seas and
      establishing protected farms for their communities. These subsurface communities
      are connected to the domed planetary capital and spaceport city of Firstpoint
      by long, subterranean rail lines. Fallanin II features no continents as such,
      but rather five large seas, separated by rocky, sandy, vegetation-poor land.
      Firstpoint borders the largest of these, the North Sea. The planet‘s remaining
      settlements lie underground near the other four major bodies of water: the South
      Sea, the Dry Sea, Larson‘s Sea, and the Great Expanse.'
