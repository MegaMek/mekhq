      Dicallus is a comfortable planet with an agreeable climate, atmosphere and pleasant weather. The planet’s vast abundance of arable land have made it a breadbasket that exports food to many of its neighboring systems. Unfortunately, the planet is plagued by a number of cunning and deadly predators that despite centuries of trying, have resisted eradication. For protection, most natives of Dicallus keep a specially engineered breed of dog. The breed is known for its size and long life, often rivaling that of a human, and they make excellent protectors for the people of Dicallus. The planet is home to a Bowie Industries hovercraft plant located on the Weiss continent in the planetary capital, Nürnberg.
