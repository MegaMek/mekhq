      Tancredi IV was originally surveyed in 2334 but the information was overlooked for more than 30 years. Early colonists were pleasantly surprised to discover that the survey report had been quite conservative and the planet was even more hospitable than reported. With large tracts of arable land the population of Tancredi IV has never had a problem feeding itself and large deposits of minerals and ores resulted in a strong economy based on mining and the industry that sprang up around it.

      Unfortunately for the people of Tancredi, their success made the planet a tempting target during the Succession Wars. Most of the planet’s industry was destroyed during the 1st Succession War and the farm-land saw its share of damage during the 2nd and 3rd Wars. During a decade long occupation by the Combine, most of the remaining foodstuffs were exported as the spoils of war, leaving the population nearly starving. The Combine used dirty weapons when they were forced off the planet, further reducing the ability of the farms and ranches of Tancredi IV to recover.

      Since the Federated Suns reclaimed the planet in 3023, rebuilding efforts have been slow but the planet’s industry has remained somewhat strong, as many companies rebuilt underground after the 1st Succession War, sparing the industrial base significant damage after.
