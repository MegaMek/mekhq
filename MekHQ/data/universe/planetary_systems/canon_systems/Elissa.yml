      3055: Elissa was a primary holding of the Elysian Fields, a fief of the Oberon Confederation controlled by the Inheritors. Publicly the planet was reported as a backwater world that was being left largely undeveloped as a ‘nature preserve’ and the Elysian Fields agreed to provide the bandit Kingdom water in exchange for protection. However, the reality was that Elissa and the Elyssian Fields suffered under the regime. Elissa was heavily mined by the Confederation and the planet’s inhabitants were forced into poverty on the whims of the various pirates serving under Hendrik Grimm. The planet’s capture by the Clans in 3049, was actually a relief for much of the population.

      The planet was the site of the final battle between the Kell Hounds, the Thirty-First Wolf Solahma and the ‘Red Corsair’ in 3055.
