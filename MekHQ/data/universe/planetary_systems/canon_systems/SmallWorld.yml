    desc: Having only entered its current ice age about a thousand years ago, Small
      World is a cold world, where icebergs float endlessly across over two-thirds
      of the planet‘s surface, and where three of its five continents lie under expanding
      polar glaciers. The earliest expeditions to this world aimed at establishing
      settlements on the few habitable regions of the planet‘s two small equatorial
      continents of Gladstone and Motherland, when geologists discovered that a wealth
      of raw radioactive elements lay just below the surface. The Small family, after
      which the world was named, quickly capitalized on this discovery and established
      Small World as a port of call for industries in need of radioactive raw materials.
      Most of Small World‘s business, even today, comes from the mining, refining,
      and sale of radioactives and other minerals mined below its frozen lands, though
      only five major cities exist on the equatorial continents. In 3058, the Small
      family‘s dream to forge an empire was briefly realized after the breakup of
      the Federated Commonwealth, when the Duke of Small tried to seize several nearby
      worlds in a political and military campaign. These efforts broke down again
      just a few, short years later, and led to the collapse of the Small family and
      its fall from power. Aside from the cities on Gladstone and Motherland—including
      the planetary capital and port city of New Mariotta—small mining settlements
      exist on the northern continent of Everfrost, and the southern continents of
      Killingly and Hollonna.
