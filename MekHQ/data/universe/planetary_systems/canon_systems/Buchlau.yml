      3135 - Buchlau was originally a member of the Tikonov Grand Union. Buchlau's only continent, Vienna, is covered with dense jungle, with a large mountain mesa, nearly a thousand kilometers across, rising up out of the jungle in the centre of the continent. Belgrade, the capital, is located on the mesa along with a large drop-port. Vienna, is surrounded by a vast, turbulent ocean.

      The planet was settled for its ocean, some of the fish grow to the size of Terran killer whales. Buchlau started exporting its fish catch to planets like Algol, Halloran V, and Demeter.

      As Buchlau was not strategically important, it was not target for attacks during the Succession Wars until the Fourth Succession War. The Federated Suns invasion force overwhelmed the Capellan defenders. Not until the eruption and formation of the Chaos March did the Confederation consider making any moves to recover Buchlau. During the FedCom Civil War, the Maskirovka stirred up pro-Capellan sentiments. This was countered by the intuitive moves of Duke Hasek, the Capellan March Lord, who spent a sizeable part of his own personal fortune to turn that in his own favor.

      During the Jihad, the planetary governor contacted the World of Blake forces and offered to surrender the world so that it would not suffer the same fate as had Algol and Algot. The offer was accepted. Following the Jihad, untouched Buchlau has become one of the primary food-producing worlds in Prefecture V of the Republic of the Sphere.
