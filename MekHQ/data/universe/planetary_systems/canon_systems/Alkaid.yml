      3135 - Alkaid is a dry world, dominated by sun-cracked desert wastes between low plateaus and hills of eternally shifting sands. Only near the shorelines of Khalek, the large polar continent, and the nearby Hekker island chain, just south of Khalek, could life be considered comfortable. The twenty-fourth-century discovery of a host of commercially valuable chemicals and ores, just below its rocky, sandy surface led to the development of a chemical industry and a series of in-system buoys to guide traffic to and from the planet that helped bring about the first permanent settlements by the Federation of Skye.

      Moravska Ostrava, was established on the banks of Khalek‘s Novaya Minsk River delta, and is home of Toloy-Daelun Chemicals, which controls over twenty-three chemical extraction, processing, and distribution plants on Alkaid alone. Verstigrad, the planetary capital, is located almost 500 kilometers inland, on the banks of Lake Tatyanna. Alkaid has two large spaceports, one in Moravska Ostrava and one in Verstigrad. A secondary spaceport was constructed in the city of Nobadi, on the southern supercontinent of Inahalia, following the Word of Blake Jihad and the recommendation of the Lyran general in charge of the relief forces.

      During the Jihad, Word of Blake forces entered the system via pirate points and seized control of the primary spaceports on Khalek. The Lyran defenders went to ground on Inahalia instead, waging a guerilla war until reinforcements arrived to relieve them.
