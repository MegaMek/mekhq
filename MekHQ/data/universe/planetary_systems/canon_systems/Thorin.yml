    desc: 3135 - An early colony world when humanity first reached for the stars,
      almost a thousand years ago, Thorin was a beautiful, terrestrial planet, blessed
      by an abundance of resources including rich mineral deposits, immense woodlands,
      and diverse animal life. To preserve their world‘s natural beauty against possible
      contamination by corporate industrialization, the early settlers established
      planetary zoning laws that restricted heavy industries to the northern continent
      of Olympus. By contrast, the southern continent, Freda, was reserved for those
      seeking a more agrarian way of life. As a result of this charter, high-tech
      cities came to dot the Olympian shoreline and riverways by the time of the Star
      League, while large agricultural communes and logging industries formed the
      backbone of the Fredan economy. The Terran Hegemony established Thorin as a
      jewel of education and learning when they built the massive University of Thorin,
      a liberal arts school, in the Remington Valley. Located a short distance away
      from Ecol City, the planetary capital and site of the legendary Public Library
      of Thorin, the University of Thorin held to the highest academic standards of
      the day, but was destroyed along with the Library during the planet‘s occupation
      by Amaris troops. Today, only the ruins of the university in the heart of what
      is now Remington Forest, the Library Monument outside Ecol City, and the remains
      of the massive Fortress Laiacona, a partially destroyed Star League Castle Brian,
      testify to the lost treasures of the Star League. Ironically, though the University
      and the Library were destroyed during the Amaris occupation before the collapse
      of the Star League, the fortress did not meet its fate until the Word of Blake
      Jihad, when Blakist agents unleashed a tactical thermonuclear weapon against
      the command post of the planetary militia. The similar devastation wrought on
      many of Thorin‘s Olympus cities forced much of the surviving population to relocate
      off-world or to Freda, which survived unscathed through two of the worst military
      campaigns to darken human history. Today, even though the majority of Thorin‘s
      population now lives on the more habitable continent of Freda or in small mining
      habitats in the system‘s asteroid field, and though most business is now conducted
      in the Fredan city of Port Sumpter, Ecol City on Olympus remains the planetary
      capital.
