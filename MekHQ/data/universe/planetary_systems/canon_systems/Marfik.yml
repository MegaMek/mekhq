      3135 - Though it orbits far from its white-hot parent star, summers on Marfik are hot indeed. Part of this oppressive climate is due, of course, to the thin atmosphere, and nearly nonexistent ozone layer, which fails to protect this planet adequately against harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays. For this reason, early settlers quickly established most of their colonies below ground, or under protective domes. Though native flora already existed, imported plants were also introduced in an effort to thicken and purify the air, supplemented by atmospheric processors built later on. Unfortunately, the constant fighting for this border world, which boasts veins of valuable metals, including germanium and titanium, set back such efforts again and again through the centuries. Nevertheless, in the Star League era, terraforming efforts had begun to bear fruit, allowing the people of this world to step outside without the aid of filter masks or thick sunscreens.

      Unfortunately, the loss of the Star League–era atmospheric purifiers during the early years of the Succession Wars initiated a gradual downward spiral as the planet reverts to its native atmosphere. Even under the rule of The Republic of the Sphere, in the wake of the Jihad, the quality of life on Marfik has steadily continued to decline, leading many among the native government and populace to wonder if they will someday have to abandon their world. Today, as in the beginning, the majority of the planet‘s cities lie underground or beneath reflective domes, and travel on the surface without the aid of a filter mask and special reflective environment suits—dubbed “mirrorware” by the locals—is not recommended.The planetary capital city and largest spaceport, Turkestgard, is located on the northern continent of Yantiban. Secondary spaceports may also be found in Kirikut and Halifax, the largest cities on the continents North Galfree and South Galfree, respectively.
