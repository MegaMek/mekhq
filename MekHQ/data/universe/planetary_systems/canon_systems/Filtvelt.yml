      Filtvelt is a relatively unremarkable planet located in the Outback of the Federated Suns. At least until February 20, 3072 when the Filtvelt Coalition declared its independence from the Suns due to negligence during the Word of Blake Jihad. Other than lower than standard gravity, Filtvelt is a comfortable temperate planet with fertile soil and long growing seasons which makes it an ideal breadbasket planet that supplies food to neighboring systems. Filtvelt has modest natural resources and industry, including a Cal-Boeing of Dorwinion plant that produces conventional aircraft and the Coalition Armory, a small facility that originally did just repair and refit work, it was retooled by the Filtvelt Coalition to create primitive BattleMechs.

      3080 - While Filtvelt has only one true continent, Hurum, there are a number of islands, including the coastal islands of Buskerud, Fyr and Olav-toppen, which are home to much of the planet’s agriculture because they are sheltered from the planet’s predators like the deadly thunderbeast.

      Filtvelt is home to the Coalition Armory Incorporated, a refit yard that was upgraded during the Word of Blake Jihad to produce primitive BattleMechs and is located in the mountain town of Sor-Jan. The older Cal-Boeing of Dorwinion plant that produces conventional aircraft and VTOLs, is located in the industrial heart of the city of Olafberg. The Filtvelt Academy, located in the planetary capital of Underdal, provides training for MechWarriors, Aerospace pilots, vehicle crews, VTOL pilots and unarmored-infantry.
