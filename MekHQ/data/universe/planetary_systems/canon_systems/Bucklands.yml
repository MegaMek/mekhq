      Bucklands is breadbasket world that supplies massive amounts of food to neighboring planets. The food supplies make the planet vital to the region, even if Bucklands is regarded as a backwater planet by most Lyrans. The planet is otherwise not noteworthy, with next to no industry beyond food processing and packaging and only modest deposits of common mineral resources.

      Nearly 80% of the planet’s population belong to ‘farming clans’, which often wrangle for the best farmlands and during harvests. In order to avoid damaging the crops and fields, the people of Bucklands solve these conflicts, when negotiations fail, with AgroMech duels’ conducted by the farming clans’’ security forces. Unlike many systems that would record and broadcast these sorts of fights, the duels on Bucklands garner little interest, due to the use of non-BattleMechs.

      The children of Bucklands tend to view their planet as boring and the majority seek to escape the ‘slow life’ by joining the Lyran Military once they come of age. However, many of the wayward sons and daughters of Bucklands end up returning after a few tours. Bucklands is home to a prominent retired veterans social club for those that became MechWarriors, which has chapters in almost every settlement on planet.
