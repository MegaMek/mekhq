    desc: Lapida II is a heavily industrialized and resource rich world in the Proserpina
      Prefecture of the Benjamin Military District. The planet is cold and has an
      atmosphere tainted by hundreds of years of strip mining and industry. The city
      of Mulifanua on the continent of Upolu is home to Nimakachi Fusion Products.
      Nimakachi Fusion Products purchased the bankrupt Sendai mining complex in 2602.
      They transformed the subterranean complex into a self-contained manufacturing
      enclave. The fact that the area surrounding the factories is covered with a
      warren of shantytowns creating heavy urban environments that are nearly impossible
      to fight through have been vital to Nimakachiâ€™s defense, along with their highly
      experienced and well equipped security force, combined the facility is almost
      impossible to raid. Also on world are numerous mineral processing and construction
      factories that produce everything from furniture, to tractors, to BattleMechs.
      The continent of Firesand is home to several well-hidden refit and supply centers.
      The continent received its name from the corrosive and toxic ammoniac salt sands
      that cover most of Firesand.
