      Babylon is an arid planet that originally did not appeal to early colonists. Not only was it a harsh climate, many early colonists suffered from the "Babylon Plague" caused by native pathogens. Thousands perished in the months before scientists were able to come up with an effective vaccine.

      After the world was made more liveable and the Plague was conquered, it was discovered that Babylon was rich in raw minerals. This extended to other planets in the system and several large asteroids.

      Babylon is home to the Goliath Scorpion, which were a bane of early settlers.
