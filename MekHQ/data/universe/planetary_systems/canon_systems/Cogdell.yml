    desc: Cogdell was originally ‘settled’ when a group of convicts from the Periphery
      were dumped on the planet without supplies. The prisoners managed to scrape
      together a semi-anarchic society with no real structure. When the planet was
      absorbed by the Federated Suns prior to the 3rd Succession War the Davion government
      appointed the governor from the people on the planet, selecting a member of
      the well-known Sims family. However, as the years passed the Simms family became
      more pro-Suns and and pro-Nobility, this has unfortunately caused major problems
      on the planet as the citizens want to maintain the status quo of semi-anarchy.
