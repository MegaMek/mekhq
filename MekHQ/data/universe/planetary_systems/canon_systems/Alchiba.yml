      3135 - Alchiba is a warm world orbiting a harsh, bright yellow, sub-dwarf star. The planet's axial tilt is synchronized with its rotation and orbit so that the northern hemisphere receives less direct sunlight than the southern hemisphere and equatorial reaches. Havenri, the northern polar continent, and its surrounding island chains have been blessed with rich soils and a temperate climate that is well suited for agriculture. The three southern continents, Frome, Nakkara, and Priez, are largely dominated by deserts and barren mountains. Settlers thus developed much of Havenri for habitation and agriculture, while the southern continents host limited mining and ore-refining industries of common and industrial metals. The agricultural and light machine products trade flows through the planetary capital and port city of Fairweather, on Havenri.

      During the Star League era, Alchiba was jointly administered by the Lyran Commonwealth and the Terran Hegemony, serving as a trading post. Amaris' troops to largely ignore the planet and left it to the Lyran Commonwealth due to its lack of heavy military industries. During the Succession Wars, Alchiba was the target of the odd raid launched by the Free World League or the Draconis Combine. During the Jihad, the Word of Blake ignored this world completely. As a result, The Republic of the Sphere inherited a remarkably undamaged world.
