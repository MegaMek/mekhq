    desc: Cylene‘s eccentric orbit is largely attributed to the imbalance caused by
      the shattering of its large moon into three smaller satellites roughly eighty
      thousand years ago, likely by a large rogue asteroid or comet. As a result,
      the planet is currently entering into what many believe to be the beginnings
      of an ice age, with temperatures near freezing even at the equator during the
      winter months. This, as much as the damage done during the first two Succession
      Wars (particularly between the Draconis Combine and the Federated Suns), has
      resulted in the gradual, but steady emigration of the population to other, more
      hospitable and safe worlds nearby. Ruins of cities destroyed or abandoned in
      the early wars still dot the landscape of the northern continent. Only the large
      deposits of industrial-grade metal ore, discovered close to the planet surface
      and churned up by the planet‘s occasionally overactive geology, has kept people
      around and employed. The planet‘s main continents are the largely unpopulated
      Graus, in the north, Clytemnestra in the south, and Absalom, a large landmass
      that practically rings the entire equatorial region and is home to the planetary
      capital of Halcyon.
