    desc: Defiance is a temperate planet with a tainted atmosphere that was originally
      settled as a mining colony. Unfortunately, years of mining have worsened the
      atmosphere and removed almost all of the of the valuable materials the planet
      once contained. Now, Defiance is a sleepy backwater and the planet’s biggest
      claim to fame is the Defiance Combat Training Center. The planet has only light
      industry and requires imported food to support its population and any military
      units rotating through to make use of the Training Center.
