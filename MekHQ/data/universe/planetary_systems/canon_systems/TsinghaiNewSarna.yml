      Tsinghai, formerly New Sarna, was originally a provincial capital in the old Sarna Supremacy. With the formation of the Capellan Confederation, Tsinghai transitioned to a economy based on mining and grew to become a regional exporter of uranium and other fissionable materials. As the Succession Wars dragged on Tsinghai slowly became a planet-wide industrial complex as Sarna's commercial activities relocated here for protection. It is a modest planet with a temperate climate and is known primarily for its excellent wines.

      Tsinghai has repelled numerous Marik and bandit attacks that have decimated the population of this formerly thriving planet. Tsinghai industrial importance has been reduced but it is located in a strategic position, so the planet is garrisoned by a regiment of Sian reserves to discourage further raiding.
