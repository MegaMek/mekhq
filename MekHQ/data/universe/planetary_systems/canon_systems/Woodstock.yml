      3135 - Woodstock was colonised during the latter half of the 22nd century by refugees from the Terran North American continent. Woodstock is a temperate world devoted to raising agricultural products and a variety of livestock. The three oceans are as rich and vibrant with life, while the land is fertile.

      Recital City is the planetary capital and is located on Sjardijin, the smallest of the three continents. The Terran Hegemony and the Star League set up an agricultural research station on Sjardijin that undertook research to improve crop efficiency to feed the many worlds in the former Hegemony. It was rumored that Star League scientists discovered a new method that would advance the science of pest control. This was confirmed during the Fourth Succession War when Federated Suns units liberated Woodstock. York, the largest continent, produces most of the beef and grows some tobacco for cigars.

      Woodstock‘s third continent, Essex, is the only blemish on this otherwise beautiful world. During Amaris' occupation of the Hegemony, Woodstock was attacked by elements of the 141st Amaris Dragoons, using chemical and nuclear weapons to target the military base located on Essex, obliterating the SLDF garrison. The weapons poisoned Essex, rendering the continent all but uninhabitable. The continent is now used in studying radiation‘s effect on the environment.
