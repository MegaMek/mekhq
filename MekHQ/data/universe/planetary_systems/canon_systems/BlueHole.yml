      Blue Hole is covered in unique lakes and rivers that dot the land and are visible from space. From the ground, these lakes and rivers are even more unique for their massive depths and the fact that many of them are connected by large underground rivers. Often these underground channels are large enough for submersibles and even ‘Mechs to pass through.

      Since colonization, Blue Hole has exported water as a main industry due to its abundance of clean, drinkable water. The abundance of water has also made Blue Hole a vacation get away for most of its history, only losing visitors after the Clan Invasion left Blue Hole on the border.
