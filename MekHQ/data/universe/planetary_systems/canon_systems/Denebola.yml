      3135 - Denebola V, also known as Everwood or Lyracropis, is a cool world with untouched woodlands covering almost eighty percent of its equatorial and tropical zones. Three large landmasses straddle these regions, Neurasia, Zadipos, and Slovakia. Most of the population live in cities sited along the winding rivers that cut through the forested lands. The northern and southern regions, are virtually devoid of life, as polar caps extend well into the temperate zones. Denebola was the first of the early Terran colonies to declare its independence from the Alliance, before becoming part of the Terran Hegemony. After the fall of the Star League, Denebola, due to its position on the border of the Lyran Commonwealth and the Free Worlds League, changed ownership a number of times through the centuries.

      The influx of off-world immigrants with each change of ownership, mixed with the planet's past, has resulted in a cosmopolitan melting pot that made Denebola an ideal choice for a Prefecture capital when it became part of The Republic of the Sphere. Fallen Star, the continental capital of Zadipos, is nestled on the western coast and is home to a thriving fishing community and regional defense post. New Bonn covers the entire northern edge of the large inland Lake Diamond on Neurasia, and maintains several prime logging and farming industries. The official planetary capital, St. Cameron, is located on the eastern Rhyde Peninsula of Slovakia, and is home not only to Denebolaâ€˜s largest spaceport, but also the Prefecture capital building and headquarters of the planetary militia.
