      Settled in the early 31st Century, Caleno is a warm temperate world. Due to the discovery of a hidden Star League facility in 3019, it is hard to determine the level of native species on planet. The hidden Star League Facility allowed the Concordat to rediscover and begin construction on some Lostech military equipment.

      3080: Celano was not colonized until the turn of the 31st century and typifies the ‘standard’ Periphery planet. The mostly temperate planet has ample water, however most of the planet is uninhabited and natives struggle at subsistence, especially on the deadly storm-swept plains of Whirlstorm. Celano was settled by the Taurian Concordat and was an unremarkable planet that primarily relied on agriculture until 3019 when a farmer unearthed an ancient Star League cache. The find allowed for the Concordat to gain a modest technological increase that they covered with wild rumors pointing to other locations, the true benefits were not known outside of the Concordat until the 3050s, when the Successor States had already recovered better technology. Celano is home to a modest factory based on the original Star League Cache. The plant began as LosTech Inc., which was primarily focused on selling off the parts from the cache and manufacturing additional parts for the Maultier Hovercraft. When LosTech Inc. went out of business, outside funding saw the plant change hands to Edge Industries. The plant primarily constructs standard, ferro-fibrous and ferro-alluminum armors, streak SRM launchers and ammunition, as well as other weapons and munitions for combat vehicles. The LosTech plant is located in the small wooded town of Edgewood on the Aquila continent.
