      3025: Yunnah contains vast deposits of natural resources in the large mountain ranges that cover most of the planet’s land mass, however there have been few attempts to mine them and Yunnah was barely populated for most of its history. This changed in the early 31st Century when the Capellan Confederation established a large medical facility to heal injured soldiers and a massive repair and recovery facility to repair damaged war-materials. Yunnah possesses just enough agriculture to feeds its population. Some seafaring activity exists as part of a quasi-religious movement based on spiritual harmony with the elements.

      3085: Yunnah is an unremarkable world with almost no industry, limited natural resources and only enough agriculture to feed its own population. Additionally, the planet is only sparsely inhabited and has almost no native industry, as a result requires imports for almost all goods. The planet is primarily utilized for training and large-scale combat maneuvers by the Capellan Confederation. Yunnah is also home to one of many Duchy RTC training facilities and specializes in training infantry and vehicle crews.
