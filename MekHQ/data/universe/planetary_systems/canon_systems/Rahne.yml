      Rahne is a small planet with very little arable land, an extremely short growing season and scarce water. To make matters worse the planet is constantly assailed by massive dust storms, which have greatly hampered efforts to tap into the mineral wealth available near the surface of the planet. The extreme weather on Rahne is caused by its massive moon Caliban, which is nearly as large as Rahne.

      Rahne has four seasons, Storm, Calm, Cold, and Melting, each of which lasts only 21 days. During the Melting season, temperatures often rise above 100 degrees celsius, making it the most dangerous of the four seasons. The extreme weather means that all human dwellings are underground and only during the Calm and Cold seasons can humans survive outside.

      Even with its extreme weather, Rahne does support native life. A prime example is the ill-tempered Toad-Fox, a deadly predator with red fur and poisonous claws. The beast comes out at night during the Storm and Calm seasons to hunt, mates during the Cold season and spends the Warm season they birth their young in burrows they dig into mountains with their massive claws.
