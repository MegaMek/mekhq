    desc: Gulf Breeze is originally known as Commonwealth Mining Outpost 26 (C.M.O.26).
      The focus of this mining operation was a large, lifeless, tide-locked planet.
      The planet is abundant with elements such as titanium, platinum and many more
      with a wide range of uses in the industrial world. The world’s chief mining
      operation is a mining colony located on the night side of the planet, housed
      in domed settlements. Space borne habitats exist throughout the system, aiding
      in the extraction of valuable materials on outer planets, moons and asteroid
      fields. Gulf Breeze Station is a major waypoint for all in system travel and
      serves as the system capital. A space station massing 930,000 tons and of Star
      League-era design, Gulf Breeze Station is capable of sustaining a population
      of 50,000. The Gulf Breeze system was originally founded by the Commonwealth
      Mining Corporation.  With the fall of CMC the colonists decided to stay and
      make a living trading mined resources to keep the colony thriving, naming the
      system for their station.
