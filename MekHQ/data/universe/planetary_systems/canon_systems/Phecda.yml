    desc: 3135 - Though blessed by an abundance of surface water, the fact that much
      of it is trapped beneath its growing polar caps (Phecda is entering an ice age,
      thanks to a slight elongation in its orbit) limited the early settlers‘ ability
      to exploit this world effectively. In fact, most colonies and cities on Phecda
      were established on the smattering of islands surrounding Gamurmaj, the only
      one of its three large landmasses stable enough and warm enough to support hospitable
      settlements. Lacking in significant material resources, this world has always
      relied on trade with its neighbors for everything from farming machinery and
      ranching cattle to industrial construction equipment and spacecraft parts. The
      great distance between the planet and its jump point, however, hindered trade
      for many years, particularly during times of war. To remedy the situation somewhat,
      four mid-range stations were placed in the Phecda system during the Star League
      era, but none of these survived the collapse of the League and the centuries
      of war that came after. Raiders, drawn by the local production of water purifiers,
      or sent as a diversion for other assaults against more valuable targets on the
      Steiner border, gradually decimated the planet‘s single major export industry.
      The constant depredations led to the formation of several local aerospace defense
      squadrons over the centuries, as it became clear that the long in-system flight
      offered the planet‘s greatest defense against raiders by permitting interception
      of inbound traffic. By the end of the Succession Wars, however, Phecda had become
      little more than an outpost world, a well-populated backwater on a hostile border.
      Only its location made it worthy of a spirited defense. Today, Phecda is a quiet
      world whose people specialize in exporting common luxuries, basic metals, and
      small-scale purifiers to their neighbors in nearby star systems. The planet‘s
      largest city and only spaceport, Atlantic Coast, is located on the southeastern
      shores of Gamurmaj. Travelers interested in visiting the islands around Gamurmaj
      or the isolated communities of the northern continents, Kuld and Phreezi, must
      often rely on the seagoing ice ships that provide for much of the planet‘s intercontinental
      transport.
