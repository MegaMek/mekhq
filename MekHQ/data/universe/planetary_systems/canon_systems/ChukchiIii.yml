      Chukchi III remained a relatively backwater planet for most of its history, full of picturesque green valleys and snow capped mountains. This changed in the early 31st Century with the discovery of massive deposits of Titanium in the planet. As a result there was a period of rapid industrialization of the planet in order to fully exploit the titanium. This unfortunately resulted in the destruction of much of the planet’s picturesque wilderness and the rapid growth also introduced organized crime to Chukchi III.

      This led to a very hostile environment by the mid 3020s with many residents just short of rebellion against the planetary President’s support of the rapid growth. The planetary Duke was forced to step in to try to curb the rampant and uncontrolled industrial growth.

      3080 - Chukchi III became heavily industrialized after the discovery of titanium in the planet’s crust. The Maxell Metals, Incorporated plants already on planet, responsible for creating the highly sought Maxell Lasers, expanded to include BattleMech production after the titanium was discovered. Unfortunately, the planet has suffered significant unrest starting after the Clan Invasion. The planet is locked in a three-way battle between organized crime, industry and eco-terrorists. The organized crime comes from the Malthus Syndicate, which became heavily involved on Chukchi III after the Clan Invasion lost the syndicate Dustball, their previous base of operations. The Syndicate is always trying to find more ways to increase their revenue, often clashing with Maxell Industries. The third combatants are ‘eco-terrorists’ driven to drastic actions due to the damage that the expanded industry and strip-mining have begun to cause to the planet.
