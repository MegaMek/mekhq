      The original capital of the Lyran Commonwealth, Arcturus was a thriving world with bustling and ornate cities. However, when the capital was relocated to Tharkad, taking the government of the Commonwealth along with it, the remaining population of Arcturus moved out of the cities and into the countryside. The only remaining industrial city is Malcheema.

      Arcturus’ greatest contribution to the Commonwealth since the capital became Tharkad has been the 9 Arcturan Guards regiments. While the regiments are filled from men and women throughout the Commonwealth, at all times at least 25% of the postings must be from Arcturus.

      Despite a comfortable mild-temperate climate, the planet Arcturus is unable to sustain enough agriculture to feed its population and is forced to rely on imports from other planets. Additionally, over the years, the planet's natural resources have dwindled and before the collapse of the Star League, most industry on planet already relied on imported resources. The planet was home to the massive Arcturan Arms Manufacturing Center which suffered damage during the Succession Wars to the point where all that remained functional were the small refit center used by the local garrisons. The Word of Blake Jihad sparked a rebirth of the facility and by 3080 the facility was producing 'Mechs, combat vehicles and aerospace fighters.
