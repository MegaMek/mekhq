      Despite being a barely habitable-rock, Halfway is home to a primitive native fern-like plant, which colonists discovered gave way easily to non-native plants and resulted in the planet have considerable arable land and able to support significant agriculture, despite the thin atmosphere and cold temperatures. For most of its history, Halfway has been a stop off point for travels through the Lyran Commonwealth. The planetary capital Torrence is located on the Gespar continent, which is dominated by rolling plains. There is a small Arcturan Arms combat vehicle manufacturing plant located in the ‘Baldic Barony’ located in the Baldic Island Chain.

      In the late 3070s Clan Diamond Shark was granted an enclave on the planet of Halfway and they used this as a way-station for trade as far into the Inner Sphere as Sian.
