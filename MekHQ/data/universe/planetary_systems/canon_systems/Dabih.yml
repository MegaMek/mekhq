    desc: Another of the so-called Azami worlds, Dabih was settled by pilgrims of
      the Muslim faith, who were drawn to the planet‘s lush forests and large, deep
      oceans. Shortly after the discovery of the planet, however, came the equally
      welcome revelation that its large, innermost moon, Shakhi, was also suitable
      for colonization, possessing a breathable—if thin—atmosphere and enough free-standing
      water to sustain a limited ecosystem. Finding themselves gifted with two worlds
      for the price of one, the Azami settled Dabih and Shakhi with equal determination.
      As Shakhi‘s delicate environment could not support more than a basic agricultural
      industry, the newborn Dabih planetary leadership decreed the moon would be the
      planet‘s ―breadbasket. This freed the planetary-based industries to use more
      land and resources for heavy manufacturing and mining ventures. Unfortunately,
      neither plan turned out well. Shakhi‘s soil proved difficult to work and could
      support only a few grain crops without extensive bioengineering, while many
      of Dabih‘s valuable veins of metals and chemicals lay deep within the planet‘s
      crust, requiring extreme efforts to locate and exploit. Almost a century after
      the first cities appeared, however, Dabih‘s luck changed when a vast, rich vein
      of crude oil was discovered beneath the frozen lands of Garalash, the southern
      polar continent. Natural gas pockets, located by offshore mining operations,
      soon gave the planet a major resource for use in trade with other worlds. By
      the 26th century, Dabih had become a major exporter of refined hydrocarbon fuels,
      for use in everything from small power generators to heavy aircraft engines.
      Shakhi, meanwhile, had stagnated, a world of rugged prairies and sparse farmlands,
      used mainly as a way station between the planet and its jump point. Defending
      forces assigned to Dabih used the lunar surface as a base of operations for
      their aerospace elements, a strategy that helped thwart many raids and attempted
      invasions during the Succession Wars. It even helped the local Azami resist
      the Combine leadership‘s efforts to rein in their culture. Today, Dabih remains
      the economic and industrial core of the two-world microcosm, with Shakhi as
      its quiet guardian overhead. The capital for both worlds is Barheilabad, located
      on the equatorial continent of Zairikesh on Dabih. Dabih is also home to the
      primary commercial spaceport city of Kentiles, on the eastern coast of the northern
      Ludesi continent, the third of Dabih‘s major landmasses. Shakhi, with far less
      water than Dabih, is home to the military settlement of Garhenna, on the northern
      lunar continent of North Shakhiseh. Farmlands dominate much of the southern
      lunar continent, Jidharo.
