      3060: Zaurak is a desert planet originally colonized by the Sarna Supremacy prior to the formation of the Star League. The hot, dry planet was colonized to take advantage of the abundant deposits of rare raw minerals and petroleum. Mining, extracting and refining remain the three biggest industries on Zaurak to this day. The climate is unsuitable to agriculture and as a result the planet is forced to primarily rely on imported food to sustain its population.

      Zaurak was raided multiple times during the Succession Wars but avoided serious damage, the worst damage to the planet came from the loss of the purification plants due to age and the general decline of technology. Most of the water on Zaurak is below the surface but suffers from heavy metal poisoning, without the purifiers the planet’s population required imported water. The Federated Commonwealth was able to restore the old purifiers in 3048 due largely to the advanced uncovered from the Helm Memory Core. Zaurak found itself bereft of the Federated Commonwealth’s central government after the Lyran Alliance split off and Operation Guerrero sent the entire region into chaos. Zaurak eventually rejoined the Capellan Confederation in the early 3060s.

      Zaurak has 30 hour days and orbits its sun every 214 standard days.
