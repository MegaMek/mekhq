      As of 3025 Menke is the perpetual holding of the McCarron family and the planet serves as the home base of McCarron's Armored Cavalry. Menke is part of the Duchy of Mitchel in the Capellan Confederation. Menke is a sunny, tropical planet and boasts a large civilian population that serves as a recruitment pool for the Cavalry. Menke has extensive â€˜Mech repair facilities and one of the greatest concentrations of trained techs in the Confederation. The planet's southern hemisphere hosts a jungle warfare training center. One or more of the Armored Cavalry regiments are on planet at any specific time making the planet an uninviting target.

      Menke is home to significant industrial concerns, including Ceres Metals, which produces tanks in the capital of Archibald, Menke Armor and Armaments, which is also located in Archibald and produces numerous weapon systems, and Starcorps Industries which produces BattleMechs. Starcorps facilities are located both in the capital and in space at the L2 point. Menke is also home to one of the Confederation's many Duchy RTC training facilities, which specializes in training infantry and armor crews.
