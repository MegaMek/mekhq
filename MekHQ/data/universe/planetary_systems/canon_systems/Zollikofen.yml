    desc: 3135 - Zollikofen, sometimes nicknamed “treasure planet” is perhaps one
      of the great oddities of the Inner Sphere. Like many of the better colonies
      discovered early on in mankind‘s exodus into space, Zollikofen was blessed with
      an abundant water supply, fertile soil, and a thriving ecosystem that could
      easily support a fledgling colony. In addition, the world also boasted as many
      rich veins of precious metals such as gold, platinum, and silver, as it did
      common ores like iron and copper. Indeed, such valuable minerals proved so common
      to Zollikofen miners that the planet‘s economy was soon based on uranium and
      germanium deposits, as they were the rarer native metals, and a thriving export
      industry quickly rose based on handcrafted items of pure gold and silver. The
      Terran Hegemony managed to stake a claim in Zollikofen before the Lyrans could,
      keeping this remarkable find in the hands of the House of Cameron for many years
      under the Star League. This factor also contributed to the establishment of
      a Star League mint, which produced Lyran currency in Trader‘s City, one of the
      larger metropolii on the planet‘s single supercontinent of Besitzland, as well
      as the SLDF‘s Lyran Command headquarters. Miraculously enough, during the Amaris
      Crisis, the Usurper‘s troops did not harm the mint in Trader‘s City, though
      they did loot many of the press works and spaceport warehouses nearby. Indeed,
      the mercenaries hired by Amaris to secure this world focused almost exclusively
      on eliminating the Lyran Command forces instead, and securing several of the
      larger mines in a much more professional—if still undeniably greedy—strategy.
      After the fall of the League, Zollikofen came into Lyran hands, but the Star
      League mint was destroyed soon after, during the outbreak of the First Succession
      War, when House Kurita troops sacked the planet and resorted to nuclear and
      orbital bombardment to shatter Lyran resistance. For this reason, more than
      the gradual depletion of the gold and silver mines over the centuries, much
      of Zollikofen‘s wealth and prestige has tarnished since those glory days. Today,
      in fact, much of the planet‘s wealth now lies more in industrial metals such
      as titanium, vanadium, and bauxite, than in precious metals drawn from contaminated
      or dried-up mines elsewhere. Despite this, the world of Zollikofen still occasionally
      experiences the odd “gold rush” when new veins are uncovered, but after nearly
      a millennium of mining and radiation poisoning, most of the really good veins
      have long since been tapped out or rendered useless. The capital of Zollikofen
      today is the city of Fulbright, located on the banks of the Platin River. This
      megalopolis of over two million residents is also home to the planet‘s primary
      spaceport and the corporate headquarters of three major local mining concerns—Gershwin
      Mining Collective, Dahler Valley Resources, and Rosamund Minerals, Unlimited.
