    desc: Kirklin is a cool-temperate planet with a low-pressure atmosphere and only
      3/4 of the gravity on Terra. However, the planet was settled to take advantage
      of its abundant resources and the planet being habitable, if not entirely comfortable,
      was an added bonus. Kirklin is able to support enough agriculture to feed the
      planet's population. The mining and refining operations on Kirklin also attracted
      manufacturing and industry, including a Kallon Industries combat vehicle factory.
