    desc: 3135 - Large, dry, and devastated, Altair is only now beginning to recover
      from the horrors of one of the worst atrocities committed during the Blakist
      Jihad. Already plagued by frequent communications blackouts, caused by the planet‘s
      inexplicably unstable sun, and with few free water sources to speak of, the
      planet became a living hell when Blakist forces targeted it as part of their
      effort to establish a buffer zone around Terra. Using nuclear and biochemical
      weapons, directed at the defending Combine forces and civilian populace respectively,
      the assault claimed the lives of nearly a billion inhabitants and poisoned the
      air and water table. Once a fairly prosperous, if desolate, mining world, and
      home to the famous Long Life medical company, Altair was brought perilously
      close to becoming an uninhabitable rock. Today, saved only by the grace of Devlin
      Stone‘s ambitious resettlement programs, Altair maintains a subsistence-level
      economy, and its inhabitants cluster around the planet‘s two largest surviving
      settlements, Hehiro City and Bonanza, both of which lie along the veins of Altair‘s
      two remaining unspoiled underground rivers. Bonanza, the home of the Long Life
      Company, is located along the northern Sargasso River Vein, while Hehiro City,
      the planetary capital since the deadly biochemical attacks on Smart Alice Springs
      and Basin Flat, is situated on the southern Jumanni Delta Vein. Travel between
      these cities is treacherous, as the few usable routes pass close to radioactive
      “hot zones.” The New South Trading Company, Altair‘s single most successful
      mining, refining, and distribution company, is also based in Hehiro City, in
      the converted facilities of the Kurita Combine Munitions Corporation, a military
      aerospace firm that vacated Altair during the transition from Combine ownership
      to Stone‘s new Republic.
