      A prefecture capital in the Benjamin Military district, Algedi is a barren arid world with no true night. The sun is so large that it takes up a full third of the sky during the day. Settled by the Azami long ago, who are a very independent people, this often leads to clashes between their ways and those of the Combine. The Azami very reluctantly allow Non‐Azami to enter their “Desert Paradise.” The Azami of the world have an unnatural fear of the dark because of the planets permanent daylight. Imported life‐forms adapted to desert life are flourishing on the planet. Asketen Sand Walkers and Terran Burros are commonly seen grazing on tough grasses and cacti. Efficiency on this world is very poor; only the Azami seem to have adjusted. Other people not accustomed to the planet seem to suffer from broken biological clocks. Although an important
      Industrial, Command and logistical world, paperwork in this planet and its prefecture is in a perpetual snarl.
