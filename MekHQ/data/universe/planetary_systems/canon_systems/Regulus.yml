      Regulus originally belonged to the Selaj family, until their attempts to kill off the entire Marik line resulted in the Selaj familyâ€™s fall from power and expulsion from the Free Worlds League. While the Selaj are gone, their influence remains in the Indian styled architecture that dominates most of the cities on Regulus. Even with the seditious Selaj family removed, Regulus, as the capital of the Principality of Regulus has long been a thorn in the side of the Free Worlds League and the leading Mariks. Regulus is content to enjoy the benefits of being part of the League but is often unwilling or slow to respond to calls for support from the rest of the League.

      Trade is the primary industry on Regulus and the planet is a well known trade-port in League space. Aside from the typical trade of goods and services, Regulus is famous for its contributions to entertainment in the Free Worlds League. The planet is a major producer of Holovids and music, which finds its way all throughout League space and into surrounding realms.
