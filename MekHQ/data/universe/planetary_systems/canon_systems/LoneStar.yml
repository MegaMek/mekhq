      The Terran Hegemony spent more than a century terraforming Lone Star for inhabitation in 2533. A process made more challenging due to the planet’s distance from its sun and a thin, nitrogenous atmosphere and the movement of a local astroid into the planet’s orbit to act as a moon for mining and to host a skyhook.

      However, the efforts were extremely successful and within 70 years Lone Star was flourishing. The planet was home to hundreds of millions, industry was booming, and it had more than enough agriculture to feed its population and export a wide range of luxury foods.

      Lone Star technically has five linked continents which follow the prime meridian around the poles, however, residents started to refer to them simply as “The Belt” and that was the only name that stuck.

      While terraformed, most of the planet’s free water was concentrated in two highly saline oceans, Big Pond and Other Pond, that were roughly circular and situated antipodal in the eastern and western hemispheres. The majority of the planet’s freshwater was locked in the massive polar ice caps, with the areas between poles being predominantly arid.

      Despite the prominent amount of arid land, there were still large regions with comfortable climates and settlements naturally congregated to these locations in nine major metropolitan regions. Eight of these cities were evenly split between the northern and southern coasts of both ‘ponds’. The cities and surrounding regions remained temperate year round thanks to the oceans and had ample freshwater from ice cap fed rivers and ocean-driven precipitation.

      Driven by strict government zoning, no suburbs ever materialized and immediately outside of the bustling metropolises land immediately turned to agriculture or nature preserves. The immense tidal swells of the ‘ponds’ required each of the eight cities to be built highly raised above ground level or on natural high ground, such as the case with Cliffside, where much of the city was built into and out of the granite cliff face it was situated on.

      The ninth and final megacity was also the capital, Volgadon. The capital was situated between both oceans and was surrounded by two major polar rivers, which drained into Big Pond and Other Pond. The city itself was built on a massive, complex canal-and-lock system that linked both rivers and effectively both oceans.

      Lone Star remained a gem of the Terran Hegemony until both fell alongside the Star League. There was fierce fighting between Stefan Amaris’ forces and the Star League the devastated cities and Volgadon in particular. The planet’s industry was shattered in the civil war and the planet lost its HPG, Zenith and Nadir recharge stations, and the plants maintaining its pleasant atmosphere were damaged. They continued to break down in the proceeding years and were destroyed completely by 2803. Without the atmospheric processors, the planet’s pleasant average 22 degrees celsius at the equator dropped to -5 by 2822.

      While the air was still breathable, the planet is locked in ice and uninhabited by the end of the 2nd Succession War.
