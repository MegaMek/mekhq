      Castile is a fertile planet with abundant natural resources located in the deep Periphery. While industry is scarce in the deep Periphery, Castile is home to the King Dumount Defense Facility, located in the Domount Valley of the Iberia continent, the KDDF produces multiple unit types, including combat vehicles, conventional fighters and primitive BattleMechs. Castile is also home to the Royals Refit and Repair Station, located in the town of Real in the Détente Mountains of Barthelona, the facility is capable of repairing or refiting ‘Mechs and Aerospace fighters, though most of the refits are to downgrade units to the reduced tech available this far into the deep Periphery.
