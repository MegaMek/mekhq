      During humanities rush to colonize the stars, some colonization corporations realized that marketing was more important than solid facts. Promised Land had its name selected entirely to attract new colonists and sell land. The planet was touted for its large size and abundance of land and water, the clean air and moderate temperatures, and good soil.

      The marketing campaign forgot to mention that there were fewer areas with moderate temperature and good soil on the massive planet than on Earth. Or that much of the abundant water was highly salinated. The ads also failed to mention the extremely high gravity, almost double that on Earth. There were very narrow temperate zones, with massive desserts between. There was also the problem of native life that required vaccines, anti-allergy medication to fight the smaller-scale life forms, and for the larger and more aggressive and intelligent, possibly body armor and weapons training.
