      The tropical world of Sonnia was originally settled in the early 27th century as a resort world by Tikonov aristocracy. However, soon after nuclear science and technology industries rapidly developed after the discovery of high concentrations of fissionable material.

      Sonnia has a wide variety of terrain, making it ideal as military training area. And was used heavily to train Federated Suns troops during the early 31st century.

      The local population have a pragmatic political approach that can almost be mistaken for indifference. When asked to swear allegiance to House Liao, they did so and continued with their business. Later when asked to swear allegiance to House Davion, they were equally cooperative.
