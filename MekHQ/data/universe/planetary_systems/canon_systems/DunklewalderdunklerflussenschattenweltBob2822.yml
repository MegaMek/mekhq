    desc: Dunklewälderdunklerflüssenschattenwelt (later known as “Bob”) was never
      a wealthy or vibrant planet, however, it did manage to support a population
      of almost 350 million at its peak. However, the planet was almost completely
      destroyed during the First Succession War. Despite being written off by ComStar
      and the universe at large, small pockets of survivors lived on and despite a
      tainted atmosphere clung to life. Basic settlements were constructed and remain
      as of 3130, although technology barely exists and the world has barely clung
      to the basic engineering and manufacturing for artificial lighting and indoor
      plumbing, their technology is more on par with the 19th century than the 32nd.
