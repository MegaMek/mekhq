      Bolan is a dry, mountainous world with just enough natural resources to support the planet's populace and a modest level of industrialization. Much of the industry was crippled during the 1st Succession War when the Free Worlds League abandoned the planet and used nuclear weapons on the factories as they were departing. Industry on planet has been slowly recovering ever since. Unfortunately, many locations on planet, including the entire continent of Sabari, which was once the hub of trade and major military bases in the Star League era, are uninhabited and still scarred with radiation.

      Bolan is the provincial capital for almost the entire Lyran border with the Free Worlds League. Located on the Sabari continent in the badlands known as the Sabari Wastes, the Melissa Steiner Martial Academy of Bolan began as a facility to train the militia on Bolan and was upgraded to an academy in 3055 and was renamed in honor of Archon Melissa Steiner after her death. Graduates wear a white-silk sash.

      Bolan was primarily colonized by settlers from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
