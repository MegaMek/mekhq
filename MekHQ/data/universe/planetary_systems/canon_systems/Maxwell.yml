      Maxwell is a world of technological gaps. On one hand the mountainous but fertile terrain has resulted in the planet being primarily rural and requires most farming to be done by hand and with farm animals. However, the planet is dotted with spaceports and warehouses for shipping agriculture off world and most of the homes are equipped with high tech communications and luxuries and most residents own hovercraft of some sort, even though standard cars and trucks are nearly useless due to the terrain.

      Thanks in part to the lack of major industry and the rough, unforgiving terrain Maxwell has never been invaded. However, the planet has always been more than willing to send relief aid to war-torn neighbors.

      Maxwell is home to the original Hero Training Institute - a large for-profit institute that will train anyone that can afford their services. The Institute on Maxwell offers training for aspiring MechWarriors, Aerospace Pilots, Armored Infantry, Dropship crews, and additional Officer Training courses.
