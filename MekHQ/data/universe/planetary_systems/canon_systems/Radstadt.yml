      Overall Radstadt is a typical cool-temperate terran-planet that has sufficient resources, a lot of land devoted to agriculture with a thriving fishing industry and basic heavy industry that is capable of locally supplying most non-military grade machinery. The biggest exports from Radstadt are fish and timber, with the Radstadt Pine being prized due to its ability when treated to shimmer as if flecked with gold.

      During its time in the Draconis Combine, Radstadt was infamous for being home to one of the largest prison complexes in the entire Combine. The Lotus Flower Correctional Institute could rival most small cities in size and was located right outside of Munich, the planetary capital. The ‘pinnacle’ of the prison complex was the Black Tower, a large windowless tower of black concrete that was used to house the worst offenders in the Combine.
