    desc: Qandahar was settled for its vast natural resources. Unfortunately, the
      early settlers did not restrain the output of their factories and as a result
      the ecosystem of Qandahar eventually collapsed. The largely Arab population
      has frequently clashed with the Combine administrators, trying in a vain plea
      to clean up the world's pollution. The toxic pollution was so bad that by 3025
      50% of the native lifeforms were extinct. The only organisms that could successfully
      live outside the domed cities were the Toxic Life Forms. Developed on Terra
      in the mid 22nd century, these organisms consumed and digested toxic waste.
      In the early 31st century a small underground movement named the "Holy Struggle"
      attempted to shut down the Dow Nexus Fusion Products factories because of unsafe
      working conditions for their employees. The struggle became bloody. Though the
      ISF had several informers and agents in place to destroy the Holy Struggle they
      never stepped in because of orders from the Coordinator himself, to allow the
      movement to chastise Dow Nexus.
