    desc: 3135 - Originally known as Tau Ceti IV, the first inhabitable world seen
      by human eyes beyond the Terran solar system was so much like home, its discoverers
      on the TAS Pathfinder were quick to rename it New Earth when they arrived in
      orbit in December of 2108. Offering almost everything found on Terra herself,
      from abundant water supply to deep mineral, chemical, and metal ore deposits,
      eager colonists and corporate entities alike flocked to this new world. It comes
      as no surprise, then, that by the peak of the Star League era, New Earth was
      one of the most heavily industrialized and developed planets in the Terran Hegemony.
      Five major SLDF contractors set up their headquarters on New Earth, along with
      such successful enterprises as the New Earth Trading Company (NETC). All five
      continents—McKenna in the northwest, Lanhold to its east, the massive Neoasia
      in the south, the island continent of Kellargo, and even the north polar continent
      of Arctiqua—boasted major cities and heavy industry. Dozens of Castles Brian
      were set up on New Earth as well, and the Star League even built the famous
      Combat College of New Earth outside the capital city of Foundation Point, on
      McKenna. During the Amaris crisis, the college, most of the Castles Brian, all
      the major factories, and close to half the planet‘s largest population centers
      were destroyed by Amaris troops using every means available when it became clear
      they could not hold the planet. The world‘s gutted infrastructure and war-ravaged
      environment left the survivors shocked and demoralized, victims of widespread
      famine and disease—particularly the virulent New Earth Pox. The centuries of
      decline that followed, despite being under the banner of the wealthy Lyran state,
      did little to help pull the world out of the ruins, largely due to the continuous
      raiding and open warfare between the Lyrans and their neighbors. Only the NETC
      remained through it all, a last vestige of the once-mighty Star League and the
      only viable large corporation still active on New Earth. Headquartered in Meredith,
      on Neoasia, the NETC retained its status as a premier transport and trade facilitator
      until the Word of Blake Jihad erased Meredith from the map along with a host
      of other New Earth cities, including the capital, New Foundation. As the closest
      planet to Terra, New Earth‘s strategic value made it the focus of some of the
      Jihad‘s heaviest fighting, which leveled what industry remained and poisoned
      the land, air, and seas. Today, New Earth is populated only by the grace of
      Devlin Stone‘s Resettlement Act. Industry has only now begun to return to the
      blasted, scarred world, beginning what promises to be a long and slow recovery
      for a world that once stood so prominently beside the Cradle of Humanity. The
      capital of New Earth today is Wiedergeburt, located on Arctiqua‘s southernmost
      tip, where the effects of fallout from both of New Earth‘s horrible tragedies
      has been minimal.
