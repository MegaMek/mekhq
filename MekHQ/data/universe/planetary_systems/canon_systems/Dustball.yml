      Dustball is a small, dry, and hot planet barely suitable for human life. Despite this, the planet was settled due to reports suggesting arge tracts of mineral wealth just below the surface. Unfortunately after mining began, it was soon discovered that the reports had been incorrect. Soon after most of the miners left and the planet would have likely been abandoned entirely if not for the Malthus crime family.

      The Malthus crime family had each of the 5 domed cities set up to cater to a different vice from gambling to prostitution. There were attempts by the Lyran government to stamp out the illegal activities on Dustball, unfortunately enough high officials could be blackmailed, usually due to having enjoyed a visit to Dustball, so no measures ever held up. The establishment of Kooken’s Pleasure Pit as a legal alternative was an attempt in the early 3000s to stamp out the Malthus crime family. However, their business did not come to an end until the Clan invasion.
