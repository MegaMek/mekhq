    desc: Trinidad is a hot planet with an abundance of natural resources and water
      and sufficient arable land to supports its population. The abundance of natural
      resources have also attracted a sizable, though non-military related industrial
      base. Trinidad is home to a branch of the Hero Training Institute. However,
      this branch of the for-profit Hero Training Institute is unique. It was formed
      by a group of ex-SAFE operatives that wanted to create the first for-profit
      Special Operations training group, however the program is not formally listed
      anywhere, called only “logistics studies”, the program only accepts students
      with permission from the Dean and often requires referrals to get into the program.
      It is also the most expensive course offered at the Hero Training Institute
      but uses the best and newest equipment of any of their academies. The HTI branch
      still offers the traditional courses for any aspiring MechWarriors, Aerospace
      Pilots and armored infantry that can afford them.
