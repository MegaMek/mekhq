    desc: Loburg is an unexceptional, though relatively comfortable world that managed
      to avoid the damages of war for most of its history. The planet has a mild-temperate
      climate and a breathable atmosphere, along with enough arable land to support
      its population. The most remarkable feature of Loburg is that it is home to
      a StarCorps Industries BattleMech factory, which managed to survive the destructive
      Succession Wars and even the Word of Blake Jihad. The plant is located in Stromhead,
      the massive planetary capital on Loburg’s only continent, Temptation. Much of
      the terrain outside of the city is badlands, though there are patches of arable
      land that are used for agriculture. Most of the raw materials used in the StarCorps
      factories come from Hiburg, the second planet in the system. Unlike Loburg,
      the second planet has no atmosphere and has a higher gravity due to its massive
      size. Due to the high gravity, miners can only spend a few weeks at a time on
      Hiburg before they need to rotate back to Loburg.
