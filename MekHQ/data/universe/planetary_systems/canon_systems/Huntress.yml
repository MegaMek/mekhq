      3065: Huntress is a planet of varied climates and two continents. Abysmal is the smaller of the two continents and is dominated by deserts and badlands. Jaguar Prime is larger and is home to most of the planet's population centers, including Lootera, the planetary capital. Jaguar Prime is home to many different climates, from desert to rain forest, plains and mountains. The continent is crossed with several mountain ranges, including the northern Jaguar's Fangs, the Fangs includes Mount Szabo which overlooks the capital city. To the eastern edge of the continent is the unimaginatively named Eastern Mountains. The continent is also home to several large bodies of water, from the Black Shikari River, to Liberation Sea and the expansive Dhuan Swamp to the south. Jaguar Prime is home to almost constant grey cloud-cover and occasional fierce storms. Jaguar Prime is home to several other cities, though they are smaller than Lootera, such as Bagera, Myer, Pahn City and New Andery.

      Huntress was the capital of Clan Smoke Jaguar and their primary holding. They had complete control over the planet, with the exception of a small research facility, which they gifted to the Jade Falcons prior to the start of Operation Revival. As the home of the Smoke Jaguar Clan, Huntress is home to the Jaguar's Gene Center, a massive pyramidal structure and home to the giftakes of all of their bloodnamed warriors. The planet is also home to significant manufacturing and research facilities, as well as training and military command centers. Most of the planet's military production, bases and monuments were destroyed by Task Forces Serpent and Bull Dog, during the Inner Sphere's Jaguar Annihilation.
