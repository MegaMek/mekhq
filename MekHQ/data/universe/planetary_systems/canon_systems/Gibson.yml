      After heavy terraforming during early colonization Gibson became one of the most hospitable planets in the entire Free Worlds League. Semi-arid, but extremely comfortable for human life, Gibson manages to be completely self-sufficient. Due to the planet’s fertile farming land and comfortable atmosphere, Gibson was colonized by a wide diversity of peoples and religions.

      While the diversity of Gibson made it seem like the ideal planet for Word of Blake’s relocation during their exile from Terra. Unfortunately when the Word began forcing their beliefs on the population, they soon found public sentiment polarized against them, resulting in a bloody and costly guerrilla war between the natives of the planet and the Word of Blake. An uneasy peace was restored by Thomas Marik and the Knights of the Inner Sphere but only after the inhabitants of Gibson and their new Word of Blake neighbors received their own separate enclaves on planet.
