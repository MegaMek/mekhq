      Antwerp is a relatively comfortable planet located in the deep Periphery. The planet has abundant natural resources and sufficient arable land to feed its population, however the most notable feature of Antwerp is its manufacturing, which is not overly impressive by Inner Sphere standards, however it is one of the most diverse manufacturing centers in the deep Periphery. The Bordello Military Goods, Inc. facility is located in the rolling hills of Nederlandia, just outside of the planetary capital Jersey City and produces primitive and standard BattleMechs, combat vehicles, aerospace fighters and DropShips. The plant does not have enough production lines to produce everything at once and as a result production is ultimately lower than if it specialized in one area.
