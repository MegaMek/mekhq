    desc: David‘s water table, not its atmosphere, is actually the health hazard posed
      to humans visiting this otherwise beautiful—if somewhat arid—planet. The problem
      has been traced to microbes that form the basis of David‘s entire food chain,
      which cause severe—and sometimes fatal—allergic reactions in humans, but do
      absolutely no harm to the planet‘s native wildlife. The local population has
      long since grown immune to the effects of this taint, but visitors to David
      who plan to do anything that involves eating, drinking, or even swimming in
      any of the planet‘s few freshwater lakes, must take a series of inoculations
      in advance, or risk the consequences. Over sixty percent of David‘s surface
      is claimed by two enormous landmasses, known as Andropo and Geronomis, and a
      host of large islands that ring them. Andropo, with its more fertile soils and
      lodes of precious metals, is home to most of David‘s limited farming, which
      is sufficient to support most of the planet‘s population, as well as some light
      industry. Geronomis, more equatorial and barren in its central regions, supports
      a slightly heavier industry, and is also home to Polis, David‘s capital city
      and major spaceport.
