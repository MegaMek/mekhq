      3028 - Harrow's Sun is a vital part of the Federated Suns’ Draconis March border defense and as a result it has been the site of heavy fighting throughout the centuries. The planet’s southern continent of Briseis is primarily dominated by military bases. These bases have enough housing for up to a full six regimental combat teams. However, most of the time the bases are mostly empty and are managed by two brigades of light combat engineers and an armored regiment. The bases of Harrow’s Sun saw extensive use during the Operation Galahad exercises held in 3026 and 3027.

      Harrow’s Sun is a large planet with vast tracts of land due to the small, heavily alkali, oceans that don’t even cover half of the planet’s surface. Unfortunately, this means that while the planet has a lot of land, much of the landmass of Harrow’s Sun is landlocked and arid. Deserts and Badlands abound in the interior of the planet’s three continents with the fertile locations near the lakes, rivers and oceans. Despite the predominantly arid conditions of much of the planet, the fertile zones are actually more than sufficient to support significant agricultural concerns which can feed the planet’s population, even when the bases on Briseis are occupied.

      Due to the constant raiding and fighting over the planet, the primary industry on Harrow’s Sun is focused on construction and heavy industry. Despite this, the constant rebuilding still creates a strain on the planet’s massive fleet of ferrocrete fabricators, fortification engineers, and earthmovers. Most of the planet’s heavy industry is focused on Paris, the largest continent. Harrow’s Sun is not home to any renowned schools, but is home to many well respected trade-schools with a focus on construction and industrial work.

      The third continent of Priam is located in the southern hemisphere and is primarily focused on agricultural concerns. The vineyards of Priam are known as some of the best in the Draconis March. The residents of Paris and Priam have a negative opinion of each other, Parisians view their Priam neighbors much like embarrassing country relatives with no culture or sophistication, while the Priams view the Parisians as elitist snobs. However, deep down both continents know that they would suffer without the industry and food produced on Paris and Priam respectively.

      The planet is defended by an AFFS security force located on the moon Bane and is home to a division of marines with intrasystem boarding shuttles and converted passenger DropShips and usually supported by two wings of aerospace fighters.
