    desc: Illyria is a quiet planet in the Periphery and for centuries it was the
      capital of the small Illyrian Palatinate. The inhabitants of Illyria spent decades
      searching for rumored Star League caches, while small caches were discovered,
      they never found anything of significance. The economy of the Illyriate was
      primarily devoted to shipbuilding. In the early 3060s, Illyria was invaded and
      absorbed by the Marian Hegemony. The citizens of Illyria took their absorption
      into the Marian Hegemony relatively well and the planet remained the capital
      of the new Illyrian Province.
