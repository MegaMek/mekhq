    desc: Valuable minerals, chemical wealth, and advanced electronics, metallurgical
      and hydrocarbon fuel industries—coupled with a pleasant terrestrial climate—made
      Nashira a valuable world to both the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony.
      Rather than fighting over it, however, the Camerons and Kuritas reached a compromise
      in which the planet would be jointly administered, with the planet‘s exports
      divided evenly between their governments. This ―shared world‖ status made Nashira
      a cosmopolitan planet, with diverse Hegemony cities standing side by side with
      those of the heavily Japanese-influenced Combine. Of course, the simmering hostilities
      that tended to flare up between Combine and Hegemony citizens were worse on
      Nashira than on many other planets. The worst of these incidents occurred during
      the so-called Hidden War, when outraged Kuritans, furious over the outcome of
      an epic clash on Solaris VII between SLDF Gunslinger Daniel Allison and a so-called
      ronin named Kaneda Fujima, rioted in the capital of Logan City. The Hegemony
      city, forced to call in troops to quell the violence, requested the aid of both
      SLDF and DCMS troops on world, as was protocol during such disturbances. Unfortunately,
      in a few instances the troops found themselves drawn into the conflict, with
      SLDF units firing upon Combine troops and vice versa. More than two thousand
      lives were lost in the three bloody days of the Logan Riots, a black stain on
      the honor of both states. After the fall of the Star League, Nashira became
      a Combine holding, which made use of the local industries and valuable minerals
      to strengthen its military machine and its economic might. The Combine launched
      an extensive campaign to transform the planet into a fully Japanese culture,
      including the demolition, renovation and renaming of many Hegemony cities and
      towns. Residents who clung to non-Japanese cultures and ideologies were persecuted
      and segregated, but true atrocities were rare. For this reason, Nashira remains
      a diverse world, made more so by Devlin Stone‘s relocation programs after the
      Jihad. Logan City, on the northern continent of Katiasha, is still the planetary
      capital, with a population of almost five million. Ogawa, a city still thick
      with Combine influence, lies fifty kilometers south of Logan City and is the
      planet‘s major spaceport as well as home to a third of the planetary defense
      forces. On Nashira‘s southern continent of Copenwald are found the majority
      of the planet‘s mining and manufacturing industries, including DeValt Industries,
      a minor manufacturer of MinerMechs and ConstructionMechs, based in the city
      of New Anaheim.
