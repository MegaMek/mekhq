    desc: Dixie is a mostly typical border world between the Lyran Commonwealth and
      the Free Worlds League. However, the discovery of a Star League Castle Brian
      during the 3rd Succession War made Dixie a prime target for invasion. The few
      relics that had survived to that point were stripped from the ancient fortress
      and it returned to neglect until the late 3070s when the Lyran Alliance began
      restoring the Castle Brian. Dixie has abundant resources and arable land. The
      planet has a comfortable atmosphere and climate but lower than standard gravity.
