    desc: Brisbane is a water-rich world located along the fuzzy border between the
      Magistracy of Canopus and the Taurian Concordat. As a result the planet has
      seen more than its share of fighting between the two Periphery realms as they
      battled for Brisbane's water supply. The planet has remained a gem in the Periphery
      after the fall of the Star League thanks to its clean water, abundant ocean-life
      and function water purification plants that dot the planet's southern hemisphere.
      The planet's limited landmasses are primarily comprised of small island chains
      many of the battles for the planet have been forced into the oceans.
