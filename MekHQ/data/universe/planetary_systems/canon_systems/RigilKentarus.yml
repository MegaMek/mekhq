    desc: 3135 - Rigil Kentarus was a beautiful planet, blessed with a rare inhabitable
      moon, Riken Minor, when it was discovered in the first days of Terran exploration.
      One of the first worlds to be settled, both planet and moon were bustling centers
      of industry and commerce during the days of the Star League. Located near the
      heart of the Terran Hegemony, both the planet and moon were heavily fortified
      by the SLDF, with Castles Brian and surface-to-orbit defense stations on each.
      During the crisis that brought down the Star League, however, Amaris troops
      captured the Riken complexes in a well-coordinated blitzkrieg and used the orbital
      weapons to bombard the planet below, where remnants of the SLDF unit posted
      on the moon had gone to regroup. At such ranges, however, the aim was inaccurate,
      and missed shots from both the planetary and lunar bases delivered massive damage
      to the surface of both worlds. In the years after the League‘s fall, under the
      banner of the Lyran state, Rigil Kentarus and its moon began to recover from
      the devastation, despite numerous attacks launched by the Free Worlds League
      and the Draconis Combine. Unfortunately, this recovery was undone when the Word
      of Blake Jihad targeted Rigil Kentarus and its moon during their effort to secure
      a buffer zone around Terra. Nuclear and biochemical weapons laid waste nearly
      half the cities and installations on both worlds, costing countless lives and
      tainting the air and water of both. Today, only a few habitable cities remain
      on Rigil Kentarus, spared from the devastation only by the blind fortune of
      geography. Fewer still remain on Riken Minor. Of these, the twin capitals of
      West Romaine on the planet‘s large southern continent of Naskia, and Destina
      Station on Riken Minor‘s Lesser Plateau continent, maintain the bulk of each
      world‘s commercial and administrative infrastructure. The large spaceport city
      of Mesopita, located on Worrens, Rigil Kentarus‘ northern continent, is the
      planet‘s principal link to the moon and the stars beyond, and so is also home
      to a sizeable portion of the planetary militia.
