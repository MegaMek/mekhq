    desc: In most respects, Skat is an unremarkable world with four large continents
      covering almost half the planetary surface, three tiny asteroid moons in close
      orbit, and slightly more ozone in the atmosphere than healthy for breathing
      without either respirators or specialized antioxidant medication. The planet‘s
      first settlers actually hailed from two distinct colonial groups—one of Japanese
      and Korean descent, and the other from a combined German-Austrian venture. The
      groups staked out two separate continents for settlement, with the Japanese
      and Koreans claiming the southern landmass of Quayling, and the German-Austrian
      group claiming Freiheim. The two colonial groups expanded to the other two continents
      of Uchida and Unzervalt over the next several decades, when a dispute over fishing
      territory and an island chain finally erupted into open conflict during the
      Age of War. The conflict was settled thanks to intervention by the Terran Hegemony,
      and Skat became part of that alliance until the fall of the Star League. Today,
      after falling under the dominion of Houses Davion and Kurita in turn during
      the Succession Wars, Skat‘s dominantly Germanic and Asian population continues
      to maintain a dual-cultural world. After rising and falling from prominence
      as the House Lords changed, the cities of Aneheim, along Freiheim‘s Kirschner
      River, and Inyong City, on Quayling‘s southern coast, once again form the twin
      capitals of the planet. Skat‘s largest spaceport, Jinyiang, is located on Uchida,
      while the city of Londerhalt is arguably the planet‘s largest industrial center.
