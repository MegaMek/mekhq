      3135 - A cold world orbiting a dim red star, Zebeneschamali was initially settled by colonists from Terra‘s Middle Eastern region, who wanted nothing more than to establish a life far away from the corrupting influence of their homeworld. Though the climate of their new home was not the same as the warm, arid region from which they came, and though the planet lacked significant raw material resources beyond basic industrial metals and common chemicals, the new settlers took to their new home and established several small towns along the banks of the rivers on Kirikahmed, the planet‘s primary continent. Within a few decades, the colonial population swelled and new settlements rose across the plains and rugged landscape of Kirikahmed‘s northern reaches, and bolder adventurers turned eager eyes to the untapped expanse of the North and South Arragon continents. However, upon making survey flights over the western coast of North Arragon, the native Zebeneschamalis were shocked to discover the presence of other human settlements, apparently recently established. Originating from a failed expedition to Unukalhai, these new colonists had come to this promising world after failing to establish their own, believing Zebeneschamali to be uninhabited when they landed. The discovery and immediate reaction led to a string of violent clashes as each colonial group declared the other an invading force, but this fighting eventually died down when leaders on both sides reached an agreement on their mutual expansion.

      Not long afterward, Zebeneschamali became a part of the Federation of Skye, and eventually the Lyran Commonwealth, and remained under the Lyran banner throughout the age of the Star League and the Succession Wars that followed. Never regarded as a significant military target, this world was overlooked even by the Blakists during their Jihad, though rumors persist to this day that some of the zealots actually ran to the hinterlands of the mostly unpopulated continent of South Arragon after the fall of Terra.

      Today, a trace of Zebeneschamali‘s founding decades can still be seen in the slightly different cultural and religious mores of the North Arragon and Kirikahmed populations, as well as in the presence of two capital cities—one for each continent. The Kirikahmed capital and primary spaceport, which is also regarded as the primary planetary administrative center, is Ur-Kabal, while the North Arragon capital city, Jakrit, touts itself as the planet‘s second largest population center and spaceport city.
