    desc: "3135 - Azha is a small but strategically important world due to its location.
      The Bureaucratic and Logistical Offices of the Capellan military were located
      on Azha in support of the Tikonov and Sarna Commonalities.\n\nAzha‘s dry atmosphere
      borders on being a desert world. However, it has enough arable landmass to support
      its population. Azha produces raw materials for microchips.\n\nAzha has three
      continents, Castellan is the largest of the three and distinctively lacks mountains.
      The capital, Casella, is located on the southwestern coast. The flatlands and
      rolling hills surrounding Casella had some of the largest supply depots in the
      Confederation. The continent of Brasilia is located in the southern hemisphere,
      and its climate is cool and moist enough to support food production. Ortega
      is the smallest of the three continents and the most underdeveloped. During
      the 2351–2352 Tikonov-Sarna War, Ortega was the site of such savagery that no
      one ever ventured back to the continent and giving rise to rumours of ghosts
      and hauntings.\n\nDuring the Jihad, the World of Blake forces arrived via a
      pirate point that allowed them to slip into orbit and land on Ortega. After
      ensuring that the depots at Casella were protected, the local Capellan militia
      deployed to Ortega to engage the invaders, where they mysteriously disappeared
      and were never heard from again. The planet surrendered shortly thereafter. "
