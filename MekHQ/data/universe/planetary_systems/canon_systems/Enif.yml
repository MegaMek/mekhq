      Enif was first settled in 2600 and the planet’s primary importance has been as a staging world for DCMS assaults into the Periphery. The planet’s only export for centuries were large shipments of grain to neighboring planets. In 2982, Luthien Armor Works built a smelter and armor sheeting facility.

      It wasn’t until after the Clan invasion that a mining expedition to the system’s distant astroid belt discovered large deposits of germanium, a vital component to building K-F drive cores. Within ten years, the planet’s population tripled and new factories and facilities from New Samarkand Metals, Stellar Trek, and LAW popped up.

      Planetary restrictions restricted these new developments to the Cotswold continent, while native Enivians were allowed to settle the isolated smaller continents of Scotswold and Potswold to maintain the ‘sleepy backwater’ identity the planet has cultivated over the centuries. Native Enivians fear that  ‘the Newcomers’ are a challenge to their slower pace of life, while the Newcomers often mock the natives for their simplistic lifestyles.

      Enif’s educational system is poor, even by lower-class standards in the Combine, and as a result, Enif citizens can rarely make it into military academies and citizens that make it into the DCMS rarely make it past the lowest ranks.

      The continent of Cotswold is home to large, rolling plains that great herds of wild Enivian mustangs roam.
