      The first colony on Taurus was founded January 23, 2253 and the planet was the first colonized and capital of what would become the Taurian Concordat. Taurus is rich in minerals and has alwasy been a vital source of food, raw materials and manufacturing for the entire Concordat. It is the cultural, political, and industrial center of the Concordat.

      For most of its history, the capital of Taurus was the city of Samantha, which was the jewel of the Concordat and home to the University of Taurus, one of the most respected schools and research facilities in all of the Inner Sphere, unfortunately the city was utterly destroyed in 3074 after a series of asteroid strikes. The capital was relocated to the city of New Chappelle and reconstruction of 'New Samantha' was promised and planned but no work had begun as of 3080.

      Taurus is home to a number of military industries and academies. Magna Metals is located in the city of Palermo on the Sicily continent and produces energy weapons and fusion weapons for BattleMechs, Aerospace fighters, DropShips and Small Craft. The headquarters for Taurus Territorial Industries is located in the old planetary capital of Samantha on the continent of Calderon and managed to survive the city's destruction, and still produces BattleMechs and combat vehicles, though at significantly reduced production levels. Ã‰cole Militaire is a premier training academy in the Concordat, unfortunately the campus was destroyed with the rest of Samantha, however the university is rebuilding in the Tulsa Flats on the Sicily continent and continues to train MechWarriors and infantry.
