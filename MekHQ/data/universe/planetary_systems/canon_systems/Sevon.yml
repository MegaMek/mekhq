      Sevon is a quiet agricultural planet with a small population and only modest industry and technology, despite abundant natural resources and arable land. Sevon is home to Alliance Industries Diversified which produced a wide variety of items from farm equipment, to pharmaceuticals, to mining and refining natural resources such as oil and ore and even the production of military grade armor.

      Sevon was famously the location of the Star League’s first defeat during Operation UNION HOLD, thanks to the Pitcairn Legion, whose members were all from the Federated Suns. The Legion managed to inflict significant damage to the SLDF’s 6th Royal Division and cause a tense standoff until the arrival of several Combine forces arrived and forced the Legion off of Sevon. However, the Outworlds Alliance continued to fight, with the population of Sevon running a guerrilla war on the planet and the Alliance sending fighter groups through to harass the Star League Defense Forces present in the system until the war between the Star League and the Outworlds Alliance officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Cerberus.
