      3135 - Carsphairn is blessed with striking and varied landscapes but cursed with violent weather systems, largely the result of the pull of three large moons. The weather varies from continuous, weeks-long spring and autumn downpours to frequent tornadoes in the summer, and crippling blizzards and ice storms in the winter. To withstand the effects of the storms, the locals built their structures low, and erected protective domes over many of their farms. Carsphairn's fertile soil sustain hybrid Terran crops and local animals. While mineral wealth has allowed for a rudimentary level of industrialization and exports. Narcisse, the planetary capital, is located on the primary continent of Gillinia. Narcisse has a large seaport as well as a spaceport, linking travelers to the other four main landmasses of Basallia, North Teslia, South Teslia, and Yddrig.

      Located securely inside the Federation of Skye, Carsphairn was largely overlooked during the Succession Wars. The local government was easily swayed to join the Free Skye movement as the population saw the Lyran government as even more intrusive than Skye worlds that bordered hostile neighbors.

      During the Jihad, Carsphairn was raided several times by Word of Blake forces as it was an easy stop for foodstuffs to sustain their longer campaigns. This strategy forced the stationing of a permanent garrison of a mix of Lyran, Combine, and Clan Wolf warriors in the latter half of the war. Since becoming a member-world of the Republic of the Sphere, many of these garrison troops became part of Prefecture VIII militia remain on Carsphairn.
