      Rasalhague was originally settled prior to the formation of the Terran Hegemony by settlers primarily hailing from Sweden and northern European countries, fleeing the poor conditions on Earth and to seek independence. What they discovered in Rasalhague was a large terran-like planet distantly orbiting its star, with a cool-temperate climate that reminded them of home. Despite hardships, including a deadly local virus, Rasalhague grew quickly and the abundant natural resources attracted corporations and heavy industry, including ‘Mech production. The planet is also home to exotic plants and animals that are especially plentiful in the equatorial tropics.

      Unfortunately, independence did not last long for the people of Rasalhague when the Principality of Rasalhague fell to the Draconis Combine. Rasalhague’s history under the Combine is sorted, often depending on who the Coordinator was. In 3034, Rasalhague was again freed, creating the Free Rasalhague Republic with the planet Rasalhague as the new state’s capital. Unfortunately, independence was once again short lived and in 3052 Rasalhague fell to Clan Wolf and most of the FRR was absorbed by Clan Wolf and Clan Ghost Bear.
