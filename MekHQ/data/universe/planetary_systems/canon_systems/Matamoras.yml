      Matamoras is historically a major source of resources for the Draconis Combine. The planet extracts, refines, and exports millions of tons of rare metals and materials that are critical to military production that feeds the DCMS.

      The planet was home to three major manufacturing centers that produced weapons and conventional vehicles for the Combine, however, by 2942 all three had been destroyed. The last of which was destroyed during the Third Succession War by a Lyran deep raid.

      Matamoras is battered by constant, and brutal, winds. Wind speeds can exceed four hundred kilometers per hour and Matamoras is the windiest planet in the entire Combine. The relentless winds of Matamoras have resulted in unique and impressive rock formations scattered across the desert terrain that dominates most of the planet. The unique terrain’s beauty appears in art and literature throughout the Combine and an inspiration for Azami artisans.

      Matamoras was founded in the 2600s solely for its natural resources. After hundreds of years, the planet only remains relevant because of its numerous mines and heavy industry. Despite its natural beauty, it attracts few visitors and even fewer settlers beyond miners and industrial workers and the minimal support to maintain employee living for both.

      The southern continent, Siberia, maintained a notorious prison complex until the mid-2700s. The administration abandoned the facility with the prisoners locked into their cells. Due to the harsh-climate of the world, the prisoners did not escape, however, when a shuttle was forced to perform an emergency landing in the area in 2913, they discovered a small but thriving community descended from the over three thousand prisoners that had been left behind.

      New Samarkand Metals is the main employer on Matamoras and owns more than fifty mines and processing sites scattered across the planet.

      The capital of Matamoras is Vladivostok. Due to the wind, more than 60% of the capital is built deep into natural caverns, carved by an ancient underground sea, of the twin peaked mountain, The Brothers. The Matamoras spaceport is located just outside of the city and away from the mountain. The city center is dominated by a massive formation of red stalagmites that resemble several ancient Terran Russian leaders, and are called the Bloody Tsars by the locals.

      Due to the winds and high gravity, most employees on Matamoras work on five or ten-year rotations. The DCMS regularly rotates units through annually, so that soldiers can receive high-gravity and high-wind combat training.

      In the 31st century, a fad known as ‘wind skirmishing’ emerged involving lightweight bodysuits with glider webbing and paint pellet guns. Teams glide along the strong winds and try to score more hits on their opponents.
