      McEvedy’s Folly was one of many planets skipped over in initial colonization because it would have required terraforming to comfortably inhabit and the planet was deemed of scientific interest in its natural state. The planet was in the grips of an ice age and scientists were curious to study the effects if the ice age was reversed. Unfortunately for the planet, it was not until the mid 2700s that experimental terraforming efforts began under Doctor Alpheus McEvedy. While initial work went well, the doctor slowly became obsessed with bringing terrestrial life that had gone extinct on Earth and other planets back to life and superiors back in the Hegemony and assistants on planet began to suspect he was losing his grip on reality.

      The planet was eventually raided by unknown forces, which took most of the terraforming station’s supplies and the Hegemony used it as an excuse to recall the scientist and his crew. However, McEvedy refused orders to leave, stating his projects were not done. He continued to work on them even after his staff eventually rebelled and abandoned them. With the turmoil of Amaris’ rise to power and the resulting Civil War, the scientific project was lost and forgotten for centuries.

      When the planet was rediscovered in the 31st century, the world was full of strange hybrid creatures from Dr. McEvedy’s experimentations. The last human on the planet, Dr. McEvedy, had further lost his mind and eventually killed himself in 2783.
