    desc: 3135 - Like most worlds close to Terra in the dark days leading to the Star
      League‘s fall, the once-thriving planet of Epsilon Indi suffered badly at the
      hands of Amaris forces during the crisis. Captured early in the coup through
      a liberal use of neutron weapons and lightning strikes against orbital defense
      sites, the population was decimated and the world became a gauntlet for SLDF
      forces to pass through. An entire SLDF fleet and its attached ground forces
      were obliterated while attempting to liberate the planet early in Kerensky‘s
      campaign, demonstrating the horrific costs of any frontal assault. The eventual
      assault that broke the hold of Amaris‘ troops, however, led the Usurper‘s men
      to resort to scorched-earth tactics, razing cities and factories with what remained
      in their nuclear arsenal. Today, even centuries later, Epsilon Indi is a wasteland
      of deserts, empty seabeds, and bombed-out cities, whose population now inhabits
      only the polar regions, which were spared most of the fallout. The rich mineral
      deposits across the planet‘s four main landmasses are now accessible to mining
      operations based in the polar continents of Boreria in the north, and Kantiles
      in the south. Kirst, Epsilon Indi‘s largest mining settlement, is located on
      the northern shore of Kantiles, a scant 400 kilometers from the southern edge
      of the uninhabitable wastes of the Surterra continent. The north-equatorial
      landmass of Ithicasia, just east of Surterra, suffered just as badly from the
      damage of the Amaris occupation and liberation, but is nonetheless home to the
      domed mining colony of Vogelton. During the Jihad, Word of Blake forces staged
      many of their operations from Boreria, particularly from the capital city of
      New Rhodes, but were driven off by a combination of local resistance and elements
      of the famous Northwind Highlanders mercenary unit. Today, Epsilon Indi is a
      world continuing to struggle for its recovery from the scars of war.
