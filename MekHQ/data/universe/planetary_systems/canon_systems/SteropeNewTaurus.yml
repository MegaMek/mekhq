    desc: Sterope was not colonized until the 26th century during a concerted effort
      by the Taurian Concordat to settle more worlds. Sterope is a comfortable planet
      with abundant natural resources, sufficient arable land to feed its population
      and well established industry. Sterope is home to several military manufacturers,
      including Sterope Defense Industries in the planetary capital of Tegea on the
      Siren continent, which produces many of the BattleMech scale weapons for the
      Concordat, and a satellite factory for Taurus Territorial Industries which is
      located in Taurus City and also on the continent of Siren. The TTI plant produces
      aerospace fighters, combat vehicles, battle armor, dropships and defensive equipment
      including static gun emplacements and mines. Sterope is also home to the Sterope
      Taurian Academy, which trains armored and unarmored infantry in the mountain
      town of Heracles on the Siren continent.
