      During the War of 3039 Matar was targeted for its strategic position. From Matar the attackers could land on either Proserpina or Irurzun. The 1st Kestrel Grenadiers and 1st Kathil Uhlans landed on the world in April, but a series of poor drops left the AFFS forces scattered across the Tri-City Region. After 28 hours of hard fighting, the AFFS forces had claimed all their objectives, but a regiment of militia armor and a population loyal to the Draconis Combine resisted the invasion. To make matters worse, Matar's citizens hunted the world's plentiful wildlife as a pastime so they were well armed.

      In late September 3039 the 11th Ghost and 12th Ghost regiments arrived. Close combat in the Tri-City region resulted in a great deal of collateral damage, resulting in the population taking up arms against the AFFS forces. After two more months of hard fighting, the Tri-City region was effectively destroyed and the DCMS troops had successfully driven the AFFS off Matar.
