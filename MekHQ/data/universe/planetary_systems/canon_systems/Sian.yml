      The planet is known for lush jungles and tropical environments. Development is controlled and limited so that much of the terrain outside of cities is virgin wilderness. The planetary capital Zi-Jin Cheng (“Forbidden City”) is also the capital of the Capellan Confederation and home to the Celestial Palace, home to House Liao.

      Sian has been the capital of the Capellan Confederation since 2368 when Capella was evacuated and bombarded by the Confederation Navy after the former capital was occupied by Davion peace-keepers. At the time Sian was the home of the Chancellor's summer palace and home to House Liao's political apparatus, the infamous Maskirovka (or Secret Service) and House Imarra (the original Warrior House regiment). Sian is likely the best-defended world in the Confederation, garrisoned by the Capellan Hussars with supporting AeroSpace fighter contingents commanded by the best pilots in the Confederation and by the Warrior Houses battalions that rotate to Sian periodically for special training.

      Sian has heavy industry and several centers for higher learning and military training. Ceres Metals is located in the woodlanded wetlands of the Imarra continent and produces BattleMechs. Hellspont Industries in the city ofSylbari on the Imarra continent produces various combat vehicles and eventually battlearmor. Additionally, Hellespont has a 'Mech factory located in the same city, with satellite facilities in space at the L2 point. Saroyan Special Production produces aerospace and conventional fighters in the badlands of Imarra. Sian Center for Martial Disciplines is located on the Wuhan continent and has a vast campus and trains recruit MechWarrior, Aerospace pilots, DropShip and Jumpship crews, vehicle crews, as well as armored and unarmored infantry. Sian University on Liaoning is one of the finest centers of learning in the whole Confederation. Additionally, Sian is home to one of the Confederation's many Duchy RTC facilities, which trains vehicle crews and infantry.

      Manufacturing centers:
      Ceres Metals
      Hellspont Industries
      Hellspont 'Mech Works
