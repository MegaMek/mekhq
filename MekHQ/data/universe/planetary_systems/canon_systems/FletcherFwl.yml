      All four continents on Fletcher are dominated by mountain ranges and the planet was colonized in order to mine these raw materials and a large industrial base was established to make use of them. Additionally during the peace of the Star League, Fletcher became widely known as a tourist attraction for its ‘winter-sports’ venues. Unfortunately the mountainous terrain also leaves Fletcher with very little arable land requiring the planet to rely heavily on imported foodstuffs.

      Fletcher survived the worst ravages of the Succession Wars thanks largely to the construction of most factories directly into the sides of the mountains that cover the planet. This made them extremely difficult targets to destroy and as a result they made it through the centuries of warfare relatively intact. In the mid 31st Century dry docks were established in orbit for the creation, maintenance and repair of spacecraft. The Word of Blake Jihad also passed Fletcher by, however reports of Fletcher in the Terran Corridor being captured and eventually liberated by the Coalition forces causes confusion and hurt business with "Oriente's Fletcher".
