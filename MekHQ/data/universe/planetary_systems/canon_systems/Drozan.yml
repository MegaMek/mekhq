    desc: Drozan is a warm, temperate planet well suited to a nearly infinite variety
      of agricultural production. Drozan provides five percent of the Confederation's
      annual food requirements through large, continuously operating, automated cultivation
      and processing plants. A well-developed aquafarming industry complements the
      terrestrial technology. A growing food synthesis industry is supported by research
      facilities in Drozan's northern hemisphere. At least one Warrior House battalion
      is stationed on the planet at all times and rotated on a monthly basis to give
      the impression of larger troop strength. A variety of motorised and jump-trained
      militia are also based on Drozan, with mechanized equipment reserves in place
      at all times. Drozan is home to a Duchy RTC which focuses on training vehicle
      crews and unarmored infantry.
