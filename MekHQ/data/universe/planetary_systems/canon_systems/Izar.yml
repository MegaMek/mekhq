      Izar‘s parent star is actually part of a binary system that consists of a cool, orange K0 sun orbiting a blue-white B5 subgiant. Because of the substantial distance between the two stars, planets were miraculously able to form close to both stars, but only the closest world of the smaller star had developed a breathable atmosphere and enough surface water to support life when it was discovered early in man‘s journey into space. However, Izar‘s orbit, roughly half again as far from its parent star as Terra is from Sol, rendered it a cool world. In fact, with clouds and storms common—even over the interior of the larger landmasses of Celta, Eddin, Morope and Trantara—nights on Izar were particularly cold. Though this did not faze the native evergreen woods that covered most of the hilly mainlands, colonists quickly learned that the only way to make use of the world‘s fertile soil for their own crops was to encapsulate their farms beneath environmentally sealed domes.

      Izar also boasted substantial natural resources, including rare earths and industrial-grade metals capable of supporting a robust manufacturing industry, and the early settlers quickly attained a level of self-sufficiency with minimal off-world support. Thus it came as little surprise on Terra when this world declared its independence during the Outer Reaches Rebellion, or that the Terran Alliance sent a doomed expedition to reclaim it in 2236. The spirited defense by natives determined to retain their independence, despite their own fighters‘ primitive arms in the face of the Alliance‘s heavier weapons, eventually forced the Terrans to withdraw, but the Izarians enjoyed their freedom for only a short time before the Terran Hegemony rose in the Alliance‘s place. During the Amaris crisis, the Usurper‘s troops razed a number of cities, including the capital of Promise Point (since rebuilt) on the northern Eddin continent, while rooting out native and SLDF defenders. However, simmering resistance remained until General Kerensky finally liberated the world. After the planet became a part of the Lyran Commonwealth‘s Federation of Skye, following the fall of the League, the Izarians‘ historic love for independence sympathized with the Free Skye movement, and many of that separatist organization‘s finest volunteers hailed from their world. Though raided several times during the Succession Wars, Izar would never again be conquered by another state until its peaceful ceding to The Republic of the Sphere in the wake of the Word of Blake‘s Jihad.

      Apart from the planetary capital of Promise Point, Izar boasts a second major spaceport in the city of Rhyss on the southern Trantara continent.
