    desc: Butler is a comfortable, warm-temperate planet that for most of its history
      was part of the Lyran Commonwealth. Butler avoided the worst of the Succession
      Wars primarily due to its lack of importance. Butler contains modest raw materials
      and agricultural concerns that are enough to make the planet self sufficient
      and these raw materials feed the on planet industry, which is well established
      despite remaining fairly basic with limited output. After the planet was captured
      by Clan Jade Falcon during Operation Revival, the Falcons spent resources upgrading
      the factories on planet to support the Butler Shipyards, which they built in
      3060.
