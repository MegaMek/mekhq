    desc: Established early on as a major industrial planet, Errai‘s population swelled
      in the days of the Star League, with electronics, fusion reactors, and heavy
      industrial equipment—including a wide range of industrial ‘Mechs— all being
      manufactured by local companies. In the wake of the Star League‘s fall, the
      Federated Suns occupied Errai, and for a while, under Davion rule, the planet
      experienced a surge in commercialism, including the establishment of a number
      of casinos and nightclubs that quickly fell under the sway of the local mobs.
      For a time, widespread crime and corruption—attributed to the mobs—characterized
      Errai‘s business and politics. In the 3060s, aid from ComStar allowed Maltex
      Corporation to rebuild its factories on planet and began construction of both
      Thug and Wyvern ‘Mechs as well as industrial ‘Mechs. Errai also supports the
      planetside headquarters of Null-Gee Metals, a relatively small corporation that
      operates numerous mining colonies in the Errai system asteroid belt. Both Null-Gee
      Metals and Maltex Corporation are located on Errai‘s primary continent of Carrigan.
      The planetary capital of Errai Prime is located on the secondary continent of
      Hallens, which also features two of Errai‘s main spaceports.
