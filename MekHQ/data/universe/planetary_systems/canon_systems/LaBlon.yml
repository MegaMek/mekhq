      La Blon is a tropical world almost completely covered by water. Its three main landmasses, Elise (in the northern hemisphere), Ballay, and Renaria (in the southern), are more like large islands than continents, and each is surrounded by a host of smaller island clusters. This, combined with the planet‘s warmth and typically moderate weather—except during the “wet seasons,” when tropical storms and hurricanes become more of the norm—has made La Blon a favorite vacation spot for tourists. Despite this allure, it was the abundant natural resources of the planet and its inhabitable moon, Ivanov, which drew colonists here centuries ago. A wealth of common metals and modestly fertile soils have given La Blon a ubsistence-level economy in mining, light manufacturing, and even agriculture, more than enough to supplement its seasonal tourism trade. These features made La Blon a favorite corporate retreat during the height of the Star League and again under Lyran rule during the height of the Federated Commonwealth alliance. La Blon became known as the place where one could go to get away from it all and still be connected to the real world.
      Though the planet‘s exports offered very little of military value, raids were not uncommon during the Succession Wars after the Star League fell. Fortunately, these raids did little to mar the natural beauty or seriously disrupt the local economy and infrastructure of this planet. Even the Word of Blake Jihad overlooked La Blon as anything more than a jump -off point to attack other worlds. While this has limited any actual fighting that happened within the system over the centuries, the people of La Blon eventually earned a reputation for naïveté, assuming that war either could not touch them, or that its effects would only be a slight disruption, like mid-flight turbulence.

      La Blon‘s capital, Amadeus, is located at the foot of the Carbondale Mountains on Elise. The city is also home to the planet‘s largest spaceport and to La Blon Interstellar Entertainment (LBIE). Founded shortly after the formation of The Republic, LBIE has since branched out from film and tri-vid production, and now also lays a significant claim to the planet‘s hotel and travel brokerage industries. The coastal city of Lisellei, on the Renaria continent, boasts the planet‘s largest seaport, and is home to the Diamond Mine, easily La Blon‘s largest casino resort.
