        <description>Filtvelt Military Academy, initially serving the Federated Suns' Outback region and later the Filtvelt Coalition, is built during the late Third Succession War near Undredal's capital. Similar to Kilbourne Academy, FMA offers educational opportunities to civilians in a region scarce in options. Despite lacking advanced resources like simulators, FMA excels by providing intensive practical training, producing graduates well-prepared for real combat situations, though they are often underestimated by larger military entities.</description>
