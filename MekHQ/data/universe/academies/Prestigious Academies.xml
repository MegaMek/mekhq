        <description>The Marshalry Academy trains Marshals in the Fronc Reaches. Since 3075, instruction has taken place in Freedom's Ring, with equal emphasis on law enforcement and combat training. Due to a lack of simulators, cadets learn using the BattleMechs of the instructing Marshals. This hands-on approach ensures that graduates are well-versed in both maintaining order and engaging in combat within the Reaches.</description>
