# Young Wolves

In June of 3057, tension between the Wolf and Jade Falcon clans led to the outbreak of the Refusal War. Khan Elias Crichell of Clan Jade Falcon fought the war to destroy his most powerful rival to power. IlKhan Ulric Kerensky fought the war to weaken the fighting capability of the Crusader movement and thus delay the resumption of the drive to Terra. Far more than just a simple Trial of Refusal, the Refusal War at some point involved virtually the entire Touman of both clans and would lead directly or indirectly to the death of four Khans and the death, rebirth and sundering of one clan. The war's implications would ripple out far from the original belligerents to effect the balance of power in the Inner Sphere for a generation.

This is the story of a Trinary of young Wolf warriors eager to write their own line in the Remembrance through glory and sacrifice. The Refusal War will test their resolve, skill, and, most importantly, their loyalty.

        Greetings, @commander. Welcome to Colmar, first of the tombs in which we will bury the Jade Falcons. You have been assigned to my task force for this offensive. Before we get started, let me ask you a simple question. Do you have a problem serving under a Khan older than your generparents' geneparents and tainted by the Inner Sphere?

      <title>A Disgrace?</title>
      <question>
        Did you hear that stravag woman's use of contractions? She is a disgrace to the clan. How dare she call herself a Wolf! She should have died honorably in a solahma unit years ago. Instead she lives on as a testament to the corruption of the Inner Sphere. If she had not placed a moratorium on trials until after this conflict, I would challenge her to a trial of grievance immediately.

      <question>
        My task force departs for Wotan in one hour. There we will teach the Falcons a final lesson, although I do not expect to survive it. The remains of your task force is to join mine for this final battle.

        However, perhaps that is not the right path for you and your warriors. As you know, Khan Ward has taken many of our warriors with a Warden view into the Inner Sphere. They will live there in exile, helping to prepare the Spheroids for the end of the Tukayyid Truce.

        To live in exile is no easy thing and I would not force you to make such a decision. Yet, I cannot help but feel that you and your young pups have more to give to the cause. So I will give you the choice. Will you come to Wotan with me or will you join Khan Ward in exile?

        *She looks you in the eye.*

        I have never been the same after that. That family does not deserve what our "holy mission" has given them. When I think of things that are worth dying for in battle, I think not of glory or honor, but that family.

      <narrative>
        As you know, Ulric organized your ad-hoc trinary mostly from young and idealistic Wolf warriors. Your job is to whip them into a fighting force that can carry on the legacy of Clan Wolf, however this conflict ends. At the moment, I am not assigning you to a cluster but rather keeping you in my back pocket as a reserve force to be used as needed.

        I had hoped to keep you in that pocket a little longer, but the dezgra Falcons on Colmar have called in their reserve bid and are pushing through our lines in the Marakaa Valley. I need you to go plug some holes, immediately. Show these young pups what it means to be a warrior of Clan Wolf!

      <narrative>
        Hello, @commander. I am Star Commander Louisa and I will be commanding your transport Dropship, *Moonhowler*, for this offensive. We are immediately over the LZ and will be coming down hard. Please brace yourself.

        *G-forces glue to your seat as you hear the roar of the engines from below. After minutes of sustained pressure, it eases suddenly with an abrupt jolt.*

        And that is touchdown. Prepare bays for egress.

        *You hear the distant sound of hydraulic motors.*

        @commanderRank, we have landed and are ready to dismount your forces. All the information you need is available in the on-board briefing room. Good hunting, @commanderRank!

        It looks like your pups cut some teeth today, @commanderRank. As you saw, the Falcons are not honoring us with zellbrigen, so I would recommend that you return the favor for the foreseeable future.

        I am happy to report that the Falcon presence on Colmar have been eliminated. I will be taking my Wolf Spiders to officially liberate the capital. You should return to your dropship and get busy with repairs. We will travel with Khan Phelan Ward's forces to Sudeten for another round of hunting green birds.

        Welcome back, @commanderRank. Once you have your mechs secured in their bays, I am ready to boost for orbit. From there, we are headed to Sudeten along with the rest of the joint task force. Hopefully that should give you enough time to deal with any battle damage and injuries.

      <narrative>
        Hello, @commander. I am the chief tech on board here. I see you have been out busting up my machines. Do not worry, my team can fix almost anything, so we will get right on it. You can head over to the repair bay to check on our progress.

        We have quite a few parts and equipment in storage aboard the ship, but keep in mind that once those supplies are used up, we do not have access to anything more, given wartime shortages. So if you want to make sure you stay in supply, you will want to be sure to salvage whatever isorla you can from your battles. You can always check on our supplies by heading over to the warehouse.

        We also have some second-line mechs mothballed in the cargo bay. These mechs can be used to replace units that have been completely destroyed. Just keep in mind it will take some time to pull those units out of mothball so be sure to give me some advance warning.

      <title>Welcome to Baker 3</title>
      <narrative>
        Welcome to Baker 3, @commanderRank! At this point, you have already probably heard the rumors about Khan Ward's task force. After smashing the Falcons on Sudeten, his entire task force was diverted at my command to the Inner Sphere where they will help prepare the Spheroids for a resumption of hostilities with our brethren. He brought with him the entire genetic repository of our Clan.

        Like every other damn warrior in this Touman, you may have your own opinions about this decision. Frankly, I don't give a damn right now. From an operational point, all it means is that we will not have Khan Ward's forces available to us and so I will need to lean more heavily on my existing forces, including yours. In other words, I hope you got all the dents out of your mechs because I am going to need them shortly.

      <narrative>
        We will be tackling Baker 3 with a two-pronged assault. Most of our forces will distract the Falcons with a straightforward assault. The remaining forces will use the heat of the hot-spring fed waters of the Baker River to march upriver and directly into the Falcon's rear area. I would like you to contribute a Star to each operation. You are welcome to choose which warriors to assign, but we will drop into the LZ in two hours, so get them ready now.

        Excellent work, @commander. Our strike into the rear of the Falcon line has thrown them into disarray. The loss of supplies and communications from your successful mission has been particularly notable. It is just mop up work at this point, so I am sending you back to your dropship for repair and resupply.

        I expected better from you, @commander. Happily, despite your failure to achieve the objectives I gave you, our little adventure has been a rousing success. The surprise attack has thrown the Falcons into disarray, and at this point it is mop up work. Since clearly your units must be in dire need of repair to leave the field so hastily, I am sending you back to your dropship for repair and resupply. Think on your failure and do better next time.

      <narrative>
        Well, things have gone pear-shaped down on Devin. It seems the Falcons knew a big storm was coming on and used that to their advantage on the O'Tsung Plain. Our forces are making a fighting withdrawal to their dropships. I need you to make a combat drop near the front lines and hold off the Falcons long enough to evacuate as many of our forces as we can. We are not going to win this one @commander, but we may be able to turn a killing blow into a flesh wound if your young pups have the mettle to see it through.

        *Shortly after, you are buffeted about in your combat seat from the heavy winds hitting the descending dropship.* 
        
        Bring us down tight and steady, pilot! You flip this egg, and you pay for it!
        
        *You can hear the metal struts supporting the hull groan with the pressure. Then suddenly there is a jerk and all is momentarily silent. The bay doors begin to open with a hydraulic whine and you hear the howl of heavy winds from outside as sand is blown across the metal floor of the hangar bay.*
        
        And that is touchdown! You are clear for egress, @commanderRank. Good hunting!

        *Ulric regards you for a moment before nodding his assent.*

        You are a noble warrior. I might have wished to have you carry on the Warden legacy, but I will not deny you your chance of honor and glory. We lift off for Wotan in an hour. You best prepare your warriors for what is to come.

        I have no doubt that honor and glory await you in the future, @commander. I rest easier knowing the future is in good hands.

        You must travel to Morges where Khan Ward is preparing his forces for the inevitable Jade Falcon attack. Go with honor, @commanderRank.

        *Ulric squeezes your shoulder and then walks away.*

        *As you turn to watch Ulric go, you see that all the warriors of your trinary are gathered around you in a semi-circle.*

        Our clan is being corrupted from within by these surat Wardens and yet you would defend her? It is good at least to know where your loyalties lie. Perhaps, when this is all over, a trial of annhiliation will wipe the taint from our ranks.

        *Tayyiba nods her head vigorously.*

        Without Natasha Kerensky and Phelan Ward, I believe tht we would have failed on Tukkayid like so many other clans. They showed us the importance of being flexible and adaptable. Being stuck in one's ways is a recipe for defeat, quiaff? I learned that on Tukkayid, as well, in a more personal way.

      <title>Tayyiba's Concern</title>
      <narrative>
        My unit, the third Battle Cluster was tasked with garrison duty when our forces pulled back to re-supply before the assault on Brzo. We did not expect the Comguards to hit us, but that is exactly what they did. Multiple divisions ambushed us. We were outnumbered three to one. We fought like hell and dished out more than we took, but we were decimated. I blacked out after my second ammo bin popped off.

        When I came to, I was lying in the bedroom of a small farmhouse not far from the fighting. Apparently, I had dragged myself several miles from the battlefield before collapsing in an agricultural drainage ditch, although I remember none of it. A local farming family found me and took me in.

      <narrative>
        They did not care that I was the enemy. I was a just a person in need of help. They nursed me back to health. They had two children. Their names were Kate and Tynan. They would sit at the foot of my bed and ask me questions about life in the Clans for hours. They were curious, not afraid. When they were not questioning me, they would play games with me to keep me from getting bored. Kate would come in at night with a book so that I could read her a bedtime story.

        Eventually, I recovered enough to travel and I was returned to our clan in a prisoner. I cried when I had to leave that family, knowing that I would likely never see them again.

          The lush forests and hot springs of Baker 3's southern continent, Lowa, have made it a recreation and tourism destination in the region for centuries. Khan Kerensky planned to use those same features to her advantage to devastate the defending Jade Falcon forces. While her main forces feinted a direct assault through the heavy forests near the Jade Falcon HQ, her remaining forces would approach the rear area by traveling directly up the Baker River. Because the Baker River was fed by numerous hot springs upriver, it would help mask the heat signatures of these units. Khan Kerensky hoped that a lightning assault on these rear areas would take the fight out of the Falcons.

        <desc>
          While the main body of the 12th Falcon Regulars is bottled up in Bright Basin, a trinary has broken through the main lines and is seeking to circle around and hit the Wolf forces from behind. Khan Kerensky has called in your unit to deal with the situation.
          
          ### Hegira/Retreat Conditions
          
          The 12th Falcon Regulars should request *hegira* if reduced to less than half their original force size while the player has more BV remaining. This can be simulated in MegaMek with the `/victory` command. If the player does not wish to grant *hegira*, then the bot settings for the 12th Falcon Regulars should be changed to RETREAT and they should begin a fighting withdrawal. In either case, the player can claim control of the battlefield for *isorla*.
          
          The player may receive *hegira* from the Falcon forces at any point by using the `/defeat` command in MegaMek. Players granted *hegira* cannot claim control of the battlefield. They can recover downed pilots, but not mechs or salvage.

          Your goal is to feint an attack against the Jade Falcons to get their forces to commit. You will be heavily outnumbered, so use the heavy woods to your advantage and make yourself a difficult target. To encourage their advance you must bleed their forces a little, before withdrawing with (hopefully) minimal damage.

          ### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

          Smelling blood, the Jade Falcon units will not grant *hegira*, nor will they ask for it. They will also not retreat. The player can only claim control of the battlefield if they destroy all opposing forces.

          After wading up the river bed of the Baker River, you have pulled steaming mechs out along the banks near your target. Your star has been assigned the task of taking out a nearby comm center and supply depot. Taking out any sentry units is an added bonus, but you will likely face heavy reinforcements if you remain in the field too long.

          Fortunately, the successful feint attack by the remaining forces has left only a token garrison force and some units are currently shut down and will not immediately enter the combat.

          ### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

          The Jade Falcon units are defending a critical strategic installation and will not retreat or ask for *hegira* while either building is still functional. Once the buildings are destroyed, the Jade Falcon forces will only attempt to retreat if their remaining BV is 50% or less that of the player's forces after round 12 when all available reinforcements have arrived.

          After wading up the river bed of the Baker River, you have pulled your steaming mechs out along the banks near your target. Your star has been assigned the task of taking out a nearby comm center and supply depot. Taking out any sentry units is an added bonus, but you will likely face heavy reinforcements if you remain in the field too long.

          Unfortunately, the Falons have not been fooled by the feint attack by your remaining forces and so the buildings are defended by a full Nova. Additional reinforcements may arrive if you take too long to meet your objectives.

          ### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

          The Jade Falcon units are defending a critical strategic installation and will not retreat or ask for *hegira* while either building is still functional. Once the buildings are destroyed, the Jade Falcon forces will only attempt to retreat if their remaining BV is 50% or less that of the player's forces after round 14 when all available reinforcements have arrived.
