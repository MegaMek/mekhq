# Young Wolves

In June 3057, tension between the Wolf and Jade Falcon clans led to the outbreak of the Refusal War. Khan
Elias Crichell of Clan Jade Falcon fought the war to destroy his most powerful rival to power. IlKhan Ulric
Kerensky fought the war to weaken the fighting capability of the Crusader movement and thus delay the resumption
of the drive to Terra. Far more than just a simple Trial of Refusal, the Refusal War at some point involved
virtually the entire Touman of both clans and would lead directly or indirectly to the death of four Khans and
 the death, rebirth and sundering of one clan. The war's implications would ripple out far from the original
belligerents to effect the balance of power in the Inner Sphere for a generation.

This is the story of a Trinary of young Wolf warriors eager to write their own line in the Remembrance through
glory and sacrifice. The Refusal War will test their resolve, skill, and, most importantly, their loyalty.

## Details

This story arc will take the user through the Clan Refusal War as a Wolf Star Captain. Most battles will involve
between a trinary and a star of units, although there will also be several possibilities for individual duels. All combat
will be mech only. Two main story endings are possible, depending on player choices.

This story arc is inspired by the Battletech novels *Bred for War* and *Malicious Intent* by Michael Stackpole, as well
as the *The Falcon and the Wolf Battletech Scenario Pack* by Rodney Knox. The arc is generally consistent with official
Battletech history, but some deviations have been made for narrative purposes.

            <title>Young Wolves Story Arc</title>
            <narrative>
In this story arc, you will lead a trinary of Wolf mechwarriors into battle during the Refusal War.
Momentarily you will create a character, but first I want to discuss some technical issues.

You will start on an existing campaign file with campaign options already set. You are welcome to
adjust many of those campaign settings to your own preferences, but you should keep in mind the
following for the best experience:

* You should have no access to additional units, parts, or personnel throughout the campaign, aside from
what is already stored in your warehouse and what you can salvage on the battlefield. The settings
are designed to reflect this fact.
* You should not earn money during the campaign. You are clan, you have no use of it.
* You should not take in prisoners and bondsmen during the campaign, except for possible narrative
exceptions.
* You can set MegaMek options as you like, but should consider two special cases:
    * Blind play is integral to many of the scenarios and should not be adjusted. By default, the bot will
      "cheat" and ignore double-blind. This prevents the bot from stalling out in the deployment zone. You can turn this
      "single-blind" feature off in the game options if you prefer.
    * Clan physical attacks are disabled for both you and your opponents. You can turn them on if you
      would prefer grittier and less honorable fights.
* Scenario objectives will in most cases be automatically determined, but you may have to check
custom objectives during scenario resolution in a few cases.
* In the scenario description, pay attention to the *hegira* conditions. These dictate whether you can
surrender to your opponents via a `defeat` command and if/when they will surrender to you allowing you
to declare victory with a `victory` command. Also pay attention to the rules there about when you can
claim a battlefield and thus salvage.

That's it. I hope you enjoy the campaign!

                You have been assigned to my task force for this offensive. Before we get started, let me ask you a
                simple question. Do you have a problem serving under a Khan older than your geneparents' geneparents
                and tainted by the Inner Sphere?

            <question>
                The Falcons are not taking the bait. There is no point to allowing them to grind us down in this damn
                sandstorm. I am ordering all forces back through the Great Gash. Proceed to your designated transports
                and begin transit to the Butler system where you will meet up with Star Colonel Ulric Kerensky for the
                final phase of this campaign.

                I will remain in the Great Gash to challenge all Falcon commanders to individual combat. If we can't
                destroy them all, at least we can cut off the head. Give them hell until the end, my wolves!

            <question>
                Did you hear that stravag woman's use of contractions? She is a disgrace to the clan. How dare she call
                herself a Wolf! She should have died honorably in a solahma unit years ago. Instead, she lives on as a

            <question>
                My task force departs for Wotan in one hour. There we will teach the Falcons a final lesson, although I
                do not expect to survive it. The remains of your task force are to join mine for this final battle.

                However, perhaps that is not the right path for you and your warriors. As you know, Khan Ward has taken
                many of our warriors with a Warden view into the Inner Sphere. They will live there in exile, helping to
                prepare the Spheroids for the end of the Tukayyid Truce.

                To live in exile is no easy thing and I would not force you to make such a decision. Yet, I cannot help
                but feel that you and your young pups have more to give to the cause. So I will give you the choice.
                Will you come to Wotan with me or will you join Khan Ward in exile?

            <question>
                *Tayyiba comes to see you later in your cabin.*

                I understand why you made the decision that you made to go to Wotan, {commander}. However, I cannot make
                the decision to die in futility when I can live to protect what I hold dear. I asked Star Colonel
                Ulric Kerensky for permission to join our fellow Wolves on Morges, which he has granted. The dropship
                transporting me to another jumpship will be arriving shortly.

                *You now notice the small bag over her shoulder.*

                I hope you find what you are looking for on Wotan, {commanderRank}.
            </question>
            <choice id="howl">I hope you find what you seek as well. Whatever happens may the howl of the Wolves never
                be silenced.

            <title>Negotiating the Trial</title>
            <question>
                *You have accepted Star Commander Mathius's challenge and the deck has been cleared of all other
                occupants while you await the arrival of an official to negotiate the trial. As you eye the still fuming
                Star Commander, your screen suddenly flickers to life, revealing the worn face of Star Colonel Marco
                Hall.*

                I understand that you have received and accepted a Trial of Refusal from Star Commander Mathius. I will
                be overseeing this trial.

                At the present moment, the logistics of finding a location for such a trial are not easy. However, the
                Falcons on Butler have agreed to grant safcon if you wish to have this trial on-planet, so long as only
                two mechs leave the ship. Apparently, some traditions are still honored even in the midst of this
                *dezgra* war.

                Since you are the defender, the choice of battlefield is yours, {commander}. Where would you like to
                meet Star Commander Mathius?
            </question>
            <choice id="glacier">I will meet him on the Thompkins mega-glacier in the polar wastes of the planet.
            </choice>

                Hello {commander}. I am glad to see it is you returning. Unfortunately, we have a bit of a situation
                here. After hearing the results of the trial, Ella was able to convince a few other warriors that it
                would be better to die in battle here against the Falcons than to go into exile with Khan Phelan. They
                were able to exit with their mechs before I was aware of the plan.

                *As she says this, you begin to hear the sounds of heavy weapons fire in the distance. The Falcons are
                likely enraged by this perceived violation of the truce. Going after these warriors would be suicide.*

            <question>
                Now that the war is over, we must turn our attention to rebuilding our forces. With the touman so
                reduced, there are sadly many {bloodname} bloodnames that have been left vacant. I would encourage you
                to claim one.

                Will you compete for a bloodname?

            <title>Which Mech?</title>
            <question>
                *You step into an assigned mech bay to prepare for the Trial and are surprised when your chief tech is
                there to greet you.*

                Greetings, {commander}. Since the battle, they have me working as a bondsman tech, but I was just
                ordered to get over to this mech bay on the double to support you for a Trial. Scuttlebut says it is to
                get our Clan back. I sure as hell hope so, because this Falcon jumpsuit itches like you would not
                believe.

                Anyway, first thing we need to do is get you a mech, since pretty much everything we had is in the
                salvage pile. Your opponent is going to be in a *Executioner* although I do not know the configuration.
                If you want to go for a similar assault mech, I could put you in a *Warhawk*. Alternatively, I could put
                you in something a little lighter, faster, and more iconic like the *Timber Wolf*. If you want to really
                go for speed, I can put you in a *Stormcrow* and you can try to run circles around him.

                So, what will it be?

                As you know, Ulric organized your ad-hoc trinary mostly from young and idealistic Wolf warriors. Your
                job is to whip them into a fighting force that can carry on the legacy of Clan Wolf, however this
                conflict ends. At the moment, I am not assigning you to a cluster but rather keeping you in my back
                pocket as a reserve force to be used as needed.

                I had hoped to keep you in that pocket a little longer, but the dezgra Falcons on Colmar have called in
                their reserve bid and are pushing through our lines in the Marakaa Valley. I need you to grab your command
                star and go plug some holes, immediately. Show these young pups what it means to be a warrior of Clan Wolf!

            <narrative>
                It looks like your pups cut some teeth today, {commanderRank}. As you saw, the Falcons are not honoring
                us with zellbrigen, so I would recommend that you return the favor for the foreseeable future.

                You are free to take bondsmen where you have the opportunity. However, keep in mind that such bondsmen
                are not allowed to join our ranks as warriors until after this war is over, except in special
                circumstances. Those are the Khan's orders. Given the enmity between our Clans, its unlikely many would
                want their bondcords cut anyway.

                I am happy to report that the Falcon presence on Colmar has been eliminated. I will be taking my Wolf
                Spiders to officially liberate the capital.

            <narrative>
                Hello, {commander}. I am the chief tech on board here. I see you have been out busting up my machines.
                Do not worry, my team can fix almost anything, so we will get right on it. You can head over to the
                repair bay to check on our progress.

                We have quite a few parts and equipment in storage aboard the ship, but keep in mind that once those
                supplies are used up, we do not have access to anything more, given wartime shortages. So if you want to
                make sure you stay in supply, you will want to be sure to salvage whatever isorla you can from your
                battles. You can always check on our supplies by heading over to the warehouse.

                Also keep in mind that we have no way to acquire new units given the situation. We do have some
                second-line mechs mothballed in the hangar bay, that can be used to replace units that have been
                completely destroyed or do not have available parts. It will take some time to pull those units out of
                mothball, though, so be sure to give me some advance warning.

                Hello, {commander}. Just be sure to let me know which units you are sending out on which assignments, so
                that I can get them ready to go. You can do that from your on-board TO&amp;E screen. You won't be able
                to start the assignments until you have assigned units to them.

            <narrative>
                Greetings, {commander}. I am the doctor assigned to the *Moonhowler*. If you have any wounded
                mechwarriors from this battle or future battles, be sure to send them to the infirmary so that I may
                treat them.

                I know that the ego of many mechwarriors is such that they are too proud to admit to their injuries, but
                it is imperative that they do so. If they are not sent to the infirmary, natural healing will take much
                longer.

                or even change your ride entirely.

                We will also be ready to repair your mech right after battle. If you don't bang it up too much, we
                should be able to get it ready for the next day's combat.

                Good luck, {commanderRank}.

            <narrative>
                Welcome to Baker 3, {commanderRank}! At this point, you have no doubt heard the rumors about Khan Ward's
                task force. After smashing the Falcons on Sudeten, his entire task force was diverted at my command to
                the Inner Sphere where they will help prepare the Spheroids for a resumption of hostilities with our
                brethren. He brought with him the entire genetic repository of our Clan.

                Like every other damn warrior in this Touman, you probably have your own opinions about my decision.
                Frankly, I don't give a damn. From an operational standpoint, all it means is that we will not
                have Khan Ward's forces available to us. I will, therefore, need to lean more heavily on my existing forces,
                including yours. In other words, I hope you got all the dents out of your mechs because I am going to
                need them shortly.

                We will be tackling Baker 3 with a two-pronged assault. Most of our forces will distract the Falcons
                with a straightforward assault. The remaining forces will use the heat of the hot spring-fed waters of
                the Baker River to march upriver and directly into the Falcon's rear area. I would like you to
                contribute a Star to each operation. You are welcome to choose which warriors to assign, but we will
                drop into the LZ in two hours, so get them ready now.

                The loss of supplies and communications from your successful mission has been particularly notable. It

                to leave the field so hastily, I am sending you back to your dropship for repair and resupply. Think on
                your failure and do better next time.

                Well, things have gone pear-shaped down on Devin. It seems the Falcons knew a big storm was coming on
                and used that to their advantage on the O'Tsung Plain. Our forces are making a fighting withdrawal to
                their dropships. I need you to make a combat drop near the front lines and hold off the Falcons long
                enough to evacuate as many of our forces as we can. We are not going to win this one {commander}, but we
                may be able to turn a killing blow into a flesh wound if your young pups have the mettle to see it
                through.

                sure everything is secured in the hangar bay, and we will try to get you down in one piece.

                *Shortly after, you are buffeted about in your combat seat from the heavy winds hitting the descending
                dropship.*

                Bring us down tight and steady, pilot! You flip this egg, and you pay for it!

                *You can hear the metal struts supporting the hull groan with the pressure. Then you feel an abrupt and
                heavy jerk as your mech rocks on its actuators. As the bay doors begin to open, sand is blown across the
                metal floors of the hangar bay by the howling winds outside.*

                And that is touchdown! You are clear for egress, {commanderRank}. Good hunting!

                There is an important oil refinery in the northern continent that is being guarded by a small garrison
                unit. The commander of that force is ... well, best you see for yourself. I am assigning your forces to
                take that facility. I'm also giving you free rein to handle it as you see fit.

                bolster the morale of your troops. They are going to need it because Twycross is going to be a lot harder

                A very honorable decision, {commanderRank} to fight the opponent with equal forces when you could have

                tactical error when it matters. Speaking of which, we are off to Twycross where we will face a far more
                fearsome foe than an old man with a taste for ancient legends. Prepare for liftoff.

                Welcome to Twycross, {commander}, site of the Jade Falcon's greatest shame. I think we should make them
                relive that trauma.

                With battle attrition, our forces are worn a bit thin, so I am putting you in the front-line for the
                coming battle. The plan is simple. We will invite the Falcons to attack our forces on the Plain of
                Curtains in front of the Great Gash. Once the emerald birds are fully engaged, we will withdraw through
                the Gash. When they follow us, the warriors I have placed at strategic points throughout the Great Gash
                will rain fire down upon them. I realize some may find it a dishonorable tactic, but I don't really
                care. Suit up and prepare to form up on my left flank.

            <narrative>
                Excellent work, {commanderRank}. With their supply line cut, the Falcon mechs started running dry, and we
                pushed them all the way back to their rally point at the Bay of Broken Hope.

                Now I have something special planned for the Falcons. You should join my forces as we march on the Bay
                of Broken Hope. I will speak with you more once we arrive.

                Unfortunately, enough of the convoy survived to keep the Falcon fighting for a little longer. It cost me
                more than I would have liked, but we finally were able to push them back.

                They are regrouping at the Bay of Broken Hope. Before they launch their next offensive, I have something
                special planned. You should join my forces as we march on the Bay of Broken Hope. I will speak with you

                *Ulric's face flickers onto your screen and the screen of every member of this strike force.*

                We have arrived at Wotan. As I predicted, we have caught the Jade Falcons by surprise. Lacking the guile
                of the Wolves, they could not envision such a bold maneuver.

                We will keep them off-guard by immediately dropping everything we have onto Wotan. The goal is the
                elimination of the remaining Jade Falcons as a viable fighting force. I don't expect that many of us
                will survive this fight, but our sacrifice will ensure the survival of Clan Wolf. The Wolves will live
                on, even if the Wolf dies. Go with honor, my trothkin, and earn your place in the Remembrance.

                Sorry, {commanderRank}. The drop zone is a little hot right now, but nothing I cannot handle. We should
                be landing shortly.

                *G-forces push you into your seat as the thunder of engines tells you that you are coming in for a
                landing. After minutes, you feel the g-forces lift, followed by the familiar sound of the dropship

                two.

                I am Natasha Kerensky of Clan Wolf. I have sent my troops away. I await in the Great Gash of Twycross to
                meet and slay any Jade Falcon who thinks more of himself than he should and prefers courage to wisdom.
                Come now. Your time is at hand.

                *As you oversee the boarding of your trinary's mechs into the *Moonhowler*, you feel a mixture of pride

                I was deeply saddened to hear of Khan Kerensky's death on Twycross. It is, however, some consolation
                that she met a warrior's end and certainly earned a place in the Remembrance.

                She spoke highly of your abilities in combat, and I believe it is due in part to you that Twycross did
                not turn out worse for our forces. For that, you have my respect and gratitude.

                I am glad to see that this campaign has given you some measure of wisdom. Khan Kerensky's death is truly
                a great loss for our clan, but we must push on. Her sacrifice will not be the last, I am afraid.

                *Chistu looks disparagingly at Vlad.*

                However, I cannot fight a crippled warrior, nor wait for your recovery. I must fight your second

            <narrative>
                *Tayyiba nods her head vigorously.*

                Without Natasha Kerensky and Phelan Ward, I believe that we would have failed on Tukkayid like so many
                other clans. They showed us the importance of being flexible and adaptable. Being stuck in one's ways is
                a recipe for defeat, quiaff? I learned that on Tukkayid, as well, in a more personal way.

                *Tayyiba shakes her head.*

                But without Natasha Kerensky and Phelan Ward, surely we would have lost! There is no dishonor in
                learning to adapt to the enemy that one faces. Being stuck in one's ways is a recipe for defeat, quiaff?
                I learned that on Tukkayid, as well, in a more personal way.

            <narrative>
                My unit, the third Battle Cluster was tasked with garrison duty when our forces pulled back to re-supply
                before the assault on Brzo. We did not expect the Comguards to hit us, but that is exactly what they
                did. Multiple divisions ambushed us. We were outnumbered three to one. We fought like hell and dished
                out more than we took, but we were decimated. I blacked out after my second ammo bin popped off.

                When I came to, I was lying in the bedroom of a small farmhouse not far from the fighting. Apparently, I
                had dragged myself several miles from the battlefield before collapsing in an agricultural drainage
                ditch, although I remember none of it. A local farming family found me and took me in.

            <narrative>
                They did not care that I was the enemy. I was just a person in need of help. They nursed me back to
                health. They had two children named Kate and Tynan. They would sit at the foot of my bed and
                ask me questions about life in the Clans for hours. They were curious, not afraid. When they were not
                questioning me, they would play games with me to keep me from getting bored. Kate would come in at night
                with a book so that I could read her a bedtime story.

                Eventually, I recovered enough to travel, and I was returned to our clan in a prisoner exchange. I felt a
                pit in my stomach when I had to leave that family, knowing that I would likely never see them again.

            <title>Cut Their Supply Lines</title>
            <narrative>
                As promised {commanderRank}, I have returned with new orders that should bust this dance wide open.

                The Jade Falcons have been pushing us hard since their loss at Icegrief Pass. They are loaded with
                ballistic
                weaponry for maximum destructive effect and it has been effective. However, they are now running low on
                ammunition.

                Earlier today, the Kell Hounds intercepted a transmission indicating that a re-supply convoy was on its
                way
                from Broken Hope to Carson Rift to deliver much needed ammunition to the front line Falcon units. I
                can't spare many units for
                such a deep strike mission and moving troops from the front line might alert the Falcons to our intent.
                You,
                however, are new here and will likely be able to slip behind enemy lines and strike this convoy before
                it
                reaches Carson Rift.

                The convoy will likely be well guarded, but those guards will be
                second line forces. Thus, I expect your battle hardened troops to make short work of them. Suit up,
                {commander}, I want you on the move in 30 minutes!

            <narrative>
                *Phelan waits for you on a bluff overlooking the Bay of Broken Hope. You can see Jade Falcon technicians
                and mechwarriors running frantically throughout the camp below as they prepare for the coming onslaught
                of Wolves. Ice and snow lie gleaming upon the bulbous tops of Jade Falcon dropships.*

                Thank you for meeting me here. I wanted to show you something. We lost Tukkayid because the Inner Sphere
                understands the concept of Total War, but we do not. Today, I will teach that lesson to the Jade Falcons
                again.

                *Suddenly, you hear the roar of jet engines above and look up to see the contrails of aerospace fighters
                diving toward the bay. The sky is filled with Wolf aerospace fighters.*

                *Jade Falcon fighters launch from their dropships to meet these intruders in the sky. For minutes, the
                sky is a tangled mass of fighters, twisting and turning for advantage, as they stab at one another with
                PPC, laser, and missile.*

                *Quickly, however, the Jade Falcons are overwhelmed by their numerical disadvantage, when multiple
                flights of Kell Hounds fighters join the fray. Freed from their aerial concerns, the Wolf fighters begin
                to strafe the camp. Explosions ripple through the camp, tearing apart flesh and steel. Realizing their
                exposed position, the Jade Falcons attempt to evacuate, but only one dropship makes it into the air,
                where it is torn apart by the combined Kell Hound fire.*

                *Finally, the Wolf fighters cease their onslaught. A thick black fog hangs over the Jade Falcon camp,
                partially concealing a scene of utter devastation. The twisted remains of mechs litter the ground, and
                survivors are seen limping here and there among the ruins.*

                I understand, although I am disappointed. Clan Wolf is in need of leadership and leadership demands a
                bloodname. Perhaps after some time to rest and recuperate, you will reconsider. It will take time to
                organize so many trials anyway.

                The war is over, {commanderRank}. I release you to your unit to rest and repair. Once we have dealt with
                the immediate aftermath of this war, I will call the Clan together for a final Kurultai to mark the
                occasion.

                Yet, Khan Vandervahn Chistu claimed, after murdering Ulric Kerensky on Wotan, that *our* Trial of
                Refusal was, instead, *their* Trial of Absorption.

                *The crowd erupts in cries of confusion and disbelief. Phelan quiets them with a hand.*

                Thankfully, among the survivors of Wotan was one Wolf warrior named Vlad. He witnessed the treachery of
                Khan Chistu, firsthand, when he murdered Ulric Kerensky. He challenged Chistu to a Trial of Refusal over
                the absorption. Chistu was forced to accept and was slain in the fight.

                instead has dubbed these surviving Wolves as members of a new Jade Wolf Clan. Vlad was subsequently
                awarded a bloodname. Specifically, he was awarded *my* bloodname, for I, like all of you, have been
                *abjured.*

                *The crowd erupts again into murmurs of discontent, before being quieted.*

                The Jade Falcons have disowned us. The Jade Wolves will not claim us. Yet, in my heart, I know that we
                are the true Wolves. We will be the Wolves forever, and we will honor the vision of those who created
                the clans.

                You mission is now to defend the Inner Sphere from the threat represented by the Clans. Who else could
                it be? You must stand united against the Crusaders on their path to destruction. You have Khan
                Phelan Kell to lead you and the courage to follow.

                This is your destiny as Wolves and from it, you shall not shy.

                *As Ulric's image fades out, the entire auditorium is momentarily silent. Then a single word spoken in
                absolute unity echoes out from every throat.*

                Seyla!

                Of course, it is your right to commit what forces you wish, but little honor will come to the coward that
                simply overwhelms his opponent with superior numbers.

                Perhaps I can offer an alternative that will restore your tattered honor. I propose we do as they did in
                the olden days. I have read much in my time as garrison commander, and I am particularly drawn to the
                stories of Greek history. Have you ever read of the fall of Troy by Homer? No, probably not I am
                guessing. There, the men fought honorably in one on one duels each striving to slay the other and claim
                more honor for himself. These duels were repeated over and over until one side proved victorious. This
                is how the Founder envisioned combat among the clans -- not these nasty, brutish affairs, but a series
                of singular trials in which each warrior could prove his might against the other. It harkens back not
                just to our heritage in the Clans, but indeed to all humankind.

                I am rambling. This is what I suggest. Nine of my warriors will pair off in single challenges with a
                warrior from your side. Whichever side achieves the greatest number of victories in single combat will
                be proclaimed the victor.

                You are an honorable warrior to offer to fight me on equal terms when you could simply push your

                Time is of the essence, and we must not bicker any longer. We will *both* lead the way, {commander}. You
                may take point, while I guard the rear.

                *As you head forth, Vlad cannot avoid one final reminder of his authority.*

                Keep your head on a swivel, folks.

                between their legs have been Abjured. If the remaining Wolves are Absorbed, then Clan Wolf will cease to
                exist. You and I are going to ensure that does not happen.

                *Vlad offers a predatory smile.*

                He assumed I was dead, after being buried under a building. He ordered his troops to kill you and your
                forces to the last pilot. In this, he underestimated the resolve of the Wolf.

                I survived and was freed by a salvage team. You fought so bravely that you earned the respect of the
                Star Colonel leading the assault. He refused to kill your warriors needlessly.

                Greetings, {commander}. I have been chosen to serve in the role of Loremaster until a permanent
                replacement is found. It is therefore my duty to inform you that you have been nominated to participate
                in a trial of bloodright for the {bloodname} bloodname. The documents I have with me should indicate
                that this is a particularly prestigious bloodheritage, and thus I expect no objection to such a
                nomination, quiaff?

                *He pauses briefly, before continuing.*

                Due to shortages of manpower, we have less than the normal 32 participants for this trial. You have
                therefore been seeded to join the competition in the second round. You will have to win four consecutive
                rounds of combat to emerge as the ultimate victor.

                Your first battle is scheduled for tomorrow. Each of the subsequent battles will be a day apart,
                allowing you some time for repair, if necessary. I will next see you at the trial, {commanderRank}. May
                your skill prove your worth.

                As you pull down on your firing triggers, immense energies stab from your weapons into Mathius's
                cockpit. Within seconds, the cockpit is turned into slag and whatever was within it has been cooked
                alive or atomized.

                You stand for a moment in contemplation as your weapons cycle and cool. You note movement out of the
                corner of your eye and look up to see several Jade Falcon mechs approaching. Fearing a trap, you begin
                cycling your weapons online before realizing that the Jade Falcons do not have weapons raised and
                instead their mechs have formed something like a circle of equals. Slowly, they bow their heads in
                recognition of a warrior's life lost in the honorable combat of a trial of refusal. Then without a word,
                they salute your mech and withdraw.

                As the salvage crews arrive to recover what is left of Mathius's mech, you return slowly to the
                *Moonhowler*.

            <title>Death of a Warrior</title>
            <narrative>
                As the battle abruptly dies out, you look at the battered remains of Mathius's mech. There is no
                movement from the crushed cockpit. It appears that Mathius did not survive the trial.

                You stand for a moment in contemplation as your weapons cycle and cool. You note movement out of the
                corner of your eye and look up to see several Jade Falcon mechs approaching. Fearing a trap, you begin
                cycling your weapons online before realizing that the Jade Falcons do not have weapons raised and
                instead their mechs have formed something like a circle of equals. Slowly, they bow their heads in
                recognition of a warrior's life lost in the honorable combat of a trial of refusal. Then without a word,
                they salute your mech and withdraw.

                As the salvage crews arrive to recover what is left of Mathius's mech, you return slowly to the
                *Moonhowler*.

            <narrative>
                What!? Have it your way then! I would rather serve as an astech in a true clan than with *dezgra* exiles
                who have forsaken the way of the clans. Mark my words, I will become an *abtakha* of the Jade Falcons
                and when I do I will come looking for you. You hear me? This isn't over. I will--

                *You turn off your comms at this point and begin trudging back to the *Moonhowler*. Your rear camera
                shows you that several Jade Falcon mechs that were apparently stationed as observers have begun to move
                forward. What they will do with Mathius, you do not know.*

                {commander}, it looks like there is some kind of interpersonal conflict in the mess. I think you are
                going to need to check it out.

                *Sighing, you get out of your bunk, straighten up your jacket, and take the lift down to the mess.*

                *You arrive to see a crowd surrounding two of your mechwarriors who are standing off from one another,
                with hostile intent mirrored in their eyes. You see that each is holding a long combat knife.*

                You hear murmuring across the deck. With tensions running high since Khan Phelan's departure, it is
                clear that some were looking forward to a violent outlet. After giving you a hard stare, both of the
                belligerents sheathe their weapons and depart. The rest of the crowd then slowly dissipates.

                You have resolved the conflict for the moment, but you do not know what consequences it may have for
                long term morale.

                A cheer rises from the crowd. Tensions have been running high since Khan Phelan's departure, and this
                event promises to at least vicariously satiate their need for violence.

                A Circle of Equals is quickly formed as tables are pushed to the side. The two main belligerents square
                off, each in a crouching position with their knife held at the ready. With a cry, they simultaneously
                move to the attack.

            <narrative>
                Every sibko trains extensively for these kinds of fights. With practiced ease, Felipe and Ella dance
                around the Circle of Equals, each attempting to bait the other into an overreach with quick jabs. The
                crowd shouts and jeers, encouraging them to fully let loose.

                Finally, Ella decides to go for the kill. After a quick feinting movement, she lunges in and tackles
                Felipe around the midsection, knocking him to the floor. She quickly straddles him as he attempts to
                escape her grasp and begins pummeling him in the face. With her superior size, Felipe is not able to
                escape and after several savage strikes, his bloodied head dips to the floor.

                Ella pulls back her fist to continue the assault, but is quickly pulled off of Felipe's sprawling body
                by her peers. She is toasted with cheers by many of the other warriors for calling out Khan Phelan's
                cowardice, while Felipe is rushed off to the medical bay.

                It appears that the conflict has been resolved without loss of life. What other consequences may come of

                tackle Felipe around the midsection. At the last second, Felipe recognizes the feint and with
                astonishing agility turns his movement into a roundhouse kick that catches Ella in the face. She falls
                to her knees, stunned and dazed, blood oozing from her broken nose.

                Before she has a chance to recover, Felipe lunges in with a fierce upper cut that knocks Ella back into
                the tables ringing the Circle of Equals. Amid the clatter of tables and chairs overturning, her limp
                body hits the floor and does not rise.

                Felipe is toasted with cheers by many of the other warriors for standing up for the Khan, while Ella is

                Seeking to break the stalemate, Felipe darts in for a quick slash, but at the last second drops low for
                a sweeping attack. Ella is prepared for such deception, however, and leaps over his sweeping legs.
                Seeing an opportunity, she brings her knife down to skewer his now exposed body, but Felipe rolls out of
                the way at the last second and her knife bounces off the metal flooring of the mess hall. Quickly
                rebounding, she spins 180 degrees and catches Felipe with her knife as he rises up and begins
                backpedaling out of the way. A deep red cut blooms across Felipe's abdomen, and he pauses momentarily to
                feel his midsection.

                chin with her elbow. Felipe drops like a rock.

                With a bloodcurdling cry, Ella moves into finish off her prey, but other warriors surround her and pull
                her back. You hear shouts of "first blood!" as the winner is declared. Ella is toasted with cheers by

                Felipe's chin. The blade sinks all the way into the hilt, clearly slicing directly into Felipe's brain.
                He drops like a load of bricks to the floor, dead.

                There is a moment of stunned silence before the mess hall erupts in both cheers and groans. Despite (or
                perhaps because of) the lethal outcome, Ella is toasted with cheers by many of the other warriors for

            <narrative>
                Ella screams with rage and pain and throws Felipe off of her. She gets up, grunting with pain and woozy
                with blood loss, while Felipe paces around her, waiting for another opportunity. Realizing she must end
                the fight soon if she hopes to win. Ella charges Felipe hoping to take him by surprise. Felipe is ready,
                however, and with a deft movement, throws his knife at the charging Ella. It catches her in the neck,
                cutting off her windpipe. She tumbles to the floor and feebly attempts to pull it out as her lifeblood
                gushes from her wound before going still.

                There is a moment of stunned silence before the mess hall erupts in both cheers and groans. Despite (or
                perhaps because of) the lethal outcome, Felipe is toasted with cheers by many of the other warriors for
                defending Khan Phelan's honor, while medtechs arrive to deal with Ella's corpse.

                It appears that the conflict has been resolved, but not without a terrible price. What other
                consequences may come of it, you know not.

                    and tourism destination in the region for centuries. Khan Kerensky planned to use those same
                    features to her advantage to devastate the defending Jade Falcon forces. While her main forces
                    feinted a direct assault through the heavy forests near the Jade Falcon HQ, her remaining forces
                    would approach the rear area by traveling directly up the Baker River. Because the Baker River was
                    fed by numerous hot springs upriver, it would help mask the heat signatures of these units. Khan
                    Kerensky hoped that a lightning assault on these rear areas would take the fight out of the Falcons.

                    A jumpship sail array mishap delayed the start of the Devin campaign, suggesting ill omen for the
                    assault. The desert planet itself was a foreboding place, raging with windstorms and electrical
                    interference.

                    Khan Kerensky deployed her few remaining fresh clusters to the attack. It would prove to be a
                    disastrous assault.

While the main body of the 12th Falcon Regulars is bottled up in Bright Basin, a trinary has broken
through the main lines and is seeking to circle around and hit the Wolf forces from behind. Khan
Kerensky has called in your unit to deal with the situation.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The 12th Falcon Regulars should ask for *hegira* if reduced to less than half their original force
size while the player has more BV remaining. This can be simulated in MegaMek with the `/victory`
command. If the player does not wish to grant *hegira*, then the bot settings for the 12th Falcon
Regulars should be changed to RETREAT, and they should begin a fighting withdrawal. In either case,
the player can claim control of the battlefield for *isorla*.

The player may be granted *hegira* from the Falcon forces at any point by using the `/defeat`
command in MegaMek. Players granted *hegira* cannot claim control of the battlefield. They can
recover downed pilots, but not mechs or salvage.

Your goal is to feint an attack against the Jade Falcons to get their forces to commit. You will be
heavily outnumbered, so use the heavy woods to your advantage and make yourself a difficult target.
To encourage their advance you must bleed their forces a little, before withdrawing with (hopefully)
minimal damage.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Smelling blood, the Jade Falcon units will not grant *hegira*, nor will they ask for it. They will
also not retreat. The player can only claim control of the battlefield if they destroy all opposing
forces.

After wading up the river bed of the Baker River, you have pulled steaming mechs out along the banks
near your target. Your star has been assigned the task of taking out a nearby comm center and supply
depot. Taking out any sentry units is an added bonus, but you will likely face heavy reinforcements
if you remain in the field too long. So meet your objectives and get out.

Fortunately, the successful feint attack by the remaining forces has left only a token garrison
force and some units are currently shut down and will not immediately enter the combat.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The Jade Falcon units are defending a critical strategic installation and will not retreat or ask
for *hegira* while either building is still functional. Once the buildings are destroyed, the Jade
Falcon forces will only attempt to retreat if their remaining BV is 50% or less that of the player's
forces after round 12 when all available reinforcements have arrived.

After wading up the river bed of the Baker River, you have pulled your steaming mechs out along the
banks near your target. Your star has been assigned the task of taking out a nearby comm center and
supply depot. Taking out any sentry units is an added bonus, but you will likely face heavy
reinforcements if you remain in the field too long. So meet your objectives and get out.

Unfortunately, the Falons have not been fooled by the feint attack by your remaining forces and so
the buildings are defended by a full Nova. Additional reinforcements may arrive if you take too long
to meet your objectives.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The Jade Falcon units are defending a critical strategic installation and will not retreat or ask
for *hegira* while either building is still functional. Once the buildings are destroyed, the Jade
Falcon forces will only attempt to retreat if their remaining BV is 50% or less that of the player's
forces after round 14 when all available reinforcements have arrived.

Your goal is to prevent the Jade Falcons from breaking through your lines and pursuing the remaining
Wolf forces. You are heavily outnumbered, but the enemy forces are spread out and will come in
waves. If you can hold out long enough, you can then retreat to your dropship.

The weather on the O'Tsung Plain is hellish. A sandstorm combined with lightning strikes will make
your sensors almost worthless. Visual range will be low and targeting systems will be non-optimal,
limiting most combat to knife-fighting range.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Jade Falcon units will operate under forced withdrawal but will not ask for *hegira*, although they
will grant it. Given the difficult situation, the player will not be able to claim battlefield
salvage.

The trial for this facility will be fought in the arctic wastelands at the northern extremity of the
facility. Try not to damage the facilities themselves as the Wolves would like to be able to make
use of them.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The Jade Falcon units will grant hegira but not ask for it and they will continue to fight until all units are destroyed.

The trial for this facility will be fought in the arctic wastelands at the northern extremity of the
facility. Try not to damage the facilities themselves as the Wolves would like to be able to make

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The Jade Falcon units will grant hegira but not ask for it and they will continue to fight until all units are destroyed.

In this trial, you will face Warrior Konstantin, piloting a *Hellbringer* in its prime
configuration. Honor would dictate that you respond with a mech of a similar weight class, but you
are not required to do so.

Keep in mind that you may only claim *isorla* in trials that you win, even if you succeed in
capturing the facility.

In this trial, you will face Warrior Gunter, a solahma warrior piloting a *Highlander IIC*. Honor
would dictate that you respond with a mech of a similar weight class, but you are not required to do
so.

Keep in mind that you may only claim *isorla* in trials that you win, even if you succeed in
capturing the facility.

In this trial, you will face Warrior Hyacinth, a freebirth warrior piloting a *Locust IIC*. Honor
would dictate that you respond with a mech of a similar weight class, but you are not required to do
so.

Keep in mind that you may only claim *isorla* in trials that you win, even if you succeed in
capturing the facility.

You are the bait. Your job is to do enough damage to get the falcons to chase you back through the
Great Gash.

The red sands of the Plain of Curtains make for a challenging battlefield. Erratic winds can

Jade Falcon units will operate under forced withdrawal but will not ask for nor grant *hegira*. The wolf forces must withdraw and will not be able to claim battlefield salvage.

SaKhan Phelan Ward is under heavy assault from Jade Falcon forces!
You must combat drop behind them with everything you have to save the Khan.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The Jade Falcon forces should ask for *hegira* if reduced to less
than half their original force size while the player has more BV
remaining. This can be simulated in MegaMek with the `/victory`
command. If the player does not wish to grant *hegira*, then the
bot settings for the Jade Falcons should be changed to RETREAT, and
they should begin a fighting withdrawal. In either case, the
player can claim control of the battlefield for *isorla*.

The player will not be granted *hegira* by the Jade Falcons.

You must destroy the supply convoy heading towards Broken Hope. To avoid detection, you will be
limited to two stars of mechs.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Jade Falcon forces will not retreat or ask for Hegira under any conditions, but individual units
will operate under forced withdrawal conditions. They will grant hegira. Due to the nature of this
strike, you will not be able to claim battlefield salvage.

The treacherous Vandervahn Chistu has murdered Ulric Kerensky! Now he is sending a wave of enemies
at you to remove the evidence. You are unlikely to defeat them all, but you will fight like a Wolf.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

The Jade Falcons will not ask for or grant *hegira*. They will operate under forced withdrawal. Due
to the nature of the scenario, you may not collect *isorla.*

If you fail the mission but your commander is not killed, do not check your commander as MIA in the
scenario resolution.

Due to the small number of participants, you were seeded directly into round two.

In this round, you face a warrior named Aziza who is even older than you. Assigned to a second line
mech in a garrison cluster, she nonetheless proved herself in battle upon Morges, earning a
nomination for this trial.

Aziza pilots an ancient second line *Warhammer IIC* that still presents a formidable threat.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Aziza will yield the contest if her mech is crippled and your mech is not. You may surrender at any point. You cannot salvage her mech.

Your opponent in this round is a brash, young mechwarrior named Damien. What he lacks for in
experience, he makes up for in enthusiasm. He likes speed and will be bringing a jump-capable
*Shadow Cat*. Make sure you don't let him run (or jump) circles around you.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Damien will yield the contest if his mech is crippled and your mech is not. You may surrender at any point. You cannot salvage his mech.

You have made it to the semi-finals. Your opponent in this round is Star Commander Jameel. He is an
experienced mechwarrior. He will be piloting a *Summoner C*. I am sure you realize this means a
heavy ultra auto-cannon in the left arm. If you let him in too close, he can end this trial very
quickly.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Jameel will yield the contest if his mech is crippled and your mech is not. You may surrender at any point. You cannot salvage his mech.

This is it - the finals. Win today and the bloodname is yours. That will not be easy, however. Your
opponent is Star Captain Olympia. She is an experienced mechwarrior and considered something of a
tactical genius. She will be piloting an *Executioner* in its A configuration, which means lots of
lasers.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

Having reached the finals, Olympia will not surrender until her mech is destroyed. You may surrender at any point. You cannot salvage her mech.

You can hear the roar of the crowd. Many have gathered here to watch this epic battle between
yourself and saKhan Vandervahn Chistu. Among the spectators will be many who were formerly of Clan
Wolf and would like nothing better than to return.

It is time to suit up and finish this.

### Hegira/Retreat Conditions

There is no surrender or hegira available in this battle. You must fight until one combatant's mech is destroyed. You cannot salvage Chistu's mech.
