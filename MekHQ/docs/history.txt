    This had actually been disabled on purpose pending a fix to an infinite loop bug in the code that is used to generate
    proper crews for multi-crewed vehicles.

    Now all entities on the field are places as potential salvage and there is a new checkbox
    for having them escape (they won't count in terms of salvage value either way) from the
    battle. I chose this route because otherwise it would not allow the next part. That next
    part is that enemy personnel are now loaded into MekHQ's end screen and you have 3 options
    with them: prisoner, bondsman, escaped.

    While this wasn't actually a bug as written, I found that the code for automatically assigning techs for small craft, dropships,
    and jumpships was in the wrong place. Now that it's moved, the Ships' crews will automatically be assigned to their repairs and
    complete them. No longer will you need to manually start the repairs.
+ Feature: Adjusted the campaign.newDay() repair code again from bug #464 in order to allow manual prioritization of the repairs
    When you first resolve you can manually start a repair. That repair will be prioritized as first. Each time a component completes,

  There are now four methods of randomization to choose from.
  Dylan's method and the Random (original implementation) method both generate daily, but don't "clear"
  Dylan's method uses a weighted version of the Random method to frequently choose personnel for your most common unit type(s)
  Random method is totally random, though it now has options on how personnel are removed based on roll on 2d6 (if it's less than that target)
  FM:Mercs Revised method is as close as I could code to what that book offers with a couple of TODO for roll modifiers
  StratOps method follows the rules in StratOps based on whatever you set your Maint. Cycle as
