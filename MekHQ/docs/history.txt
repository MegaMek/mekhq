    Additionally this immplements Improved Ferro-Aluminum, Ferro-Carbide, and Lamellor Ferro-Carbide. In order to implement
    those a new MM.jar file was also required.
+ Bug [#430]: Straight support calculation error
+ Bug [#438]: Unable to load .mul
    This had actually been disabled on purpose pending a fix to an infinite loop bug in the code that is used to generate
    proper crews for multi-crewed vehicles.
+ Bug [#442]: GM Tools: Dice Roll gives nothing above 10
    This also includes a new mekhq.Utilities method dice(num, faces) that will roll any number of any size dice.

+ Bug [#449]: Procurement List link error
+ Broke out pieces of the PersonnelReport same as the HangarReport
+ Bug: New LaunchGameDialog NPE
+ Bug [#233]: Campaign resolve NPE when you have extra units
    This vastly changed the resolution process, especially for games played via MekHQ.
    Now all entities on the field are places as potential salvage and there is a new checkbox
    for having them escape (they won't count in terms of salvage value either way) from the
    battle. I chose this route because otherwise it would not allow the next part. That next
    part is that enemy personnel are now loaded into MekHQ's end screen and you have 3 options
    with them: prisoner, bondsman, escaped.
+ RFE [#89]: Unofficial - Exclude Infantry from Contract Pay

+ Bug: Injury.generateHealingTime() was being called in some places with the arguments out of order, leading to incorrect times.
+ Special Ability object and affiliated files - this allows for specifying a variety of restrictions on special abilities for pilots
+ Bug [#464]: Repiar: Small Craft
    While this wasn't actually a bug as written, I found that the code for automatically assigning techs for small craft, dropships,
    and jumpships was in the wrong place. Now that it's moved, the Ships' crews will automatically be assigned to their repairs and
    complete them. No longer will you need to manually start the repairs.
+ Feature: Adjusted the campaign.newDay() repair code again from bug #464 in order to allow manual prioritization of the repairs
    When you first resolve you can manually start a repair. That repair will be prioritized as first. Each time a component completes,
    you can manually start another to have it be the next, or let the rest be handled by the auto-system

+ Bug: ranksTable Exception when removing a rank leaves no ranks in the table

    A very complex addition. Please see the instructions for customizing ranks in the Campaign Options - Rank System
+ Bug/Data: Corrected and Added to the included rank systems in MekHQ
-    Due to corrections the ranks in player campaigns could now be off. Please sanity check your ranks against your

    of the controlling factions and such as well.
+ RFE [#118]: Sub Rank Fields & Ranks by Profession - pt2

+ Bug: New rank system not translating due to static defines used as constants changing order
+ Implemented new Version.versionCompare() method, with several overloads including both static and non-static versions
+ Bug: New rank system was still writing out ranks for the stock systems. As these systems are no longer editable, we don't need to do this
+ Bug: When editing ranks, it should automatically change the ranks dropdown to Custom and the canon ranks should not be editable
+ Data: Added more canon rank systems (Several periphery realms and the FRR)
+ RFE: Added rank levels

+ Bug: All units receiving an "empty" (default Blue) individual camo - This was due to a bug in MegaMek actually
+ Bug: Rank type choice not loading correctly from the campaign file
+ Bug: Dialog for choosing proper rank system is displaying twice
    This was due to processInfoNode() being called twice when loading the campaign file;
    which is not necessary. This was probably an oversight. The second loading is now commented out
+ Bug: Most professions could not change their rank due to a missing ranks.isEmptyProfession() check
+ Bug: Hire personnel & Bulk Hire had rank issues

+ Bug [#471]: Captured Mechwarriors, Escaped Salvages??
+ Bug [#426]: Aerospace fighters showing "undamaged" after combat; ferro-aluminum armor missing
    To fix this bug I dumped the MekHQ versions of undamaged, light damage, heavy damage, and crippled

+ Implemented parts loot (Just a quick hack to make it work, full re-write to be like Units will be for Taharqa if he wants)
+ Bug [#398]: Assigning Tech to Large Craft Maintenance
+ Bug: assigning of techs to Small Craft maintenance and repair confused - should always use Aero tech

  There are now four methods of randomization to choose from.
  Dylan's method and the Random (original implementation) method both generate daily, but don't "clear"
  Dylan's method uses a weighted version of the Random method to frequently choose personnel for your most common unit type(s)
  Random method is totally random, though it now has options on how personnel are removed based on roll on 2d6 (if it's less than that target)
  FM:Mercs Revised method is as close as I could code to what that book offers with a couple of TODO for roll modifiers
  StratOps method follows the rules in StratOps based on whatever you set your Maint. Cycle as
