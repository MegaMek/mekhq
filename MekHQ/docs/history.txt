  - On Integrated command, don't immediately and incorrectly undeploy lances after generating scenarios
  - Adjusted manual force deployment rules (unlimited stacking on allied facilities, one per hex otherwise, no manual deployment under integrated command)
  - Tighten up reinforcement restrictions (can't deploy units that can't actually deploy; can't double deploy units; can now only deploy fight lances or have to use a support point/VP)
  - VTOLs no longer start on the ground in certain situations, for real
  - Removed extraneous "recon turrets" modifier span for recon raid contracts
  - Tighten up strategic objective generation; correct objective coordinate display
  - Removed extraneous references to contract score in some scenario modifiers; water-naval units may rarely make an appearance
  - More robust transport loading code
  - Bot now has access to Arrow IV external ordnance, won't load 20 TAG pods on a single fighter.
  - Prevent double deployment of units and forces to individual scenarios

    Additionally this immplements Improved Ferro-Aluminum, Ferro-Carbide, and Lamellor Ferro-Carbide. In order to implement
    those a new MM.jar file was also required.
+ Bug [#430]: Straight support calculation error

    This had actually been disabled on purpose pending a fix to an infinite loop bug in the code that is used to generate
    proper crews for multi-crewed vehicles.

+ Broke out pieces of the PersonnelReport same as the HangarReport
+ Bug: New LaunchGameDialog NPE
+ Bug [#233]: Campaign resolve NPE when you have extra units
    This vastly changed the resolution process, especially for games played via MekHQ.
    Now all entities on the field are places as potential salvage and there is a new checkbox
    for having them escape (they won't count in terms of salvage value either way) from the
    battle. I chose this route because otherwise it would not allow the next part. That next
    part is that enemy personnel are now loaded into MekHQ's end screen and you have 3 options
    with them: prisoner, bondsman, escaped.

+ Bug [#464]: Repiar: Small Craft
    While this wasn't actually a bug as written, I found that the code for automatically assigning techs for small craft, DropShips,
    and jumpships was in the wrong place. Now that it's moved, the Ships' crews will automatically be assigned to their repairs and
    complete them. No longer will you need to manually start the repairs.
+ Feature: Adjusted the campaign.newDay() repair code again from bug #464 in order to allow manual prioritization of the repairs
    When you first resolve you can manually start a repair. That repair will be prioritized as first. Each time a component completes,
    you can manually start another to have it be the next, or let the rest be handled by the auto-system

    of the controlling factions and such as well.

+ Bug: New rank system was still writing out ranks for the stock systems. As these systems are no longer editable, we don't need to do this
+ Bug: When editing ranks, it should automatically change the ranks dropdown to Custom and the canon ranks should not be editable

+ Major update to the Personnel Market (WIP)
  There are now four methods of randomization to choose from.
  Dylan's method and the Random (original implementation) method both generate daily, but don't "clear"
  Dylan's method uses a weighted version of the Random method to frequently choose personnel for your most common unit type(s)
  Random method is totally random, though it now has options on how personnel are removed based on roll on 2d6 (if it's less than that target)
  FM:Mercs Revised method is as close as I could code to what that book offers with a couple of TODO for roll modifiers
  StratOps method follows the rules in StratOps based on whatever you set your Maint. Cycle as
  This is still a WIP and there are currently no tooltips for the options.
