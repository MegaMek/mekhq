# (Unofficial) Advanced Medical

Advanced Medical (AM) is intended to replace the standard BattleTech method of dealing with injuries and add a level of
realism for campaign play. Using AM, each pilot hit is assigned to a specific body location (head, left arm, right arm,
chest, abdomen, left leg or right leg). Each hit has a chance to be a critical hit that causes double damage, and
additionally, the chance for critical hits increases based on the number of hits the soldier has suffered. The number of
hits a location suffers determines the level of the injury. Injuries can range from cuts/bruises that require almost no
medical attention and do not affect combat performance, to broken bones that temporarily affect combat performance to
lost limbs that permanently affect combat skill.

Using Advanced Medical, most pilots with one hit will be back in the field the next day with no repercussions, while a
pilot with five hits will vary from the very lucky that ends up with no/almost no time out (assuming few or no critical
hits and all the hits landing on different locations) to losing a limb or suffering another long-term or permanent
injury.
