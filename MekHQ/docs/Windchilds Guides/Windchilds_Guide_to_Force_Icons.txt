Folder System:
The origin folder is /data/images/force, which contains all potential force icons. Any folder below it, excluding /Pieces/ and /Units/, contain standard force icons (although you may select an image from any of the folders to use as a standard force icon). Finally, a file with the name empty.png must be included in the origin folder, as that is used as a default fallback image.
/Pieces/: This contains the pieces used to create the layered force icon. This is split into eight subfolders, each one a layer of the overall icon. No other folders will be loaded from for layered force icons, but all folders under them can be loaded (check how /Pieces/Types/ is organized as an example).
/Pieces/Adjustments/: This contains various adjustments to apply to the icon.
/Pieces/Alphanumerics/: This contains various alphanumerics to apply to the icon.
/Pieces/Backgrounds/: This contains various backgrounds for the icon.
/Pieces/Formations/: This contains the potential BattleTech formations.
/Pieces/Frames/: This contains frames to surround the force icon with.
/Pieces/Logos/: This contains various faction logos.
/Pieces/Special Modifiers/: This contains any special modifiers to add to the icon.
/Pieces/Types/: This contains the various types for the icon.
/Units/: This contains unit icon images, and by default has no folders below it.
