Windchild's Guide to Loading Portraits in MekHQ
Written 08-Feb-2020, Updated 05-Aug-2020, 01-Nov-2021.
MekHQ version 0.49.5

How Portrait Loading Works:
The basic structure for loading a portrait is that it first determines the gender of the person, then looks for a folder located under the gender for a folder with the exact name of the primary role (see below for a list of possible primary roles). If that folder doesn't exist, is empty, or contains only pictures which are already assigned, the system continues with the next round of checking.
The system then checks for specialist grouping folders (see below), if it applies to the role. If that folder doesn't exist, is empty, or contains only pictures which are already assigned, the system continues with the next round of checking.
Next, the system looks in the general grouping folders (see below). If that folder doesn't exist, is empty, or contains only pictures which are already assigned, the system continues with the next round of checking.
Finally, it checks the gendered folders.

If the system finds at least one eligible picture in one of the checked folders, it stops searching the folders and picks a random picture from the eligible ones in that folder. Note that this stops the search, so if you put pictures in both /Male/MekWarrior and /Male/Combat, Male MekWarriors will never be assigned one of the pictures in the combat folder unless all the Male MekWarrior-specific pictures are already assigned.


Folder Lists:
To be loaded, the portrait must be located in one of the following folders. To determine the path required, you take the Primary Folder and add the Gendered Folder, then the folder beneath it (outside of the Admin subtypes, which will require the creation of the general Admin folder followed by their specification folder)
For example, I want to load a group of portraits that are only for Male MekWarriors in version 0.49.5. The folder I would need to have to place these portraits into would therefore be mekhq-windows-0.49.5/data/images/portraits/Male/MekWarrior
As a second example, I have a portrait that can be used by Female Admin in version 0.49.5. The folder I would need to place this portrait in would be mekhq-windows-0.49.5/data/images/portraits/Female/Admin
As a third example, I have a portrait that can only be used by Female Admin/HR in version 0.49.5. The folder I would need to have to place this portrait in would be mekhq-windows-0.49.5/data/images/portraits/Female/Admin/HR

Primary Folder: All portraits are located in the portraits folder, just replace the version of mekhq with the current version.
mekhq-windows-0.49.5/data/images/portraits

The following follows the format:
Grouping						/Folder Name

Gendered Folders: Note that all of the below MUST be added to one of the two gendered folders or the portraits will not load
Male Portraits:					/Male
Female Portraits:				/Female

Specialist Grouping Folders: (see below for what are in these groupings)
Administrators:					/Admin
Techs:							/Tech
Medical Staff:					/Medical
Vessel Crewmembers:				/Vessel Crew

General Grouping Folders:
Combat Personnel:				/Combat
Support Personnel:				/Support


For the Specialist Grouping Folder, the following roles are included in the groupings:
Administrators: Admin/Command, Admin/HR, Admin/Logistical, Admin/Transport
Techs: Mek Tech, Mechanic, Aerospace Tech, Battle Armour Tech
Medical Staff: Doctor, Medic
Vessel Crewmembers: Vessel Pilot, Vessel Gunner, Vessel Crewmember, Hyperspace Navigator


Post-0.50.10 Compatibility:
Following the vehicle crew update in 0.50.10 some portrait folders changed, and the Vehicle Gunner folder was removed.

For your existing campaigns you will need to rename your folders to match the new format. For Vehicle Gunners, all
portraits have been moved to the Vehicle Crew Ground folder. MekHQ will automatically know to look there, so you should
do the same.
