#1: Leadership lets you bring extra auxiliary units for free (where an "auxiliary unit" is any unit of a different type than the majority of the lance and of lower BV than the lowest-BV unit in the lance)
So: give your lance leaders leadership points, and keep some lower-BV units (tanks, aerospace fighters, whatever) around so you can bring extra stuff to a fight

#2: Keep some lances on the "fight" role or keep some Support/Campaign Victory Points. That way, if a fight seems unfair, you can bring an extra lance in Or two.

#3: On Independent and Liaison command rights, you're expected to complete the strategic objectives. On Liaison+ command, you're expected to maintain positive campaign VP.

#4: If you have a lance on 'defend' role, keep some extra infantry/battle armor around, you can deploy those "for free" if that lance gets into a scenario.(number is dependent on lance leader tactics skill)

#5: Take out or capture hostile facilities (especially "[unit type] base") ASAP, as they will add extra guaranteed lances of hostile reinforcements into a fight on that track. But if you can capture and hold them, then you get allied buddies coming in to help you instead.

#6: Pay attention to scenario objectives - some scenarios you'll have an easier time with if you don't try to destroy everything. For example, the "pursuit" or "breakthrough" scenarios are best done at night with fast, jump-capable units (or hell, VTOLs). For facilities you're trying to take out, you can just destroy the turrets and bug out if you can't take the garrison.

Coming soon (TM): You can convert Campaign Victory Points to support points and support points to "bonus parts" if you're having trouble getting that replacement mobile hyper pulse generator or other ridiculously rare/extinct part.
