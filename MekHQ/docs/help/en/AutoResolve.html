        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Auto Resolve feature is a way to let the PrincessBot control your units so she can quickly play out the battles
            for you, its pretty straight forward to setup and use if you want to focus on your company management or just dont
            want to play every single lengthy battle.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
        <p>Auto Resolve is available as a new option in the Scenario panel, the button &quot;Auto Resolve&quot; will setup the game scenario
            on MegaMek as normal, and then it adds a Princess bot with the name following the format YourCompany:AI, it is setup
                as the player is setup, same starting position, color, camouflage and team, and then all the players units change owner
                to it.</p>
        <p>To make the game faster, you can change configuration to not show the reports between phases, and select the skip
            action if no available unit, with those options selected the game will not request you to press Done between those
            phases.</p>
        <h2 id="configuring-the-auto-resolve-behavior">Configuring the Auto Resolve Behavior</h2>
        <p>The configuration is accessible in the <strong>Manage Campaign</strong> menu, in the MekHQ toolbar, there is the entry
            <strong>Auto Resolve Behavior Settings</strong>, it will open the <strong>Configure Princess Bot</strong> window, where you can define the
            behavior for the auto resolve preset.</p>
        <p>By default, every campaign now have an auto-resolve default preset, that is named YourCompany:AI, you can change the
            configuration as you like and select whatever preset you want.</p>
        <p>Whenever you hit the &quot;OK&quot; button the current configuration being shown overwrites the auto resolve preset
            for your company, so if you want to experiment with different behaviors, I suggest that you create new presets and then
            just select the one you want before hitting &quot;OK&quot; to close the configuration.</p>
        <h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: What are its current limitations?</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunatelly Princess, being part of an honorable bloodline, she will abide by the Ares Convention and won&#39;s ever shoot at
            retreating units, this means that any scenario to stop enemies from reaching the other side of the map will fail, and every mission
            where she has to reach the other side of the map will succeed, both without firing a single shot. She is also resource heavy, so
            any scenario with too many VTOLs or Hovertanks or too many units overall can be slugsh.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I change the configuration during the game?</strong></p>
        <p>Sure, its a Princess Bot, so all chat commands to change behavior apply</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I change the configuration for a specific scenario?</strong></p>
        <p>Also yes, you can create many presets, like for example one for a scape scenario, another for a defend scenario, etc.
            Just remember to change the selected preset behavior before entering the game with auto resolve. And remember to change
            it back later to your &quot;default&quot; preset.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I change the configuration for a specific unit?</strong></p>
        <p>No, you can&#39;t, you can emulate that by manually creating many bots with different configurations and then assigning
            individual units or lances to them, but that is outside the current scope of the Auto Resolve.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I deleted my company preset! Is everything lost?</strong></p>
        <p>You lost the configuration, sure, but MekHQ won&#39;t make any fuss about it, if you delete it by mistake inside MegaMek,
            once you open the <strong>Auto Resolve Behavior Settings</strong> again, the default preset will be recreated for you. And if it is
            missing before you enter an auto resolve game, it will use the default behavior for the Princess Bot instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: I want to share my preset with my friends, how can I do that?</strong></p>
        <p>It&#39;s just a preset, so you can use the same way you used to share it with your friends before.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: The preset is written to the campaign save?</strong></p>
        <p>No, the preset is saved in the MekHQ configuration folder, so it&#39;s available for all your campaigns, not just the one
            that created it. So... if you create two different campaigns with the same name they would use the same preset.
            Also means that if you change the preset in one save file, the preset is the same in your other campaign. Remember, it
            is a preset that you are telling MekHQ to use, not a campaign specific configuration.</p>
